"Honestly, very rarely do I leave a negative feedback on a store but this place of business was very rude and ZERO customer service! 

My husband went into the store for a specific tool, and the second he walked in, the store employees automatically thought he was there to steal. 

They first started by having a female associate follow him through every aisle he was in! When he finally realized he was being followed he asked the lady if she was following him, and her response was ""it's my job!"" 

We are honest, hard-working people so we have no reason to steal.

After confronting the store associate, she called her manager over and he specifically says ""I know your people, I know what you came here to do!"" And demanded he leave, so he did.

I'm not sure if there has been too much shoplifting going on there but not every BROWN person is there to steal! 

 Needless to say, we will stick to Home Depot :)",1.0

"Went there with my family for a casual quick dinner.

The atmosphere seems like a divey-bar turned into a restaurant-I mean this is a very cute and charming way.  

Food is very value, dinner is approximately $15/person and large portions are given.  My only call out is that the food is quite salty, but the attentiveness of the waitress, who is always there to fill up your glass, definitely helps.

I would recommend the oxtail for sure.

Restaurant is definitely 5 stars for service.  The one waitress that was working was very sweet and attentive- she gave us free wings (which were delicious) as the perogies were sold out.  There seemed to quite a few regulars there as well.",4.0
"Almost missed it as we drove down the street. Came just in time for a table for two without a wait for brunch last weekend. I absolutely loved the soft scrambled eggs. As an egg enthusiast, I must say that I'm still thinking of how delicious it was. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken waffles, which he thought was just ok. He requested medium for his spice level but it tasted more like mild. The waitress offered him a side of the spicer sauce if needed while we were ordering but she forgot to bring it with our meals. Didn't bother to ask for the sauce after a while as we were mostly done with our meals. We loved the affordable prices as well. I'd come back again for sure if in the area again.",4.0
"I came in for a works package before I went on a cross country trip. My experience here was pretty ridiculous. First off I was greeted by the writer, he was alright, the exchange was quick and I was off to waiting. About 45 minutes later he calls me saying that the so called ""technician"" couldn't get my lug nuts off so they wouldn't do my rotate, of course I questioned this and I told him that I want to come a look and then he threw in a quick ""also you need an air filter"" and once he said that I knew I was going to have to hurt some feelings once I looked at it because it was brand new. Anyway, I walked up to my car to be greeted by this goofy looking kid. I watched him sit there and let his impact hit my lug it for 10 seconds or so on full power as a ""demonstration"" and it's funny because a month prior I had rotated my tires myself... Without a single issue and let me make note that I usually do my own vehicle maintenance but I was 2,000 miles away from home and I had nowhere to do it at. Anyway... I told him that and he tried giving me this explanation like I was an idiot... So I told him he was wrong but since this ""technician"" is merely to incompetent to zip off some lug nuts I canceled the rotate because I knew that this high speed motherfucker would end up snapping off all of my studs and then I'd really be in for a ride. So I said requested to see me filter, he pulls out a literal brand new filter that had a very few VERY LARGE pieces of acorn in it that I literally picked out with my finger, I couldn't help myself, I started laughing at this guy. I the. Proceeded to explaining to him how you properly inspect and air filter... Making sure to talk slow enough for him to understand, I showed him that you check the physical appearance of the filter, is the filter black, and I showed him that you should hold it up to a light to check and see if there is any light coming through it and I shit you now this kid literally had acted like he had never heard this before... I handed it back to him and said pick out the large pieces of debris and put it back and next time try not to sell something that doesn't needed to be sold because you won't always get away with it idiot. So, after that I was asking the writer how much it would be since I wasn't getting the rotate and he said it would knock off $5... $5!!!!! THATS FUCKING IT. At this point I was so pissed, and now I had to explain to the writer how this made no sense and how in the flat rate system that ford uses that a rotate pays 5/10ths of an hour and an oil change pays 2/10ths if it's on a gas engine or 5/10ths if it's on a Diesel engine... And I got to thee here I was like ""now, how does that make any fucking sense to you"" obviously this dude was at a large loss for words because of all of the factual information that I just provided to him, the only response he could give was ""that's just how much it is"" so I was like ALRIGHT! I paid the ridiculous amount for some stupid mouth breather to change my oil and I left. ALSO! As I was leaving... The cashier said my keys were in my car and I was all set, I walked out to my car and they weren't there, so I had to sit there for 15 extra minutes while I watched all of their porters sit there with their dicks in there hands trying to find my keys that they misplaced. HERES WHERE IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!! The company emailed me a survey request, and after thoroughly filling it out and literally typing out every single thing that would happen it told me that they are sorry for my negative experience and that someone would contact me in 3-4 days... It's been a month and I haven't heard a god damn thing from this crooked place. The staff that I dealt with didn't have a fucking clue what they were talking about, the ""technician"" was undertrained... Or should I say completely lacking any training at all, and the facility sucked. The service department here is one giant pile of steaming fucking shit who seriously needs to consider un-fucking themselves. Overall... Fuck this place.",1.0
upon entrance we were greeted with positive energy. it was my first time here and the atmosphere was really nice. polite service for amazing food. the cashier took the order in a well manner and recited it back. the food came out in a timely manner and gave me time to reminisce on the tv that was playing dbz's cell game. good was good and service was amazing. a+ for the hentai on the painting by the bathroom!,5.0
"Service and ambience are both good. I find those are two things that the restaurants in the Southpoint do surprisingly well. I almost couldn't decide between a three or four star rating, but I decided to round up because I love their eggplant parmesan so much. 

I've been here three times, and each time it was great. Nothing worse than ordering something you loved before and getting a crappy version the next time. Bonus points for consistency. The eggplant is tender and layered with wonderful creamy ricotta filling, excellent marinara, and topped with a thick golden layer of bubbling mozzarella. $17 worth of heaven.

The bread basket is nice- two flavors of ciabatta rolls: plain and topped with sun dried tomatoes. It comes with a dish of garlic cloves and roasted peppers in oil, and if you get your pretty sister to bat her eyelashes at the waiter, you will also get butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. A yummy little bread buffet.

My sis loves the grilled shrimp appetizer. I found it just ok- tends to be overcooked and a little tough. (Which still beats undercooked and slimy). Shrimp are hard to get to that perfect doneness, but they ARE professionals.

Babygirl likes the Chicken Angelo, which I find good but not the best version I've ever had. Makes me nostalgic for the old Cosmo's Underground.

Dessert is kind of weak.( Not unexpected in an Italian restaurant- the only thing I usually like are cannolis anyway) . Little guy had the coconut sorbet, which was served in a real shell and garnished nicely, but frozen too hard and somewhat flavorless.

And speaking of flavorless, my biggest complaint is the salad course. It's kind of a Catch 22 : it's too small, and it doesn't taste very good. SO, you want a bigger salad, but not THAT salad. They call it caesar, but you can detect almost none of the wonderful pungent, earthy flavors it should have. It's just a little bowl of watery, flavorless. shredded lettuce. I'm thinking they cut down down the portions to avoid waste when they saw how much was being returned to the kitchen. But the problem was not that they were giving too much, but that nobody liked it. Get a clue, Don Vito's: enough people have complained about the salad, so fix it!
It's not that hard. And while you're at it, take that shrimp off the fire a minute earlier. 

Thank you.",4.0
"I'm reviewing the Korean food bazaar event that took place at the church...great event - huge turnout! First of all, parking sucks so get there earlier because trying to find a spot seems impossible- there are parking garages/areas around walnut street so park there and walk to the church - that seems the least frustrating. It was our first time attending so it was a little confusing at first trying to figure out the event layout and then we got distracted from the food with the awesome little flea market there!  I got a super cute fur cuffed/collared denim jacket for only $5! My sister got a coach cross body bag for $10! And some great shirts and sweaters for only $1.  Unfortunately we came too late for what I really came for which was the bibimbap.  The event was supposed to go till 4 and we got there around 1 so they ran out of a lot of food early.  The bulgogi was amazing and the chicken was tasty too but I will admit I was disappointed they ran out of the bibimbap and several other things I was going to get instead but this event was totally worth going.  It's a little spread out so there are lines for food outside but there is also food in the church 1st floor as well as the basement so don't make a rookie move and miss out on checking out those areas before waiting in the huge line outside at the grill.  Next time I'll come early and get my bibimbap!!",4.0
"My 2014 KIA Forte that had under 53K miles and under warranty died. I took it to this location because I've had all of the service for this car completed here.  The full experience of having your car die to find out it needs a new motor is highly frustrating. The worst part was that KIA made it more frustrating.  I had to fight for a loaner, waited a full two months to get the car back and when I asked for updates they would tell me they didn't have an update on the parts.  
I originally started working with Luke when this process began and he gave me his number to call or to text.  When he called to tell me that the car needed a new motor he originally told me it was going to cost 5000 or more dollars!  So I also had to fight for them to honor the warranty!!!!!!! 

Finally this past Week the car was ready but I was away on vacation and the loaner was stuck at my house.  I received 1 voicemail from Luke to tell me the car was ready and to let him know when I could pick it up. I called back the next morning and told him in a voicemail that I was out of town and could return the loaner and pick up my car onJuly 3rd. The following day while on vacation I had a voicemail from Tim the Service manager who told me in an irritated tone that my car was ready and they needed the loaner for someone else.  I was dumbfound by the comment and couldn't believe that Luke didn't relay these details.  So on my vacation I called Tim back who also didn't answer and told him that I already explained all of this to Luke and to please call me back to make the arrangements. NO RETURN CALL!!!.  So today I called in the morning and asked for Luke and Tim and Rich who answered the phone didn't give me to either one.  So I left work when I could and randomly showed up.  The man who didn't have a name tag was more worried about the loaner than making sure I was satisfied with the car.  Complete garbage and the worst service I've ever received.  I will never by a KIA again and I will NEVER go back to this location.  I believe that Tim the ""Service Manager"" is a waste of space and he only teaches his employees the worst concepts of customer service.",1.0

Pinto beans are always perfect, as are the black beans. The tortas are delish. Literally cannot say anything bad about the place, except maybe they need a soda fountain.

I was in room 2508 in building C of a section called the circus manor. Feels a little bit like a concentration camp. Biggest negative point: you are at the far end of the strip and have to take a bus or walk 30 minutes to get to the center of the strip.",2.0
It took a long while but we finally figured out what was still old-school about Vegas and it's the manner at Circus Circus a three level row of hotel rooms behind Circus Circus without ballet that has self parking and you don't need to use elevators this truly is the right place for my father 83 years old still smoking still Kickin ass and still playing slot machines like there's no tomorrow thank God you're still a piece of Vegas that reminds us of what Vegas used to be,4.0
"we had a weekend at planet hollywood but wanted to stay in vegas an extra night. they sent us a deal for circus circus which ended up being like 32$ it's at the end of the strip but we didn't mind walking (that's what you do in vegas anyway).  for those of us on a budget, this was the way to go! 

the room was fine ( who wants to hang out in the room?) for us and was clean. it was also pretty spacious. the casino had a little of everything too. shops, restaurants, and of course gambling. we got a little coupon book with a BUNCH of deals in it like free drinks and stuff. 

an unexpected bonus was the performances. they do circus performances upstairs in the casino several times a day and the ones we saw were pretty amazing. contortionists and acrobats really blew us away, and the greatest part? FREE. aww yea!

all in all this was a great deal. if you're looking for a cheap place to lay your head at night, this is the way to go. good luck finding a hotel room at motel 6 for under 40$, much less a hotel in vegas",4.0
"Excellent Lunch Menu!

My Kiwanis Club meets here on Thursdays at 12:15pm, so I'm quickly becoming a regular.  I've tried to taste as many options from their lunch offerings as I can and I've yet to find one that I wouldn't order a second time.  Perhaps the only caveat to that would be that the fish & chips goes a little heavy on the breading around the fish so it fills you up with dough/batter rather than wish fish.

Service is quick.  The wait staff knows their stuff.  And the view (ask for the river view!) is tremendous.  For those looking to get away from the downtown hustle and bustle but want to stay accessible to work, the Grand Concourse is certainly an option that will not disappoint.",3.0

"I like Ducks. They're crazy (hence where Daffy got his name). So I felt that Grenadier Pond, the top duck hang-out of the city, deserved a separate shout-out from High Park.

Even in winter (yes WINTER) this pond is lovely. The ice is sort of partially frozen in spots so you have that crystal effect along the water, the tall bull rushes rim the edges like a majestic fence (oh yes, I said MAJESTIC) and the ducks! They're still there, man! And when you walk up to the edge they'll get a little closer, just to see if you've got food but it's cool because those mean old geese are gone, so it's just you and the ducks. The crazy daffy ducks.

"Food and service was quite good.  Prices a little high but not unreasonable.  We had traditional spaghetti and meatballs, risotto of the day (vegetable and shrimp) and ravioli in sage-butter sauce.  The huge meatball was authentic Italian, the sage-butter sauce excellent and the risotto creamy and flavorful.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The house Chianti was very good.  We will definitely go back again soon and try some of their more sophisticated meals, such as the veal saltimbocca.  When trying an Italian restaurant for the first time, we always start with basic meals, then work up to the more complex offerings.  Perhaps our next visit will boost the rating to 5 stars.  One observation, which is not uncommon in the Las Vegas area.  The wait staff, while extremely polite and attentive, frequently use ""you guys"" when addressing the table and respond with ""no problem"" instead of ""you're welcome"".  This is a very minor point, but it is what separates the service in a bistro from a restaurant.",4.0
"Walter and Alejandra have been fantastic in making my visit extremely memorable.

First and foremost, I was greeted by Walter at the door. He showed us to our table where our party was already settled. We had a party of about 12.

Anyways, the food choices were fantastic and the wine list was phenomenal.

I thoroughly enjoyed the placement of the food... but the FLAVOUR! It was exceedingly amazing!

I don't even know where to start the review... so I'll just cluster them by courses.

1st Course:
We had lots and lots of different appetizers. We had children with us so it was important that they would enjoy it, too.

2nd Course:
Salad. You can't mess this up. But Alejandra made it soooo delicious!

3rd Course:
Dinner. We chose different kinds from fish, chicken and meats. The adults enjoyed their meals and said many good things, but I was more interested on what the youngest of our party had to say, Braden.

""This was sooo good! My stomach can't fit any more!""

4th Course:
Dessert. I wish I made room for dessert! But nevertheless, Alejandra made them for us and I must say I didn't feel all gross after our gastric spectacular feast!

Walter and Alejadra are fantastic hosts and chef. I greatly recommend this for family outings, special events (please call them so they have a heads up and know how much to prepare!), or just a simple lunch/dinner with a special someone.


Note: I do wish to visit this place again when I am in the area just to verify the consistency of their foods. But from my own experience of growing up eating Italian food back in the east coast and frequenting NYC, this place was home away from home.

"We had an amazing experience at Kinderland Cafe from beginning to end. I booked a 2 hour private slot for my son's first birthday party and I'm beyond glad that this is the place we chose. They did everything in their power to make things fun, easy and enjoyable for everyone. 
The play area suits so many age groups, this was the primary reason I chose them since it's nowhere near my home. I brought decor the day before the party and when I arrived most items where set up, there were no stragglers from the previous party and they were ready to get the ball rolling.
My guests couldn't have been happier and my family was beyond impressed. My son is so tuckered out from all the fun he's still asleep at 10am the next morning! Lol  We were never rushed towards the door when our time was up and I wasn't even rushed to pay my balance. The staff was kind, professional and the facility was cleaner than I could have ever imagined. 
My only nitpick would be that wish I would have booked a third hour since I had a few friends that were a little late and I wish they had ice cream scoops and a freezer but I couldnt nitpick about anything else.....Lord knows us yelpers try! Haha

"Every time I'm driving on the Eastside of town between 11-3 I try to stop in for a quick bite at Tacos El Gordo. The food is usually quick, although it can get very crowded at times. I love the Asada Quesadillas with everything on them. The Asada is much saltier than I would prefer but adding lime helps cut through it. 

El Gordo reminds me of getting street tacos in TJ or Baja when I was in high school. It's authentic and a couple years ago it would be a 4 star but the novelty of remembering my many trips to Mexico is starting to depreciate and the meat is tasting saltier than I remember. 

Overall if you want the real deal stop in and remember they have different lines depending on the type of meat you want so don't be the guy who stands around because he can't figure it out.",3.0
"Oh geez, where do I start.  I've heard so much hype about the tacos here and I was excited to finally make it to the Las Vegas Blvd. location to get some to go.  There was no parking so my bf dropped me off while he circled the parking lot.  As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed. It was like a crazy zoo with people just everywhere. It was hard to tell where to order as there were 6-8 lines.  I grabbed a tray and jumped into one of these lines. I was maybe the 15th person back so it was a bit of a wait.  When I finally got up to the window, the guy serving informed me that the meat I wanted, asada, was not available in that line and I needed to go to another line.  Actually, he kind of yelled all of this at me in Spanish and after going back and forth for a few minutes I finally understood his irritated frantic pointing to the signs taped to the glass in front of him.  Frustrated and defeated, I slowly made my way all to the way to the back of another line and waited and waited 15 more minutes.

Finally I got up to the front of the line and it was smooth sailing from here.  I ordered 3 asada, 3 chorizo, and 3 adobada.  Once I got the food, I didn't know what to do since they were on a plate on my tray and I needed them to go.  I must have looked like a lost puppy because one of the workers cleaning up the soda machine asked me if I needed help and with huge relief I said yes, I needed these to go.  So he directed me to the cashier and said she'd put them in a to go back for me after I paid.  Done and done! I got back in the car and we immediately started going to town on these bad boys. I must say, they were amazing and worth every frustrated minute of waiting in line.   Can't wait to go back and do it all over again, except this time, I know what line to get into!!",4.0

"My experience? It was great to start but ended with big disappointment.

When I found out about this place I was ecstatic because there's no izakaya in Phoenix area. Yes, there are sushi and fast-food type places but nothing like izakaya. So, just for that reason I gave it 5 stars. 

In our party we had 4 adults and a 19 month old baby. We sat at a table around 5:30pm and the service was soooooo slow it took about 4 hours to get all of our food. We left around 9:30pm. For that reason alone I deducted 2 points. 

Cooked food was pretty decent but sushi was not so fresh and tasteless. Sake was overpriced and beer was warm. So, i deducted another point. 

This place is also not kid friendly so minus another point. There was no crayons or anything to keep a child busy and there was no changing station in the bathroom either. Luckily the baby was well behaved and didn't get too agitated but other kids in the restaurant were screaming. 

We had to ask for our order numerous times and average service time took 20-30 min for each order. One of the dish we ordered was so salty we asked them to take it back. 

This places is very small with 3 waitresses and several cooks so you think they have this down but they seemed very confused and customer service was very poor. I understand this is a new establishment but hope they get their act straight so they don't disappoint more customers.

Our waiters were a tad cold and lacked that ability to make us feel welcome.  The food is the main reason for the 3 stars.  It's pretty good but not outstanding.  In other words, the cuisine here is not like Elements or the quality of Cafe Monarch.  I would even say that Quiessence was better cuisine even though I much prefer the atmosphere here.

"I decided to give this place a try after reading about it on insauga.com as the #1 place to get wings in Mississauga. I tried two flavours, Interview with a Vampire (spicy garlic parmesan) and Kama Sutra (medium spice + ranch).

I LOVE Interview with a Vampire. I've had spicy gar par at many places before and this is definitely one of my favourites. Kama Sutra was disappointing. The sauce tasted watered down. I also had potato wedges with dill sauce, which was really good. The potato wedges had some seasoning on it that give it some flavour.

The service was great. Food arrived in a timely manner. Our server checked on us periodically (not too much and not too little). The ambiance is exactly what you would expect for a pub. It's not a fine dining environment but it's great for hanging out with some friends and having beer and wings.",4.0
"Overall, Luce is one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  Delicious food (the gnocchi was amazing), excellent wait staff, wonderful atmosphere.  If I was a ""playa"", I'd take my date here for the sure win in the restaurant category.

We were in town for the Charlotte Heroes Comic Con and stopped here for dinner.   When we walked in, I immediately felt under dressed.  Even though every other customer was in fully casual attire (more likely due to the nearby comic event), the restaurant immediately strikes you as an upscale, formal attire venue.  The decorating is simple, yet beautiful, with large white columns, soft romantic lighting and a big brass chandelier over the main dining area.   

Every single course was interesting, beautiful and delicious.  A bread basket with a variety of bread was brought with a small bowl of oil and cannelloni beans.  The bread as a bit on the hard side on the outside, but still very tasty and just filling enough to curb your appetite.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which comes with fried calamari, topped with shredded and fried zucchini, with two different sauces for dipping.  We were both surprised by the shredded zucchini, but it was delicious and an excellent addition the crispy yet soft calamari.

For entrees I ordered the gnocchi, and my gf ordered the pesto.  They were both delicious.  The pesto had lots of flavor, with the pasta being soft and tender.  It was great.  Here's the thing though.  The gnocchi was so good, it almost ruined the pesto.   I've had a lot of Italian food, and tried gnocchi a few times.  Each time I've tried gnocchi, it's been prepared al-dente which imo has made it too much on the chewy side.  This gnocchi was soft.  Not mushy, but soft and the texture combined with the large chunks of fresh mozzarella  was wonderful.  The tomato based sauce it was in, was easily some of the best I'd ever had.  The flavor wasn't complex.  It was just the best of the flavors in tomato sauce, amplified.   It was not only the best gnocchi we'd ever had, it was one of the best Italian-style dishes I'd ever eaten.

For dessert we ordered the Semi-freddo.  It's a small sweet bit of ice cream with some sort of yummy nougat inside, with a few assorted fresh berries on the side.  It was tasty, and the flavors of the ice-cream and fresh berries mixed perfectly.

The restaurant isn't very large, but that only adds to charm and intimacy of the atmosphere.  The hostess was professional, and personable and sat us at a table out of the way.  Our waiter was polite and friendly (but not too friendly.  You know what I mean.).  It's important to note, that the entire wait staff was sharp, clean and well dressed.  None of that half-assed, ""I'm abiding by the dress code, but I really just rolled out of bed"" look.  I'm ok with that most times, but the wait staff of the night obviously put some effort into looking crisp, and it added to the high class feel of the place.  

In addition to looking and behaving posh and professional, the wait staff also managed to always be near enough to get you something if you needed it, but rarely so intrusive that they were a bother.  The small size of the restaurant and the number of staff hit the perfect balance of availability and perceived absence.  We never felt annoyed at their presence or lack thereof.

As for the price, well,  ""If you ain't got no 'monay, take yo broke ass home.""  (or to another, more fiscally friendly venue, whichever)",5.0

"NEWLY RENOVATED Buffet at Aria. For those who have eaten here in the past, Let's me tell you The Buffet at Aria has undergone a huge overhaul of its old buffet and it now looks better and fresher than before to try and compete with Wicked Spoon and most of all The Bacchanal Buffet. From what I read online, they spent nearly 3.5 millions to makeover their old buffet.

Here's a Full Steady HD Tour of the Newly Renovated  ""The Buffet"" at Aria that I recorded over the past weekend. or just go on youtube and type "" Newly Renovated Buffet at Aria.""

or click on the YouTube link below to watch my video that I recorded of the buffet

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYpILdqTXyI

The video was recorded during the dinner rush. 

It costs 40 bucks for dinner. 

This is the only buffet I believe to have Alaskan King Crab legs on the Strip. Even Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace doesn't have King Crab Legs. They have a varieties of Sushi rolls to choose from. They even serve jumbo shrimp that I don't see at other buffets on the strip.

They even have a cool rotating Ice Cream Bar.

Overall, I have to say this Newly Renovated Buffet is definitely up to par with Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal Buffet.

Like I said above, If you guys want to see how the newly renovated buffet looks like I have recorded a HD video of the newly makeover Buffet at Aria:

"I did not stay here, just came for the casino. I don't see anything exceptional about this place. There's nothing really unique to distinguish it from other casinos. The neon sign is kind of cool, but there are neon signs everywhere! It's not even on the Strip- you have to take a shuttle. Technically, you could walk, but the path includes a major highway, so it's not like it would be pleasant or scenic stroll. If you're looking for a place to stay, I'd suggest spending a little more and staying on the Strip.",2.0
"The suite was nice.  The view was wonderful.  The employees and customer service were great.  The only problem was that music could be heard late at night.  We were on the 37th floor so I guess the music was coming from the Voodoo Lounge.  I guess this would not be a problem if this was our going out Vegas trip.  This trip was our relaxation, early show trip.  We still had an enjoyable time.  Love the Diamond Lounge here. The fact that the Rio offers a free shuttle to the strip is great!",3.0
"During a recent Vegas trip for Christmas/birthday celebrations, my husband and I stayed here with my in-laws. My in-laws chose this particular hotel because they have stayed here previously and wanted to go to the Rock of Ages show - which was playing here. We stayed three days and two nights during the week a few days prior to Christmas. (Side note: I would not recommend staying so close to Christmas because a lot of places were closed for the holidays.) Upon arrival, we drove around trying to find a place to park and check in. There was parking but it was on the opposite side of the check in area. So, we parked, then had to walk across the entire hotel before finding the check in. During this walk, many hotel workers stopped us trying to get us to gamble or upgrade or whatever. Finally, after checking in, we had to walk back to the car, drive all the way around to the parking for our specific room area (there are two areas for parking because there are two different towers for rooms). We parked, then had to wander through the hotel again before finding the elevators to our rooms. (Note: During our stay, the elevators went out of service so we had to use the escalators. Then the escalators went out of service, so we had to use the previously not-working elevators. Not sure what was going on, but it became confusing.) The rooms were fine - nothing fancy. They smelled funky - like cigarettes and mouthwash. Overall, it was okay. The location is off the strip but they do have shuttles to the strip (to other hotels owned by whoever owns The Rio). Not sure if I'd come back, as there are much nicer places to stay while in Vegas, but it got the job done during this particular trip.",3.0

Solid little restaurant for a quick pick me up.  I do not understand the baby tacos that i have been experiencing at a lot of these types of restaurant.

"2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100

Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!

GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.

We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.

While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.

I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.

Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.

They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.

What we ordered:

--BREAD--
Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!

--DRINKS--
PIMMS CUP: 
Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.

WYDERS PEAR CIDER:
The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!

--STEAKS--
BEEF WELLINGTON:
So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.

KOBE FILET MIGNON:
My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!

--SIDE DISH--
TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:
I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!

--DESSERT--
STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!

Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!",5.0
"I have to be very honest. I am dumbfounded by all of the great reviews. We went to celebrate a birthday. First, the dining room and the upstairs rooms are loud, and lack any ""charm"" or comfortable setting feeling. It's loud downstairs and upstairs it's like you're eating in someone's closet. It gets worse.

It's expensive, $66 for a ribeye steak, not atypical for Las Vegas, but at this price range and supposedly reputation of Gordon you expect a great steak. NOT!  Medium well came rare. Oh, and it followed the other two guests dinner by five minutes because of some unknown reason. Nothing worse than sitting there not having your food and having your guests waiting to eat theirs because you don't have yours yet.  

Baked potato. Pretty simple preparation. Our $10 big potato came with five marble sized black areas inside the potato. Obviously it was spoiled or bruised or something. We asked the waiter and he said, ""oh, that's sometimes typical"". Really, I've been eating potatoes most of my life and I've never seen one with five large black spots in it. The correct response should've been, ""i'm sorry, let me get you a new one immediately"".

By the way, we never saw our waiter, our original waiter from the time he took the order only until he presented the bill. We had to flag down others.

The other meals, a steak and ahi tuna were OK, nothing special, but nothing special to warrant the high prices. If you're going to charge $50 and up for an entrée, make it a $50 entrée.

I've never eaten in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. And I WON'T ever again.

He's got a captive audience at the Paris Hotel and perhaps the vast majority of people, as evidenced by the ratings, are OK with a mediocre experience and food. Sad ...

So many BETTER choices in Las Vegas. If you want a GREAT steak and experience, go to Morton's or Capital Grill.",1.0
"Foremost, you may wish to consider requesting a booth upstairs. These over-sized, semi-circular areas allow for a much more intimate experience. It was the consensus of our party that it seemed to block noise ... and it also allowed for a nice overview of the vibrant, beautiful establishment.

Additionally, set aside about ninety-minutes for this experience (if you invest in multiple courses). And, let me assure you, it is well worth your time. (Seriously, relish this time away from the cheesy chaos of Vegas). 

Now, our server was the absolute best. (I wish I could remember his name!) He was charming, warm, knowledgeable, and attentive. (The ""meat lecture,"" complete with rolling visual-aids, was fascinating ... trust me, you will enjoy it!) While everyone in my party ordered these lovely pieces of meat, I am a vegetarian (and did not want to spoil anyone's night out). When I told the server, he did not blink (or scoff), instead, he immediately accommodated me (he set me up with a beautiful beet salad and a variety of sides that were the equivalent of a hearty meal). This amazing man also assisted us in selecting the perfect beer to accompany our entrees (the Fin du Monde was simply spot-on). This culinary genius also selected the perfect sauce for each entree ... without hesitation or pretense. 

Each person raved about his/her experience. One person literally said it was the first time in months that someone genuinely got ""medium rare"" right. And, while no one was a bit hungry, we still had to try the sticky toffee pudding. Now, if you have had the push-up pops at BurGr and thought you experienced the ""real deal,"" you have not. The push-up pops are fun (we enjoyed those), but this was AMAZING! The interplay of hot and cold is essential to the enjoyment of this dessert ... try it, you will agree.

In essence, the food was delicious. But, in complete honesty, it was this server that made our experience ""five-stars."" He was not pretentious (as we suspected may happen here and were entire wrong about), he was not ""pushy,"" he was not dismissive ... he was a professional, super nice, sweetheart who literally made our night! (And, we are still talking about him two weeks later!)

Know that this is an experience, not just ""a meal."" Instead of throwing money into a slot machine, why not spend it here, bonding with family and friends. 

Chef Ramsay has certainly created a bastion of sanity in an otherwise crazy place! Thank you so much for that! We will never forget our visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.",5.0

"Ich war letztes Jahr in der Rock'n'Roll Hall of fame und ich muss sagen, meine Erwartungen wurden übertroffen!!! Obwohl es nicht unbedingt ein riesiges Gebäude ist, gibt es darin so viel zu entdecken, dass wir uns einen ganzen Tag dort aufhalten konnten, ohne, dass es auch nur eine Minute langweilig wurde. Von den vielen originalen Ausstellungsstücken, z.B. das Schlagzeug von Van Halen oder die Gitarren von ZZ Top oooder auch eine ganze Ecke rund um die Rolling Stones (die mir besonders gut gefallen hat) bis hin zu vielen Filmsälen, in denen sie Videos rund um die Hall of Fame und frühere Musik-Fernsehshows bringen und einem großen Kinosaal, in dem den ganzen Tag Konzerte laufen (z.B. Bruce Springsteen, Simon and Garfunkel, Tina Turner etc. etc.). 
In der Halle kann man auch Mittag essen, obwohl man dazu vor lauter Eindrücken fast nicht kommt. :-)
Im Erdgeschoss ist, kurz vor dem Ausgang, ein großer Fanshop, in dem man z.B. relativ preiswert T-Shirts von Bands oder der Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame ergattern kann ABER z.B. auch Schallplatten, CD's, Bücher  und andere übliche Souvenirs. Ich habe mir selbst zwei T-Shirts für ca. 50$ der Hall of Fame gekauft und muss sagen, ein super Material, ein schöner Frauenschnitt und auch nach mehrmaligem Waschen sehen sie immer noch neu aus. Ich bin voll und ganz zufrieden.

"I love this place! I often bring my 4 year old and 2 year old here and they always have a great time! They love the playtown as well as the art and puzzle rooms. 

They sell snacks and drinks for very reasonable prices which is a nice plus.

There are also several pricing options -- punch cards, one time passes, yearly memberships which I appreciate.

The new owners are super nice and friendly. They always take the time to make parents and kids feel welcome.

They have recently started offering special activities such as storytime, art classes, etc. as well. 

I took my older daughter to the princess tea party which she absolutely loved. There was a princess on hand to make balloon animals, lead the girls in dances, and paint faces. There were also princess themed activities as well as lots of delicious food that parents and kids could both enjoy.

I used to go into this beauty supply all the time. They stopped carrying the supplies I need and then told me they would order what I needed. Didn't happen. What's worse?

I'm a licensed professional! I don't need to steal anything that you don't carry.

"Absolute Assault on Otherwise Innocent Food!!!!!

What more, beyond the title, can I say?  The menu is unimaginative, especially for Vegas, and the food execution lacks depth of flavor and attention to protein temperature.  Every single dish (eight in total) was over cooked and underneath that failure of temperature was an embarrassing selection of D-grade meats.

Not even the poor choice of sake is worth the calorie consumption.

In any event, I will likely return as they did give me a $40 credit for the trouble (and did not charge for the lost/found items), and it was probably just an oversight to begin with.  I will get a count on my clothes next time.  Thanks Tide for finding my items!",4.0
They charged me for 3 extra pieces of clothing that were not in my order. They will not make it right and management/owner will not return calls. I bet they make a lot of $$ by scamming a couple extra pieces on larger bills because most of the time you don't even check the ticket. SHAME!,1.0
"Came here twice in one day... literally hours apart!

first time we came just got pick up some doubles because we had a craving and we were really happy with their service! Not the mention the doubles tasted amazing.

While we were there we looked at the menu and decided what we did want to come back for.
We usually go to the location down in scarborough so it was nice to know one closer to me was now open.

So we came back to this plaza to get dinner only to be disappointed by the location we visited so we decided to go back to where we were happy.

"Most criticisms for the pizza usually revolve around Midwest sensibilities of how pizza should be. Courthouse is New York Style - the way it's supposed to be (the only other legitimate claim Is Sicilian/Mediterranean as far as authenticity). Chicago has deep dish, but it's a myth that they like deep dish. They prefer thin, NY style as well. They only eat the deep dish pizza when their friends and family come to visit for ""something Chicago"". Lost between Manhattan and Chicago is us where we came up with something in-between the two and it became the norm and default, which is the same reason frozen and franchise pies resemble this as well. In my opinion, this place is great; it's acceptable NY style pizza.",5.0
Great little Greek sandwich spot in Az. Gyros are very tasty and the fries with feta cheese was delicious. Love the Greek music playing in the backround!

Earl is located in the Miles mall of Planet Hollywood. Their bread is made slightly undercooked so that it cooks and toasts fully when the sandwich goes through the conveyor oven with all the filling. Everything was really really good; the bread was always perfectly toasted and piping hot. 

We ate:
Hawaiian: A little too salty, will not get again
Full Montagu: REALLY GOOD!
Earl's Club: Friends said really good
The Original: Also good

Get the full montagu and earl's club definitely. 2 mornings in a row we got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich too - really really good. They serve breakfast until 11, but you can get the other sandwiches any time you want.

"Why hello Holiday Sandwich, we are reunited once again! I wish there were more locations, especially back home in California! 

I first discovered Earl of Sandwich when I was at Downtown Disney in Florida a couple years ago and have been a huge fan since. The closest one to me is at Downtown Disney in California so I was excited to hear there was an Earl of Sandwich during my recent Las Vegas trip. 

I'm a huge fan of holiday sandwiches and this sets the bar for future holiday sandwiches I will try. It not only comes with the usual turkey and cranberry sauce but also STUFFING. Now that's what I call a holiday sandwich. I was so disappointed when I didn't see the holiday sandwich on the menu when I was at Earl of Sandwich in California only later discovering it's available year round. I'll never make that mistake again! 

Anyways, I ordered my usual holiday sandwich again and it didn't disappoint! This is a smaller location than the ones I've been to but the sandwiches are just as yummy! I also got a chocolate chip cookie to go with my meal. It was super chocolate-y and chewy. 

There's something for everyone here, from sandwiches, to salads, to wraps. The bread always tastes freshly baked too. Early of Sandwich is definitely living up to their claim of being the ""World's Greatest Hot Sandwich.""

P.S. Don't forget to order the Earl Gray Lemonade.",4.0
"Hard to review this place.  I'd like to give it a 3.5

"If you had to eat at only 1 place in Las Vegas, this would be it.  Located conveniently in Planet Hollywood, it's the best $5.99 (add $2.99 if you want a cup of soup) you'll spend in Vegas.

Yes, it is, but it is totally delicious.  The sandwiches come wrapped in gold foil, and it's like a hot little brick, all ready for your consumption.",5.0

"Remarkably reasonably priced sandwich (sub-$8) inside a strip casino, but unremarkable in flavor and not worth the typical long lines for it during the times you normally want a sandwich.

By the south end of Planet Hollywood, there can be lines that snack across the long hallway to the shop entrances.  You stand in line, make a choice from the dozen or so sandwiches and then pay at the other end of the counter.

It comes out toasty and warm, and large enough to quell hunger pangs, but the meat - which mostly why you choose that particular sandwich - can be dry and chewy.

But a plus is a plus, and the price, speed that you get your toasty sandwich, and people watching can be worth it.",3.0
"I talked to gun salesman about getting a 22 semiautomatic. I first looked at the Ruger SR22.  I explained that I wanted one that I could use snake shot loads in. He pointed me to the Sig Mosquito. I had researched 22 handguns a couple years back and remember some 22's had issues which I asked about. He told me the Mosquito would be a good gun and didn't have those issues so I bought it. The next day I look at the reviews and everything said they had problems with lots of ammo. I'm sure Snake shot will be one of them and of course I can't find CCI mini-mags anywhere which is the recommended ammo. I feel I must have had sucker written on my forehead and he lead me to a gun they have trouble selling. I'll never buy a gun from Cabelas again, or will make darn sure I don't do an impulse buy and research it heavily before hand. Also found it interesting that I didn't get an owners manual or any of the things that Sig says comes standard with their Mosquito's. Only got the gun, magazine and a standard case without a lock. Maybe it's how Sig's come. My Ruger's came in a form fitting case with an owners manual, quick load and lock.",1.0

"Sonic is Sonic. I grew up without one and lived my whole life until age 19 without one. I'm alive, I'm well, and I'm pretty sure I still see it as another fast food chain and nothing too entirely special. Call me crazy, I'm just not freaking out about it. 

I've only ever had food from Sonic once and that wasn't here, so I can't include that in my review. What I can say is that our service was pretty standard. Nothing horrible and nothing spectacular. Our slushies were great, too. Well, I can only speak for mine. The boyfriend was doped up from getting his wisdom teeth out, so everything was great to him.

Other hotels I have been to have the balcony locked, I guess they are afraid of jumpers. There are many clubs in the area we ended up at haze after bouncing from club to club. Pauly d was the dj witch was pretty cool. Valet service was great although they did not want to take my truck initially on account of my friend puked all over it on they way there.

"Possibly the worst guest experience I've had at a hotel. We were in Vegas for a bachelorette over the weekend and several flights got delayed out of NYC due to bad weather. We're all exhausted and the individual who's name the reservation is under is on a very delayed flight - scheduled to get in at 1AM PST (4PM our local time). She had called earlier to add our name to the reservation, but was told she needed to call Orbitz to do so and they wouldn't allow it. 

We get to the hotel and are not allowed to check in. I ask for options to get comfortable (so many hotels offer showers for travelers who can't check in right away) and I'm told my only option is to book another room for the night. Seriously?! You want me to pay for another room because you won't let me check into the one we already booked?!

What would have happened if the reservation booker's flight got cancelled or rebooked for later in the weekend (which happened to some members of our party)? Their policy would have left us homeless. For being in the hospitality business, the individuals at the Cosmo are the least helpful/hospitable hotel workers I've met. 

On top of that, the maid of honor spent time linking our rooms and requested we be on the same floor. Individuals who arrived earlier even confirmed they'd be guaranteed despite the late check in. The rooms we received were on 3 separate, floors, 2 different elevator banks. 

Our check in fiasco was probably the only scar on an otherwise fun/pleasant weekend, but it's something I won't forget soon. The room was comfortable and we had a nice view, but frankly, you can find that anywhere. Go somewhere else where they value customer service a bit more.

TLDR: Book a different hotel. Seriously. It'll save you time/headache and I'm sure the front desk individuals will be much more accommodating.",2.0

The carpet had ketchup ground into it and the cushions on the balcony had very obvious ""adult"" bodily fluid stains. I couldn't figure out why there was a dishwasher but no dishes to wash. It seemed like a random thing to add just to have it there. 

The maid service was subpar with the maid knocking on my door three times within one hour after I checked into the room because 1. She forgot shampoo (later I realized she just gave me more shower gel and still no shampoo), 2. She forgot one of my pillows, 3. She wanted to make sure some guy didn't leave his jacket in the room. 

Granted, the room was superficially beautiful and large but past the service it was pretty meh. The casino and hotel itself is gorgeous and a mix of glam and modern.",4.0
"This place is fantastic. They have the whole package - excellent service, food, and atmosphere.

The service is attentive, proficient, prompt, courteous, and graceful. We had exactly what we needed right when we needed it.

The food is delicious - the variety of food they offer is just right and the steaks are perfect. I had the prime rib, which was soaked in au jus. Plain and simple yet perfectly tender and flavorful. The Italian wedding soup is also fantastic.

The atmosphere is wonderful for a romantic dinner. Dimly lit, spotless white tablecloths and server uniforms, brick walls, and no detail unaccounted for.

The teriyaki chicken sauce was like water (very thin).  They sent a couple of spoonfuls of chicken for our lettuce wraps.  If we had sat in we would have at least got a small box full of meat .  The cabbage in the lo mein wasn't cooked properly.  Just an unsatisfactory time, which began with awful customer service.  I guess you have so many customers you can afford to treat them crappy.",1.0
"Firstly, I have an important confession to make. I'm quite a drunkard. So, living in Phoenix, it is quite difficult for me as cab fare can be quite expensive, and cops are ready to pounce on foolish prey like me. So, last weekend, my best friend and I decided to have a weekend of debauchery and book a room at Hotel Indigo. I've heard my friends raving over it, so I said to myself, ""Why not?"" I'm glad that I decided to. 

From the minute I stepped in, I loved the abstract interior. Hotel Indigo isn't conventional, and I loved that. Another thing that I loved is how inexpensive it is, compared to many other hotels. We were fairly close by to the clubs, and if not, cab fare was inexpensive if we wanted to go to a club that is further down in Old Town. The only gripe I had in my room was the AC seemed to not work that well. However, all in all, I had a great experience. 

The breakfast that I added in to our hotel room deal was marvelous. My friend and I had fun talking to the guys behind the counter, and when my friend inquired about the theme behind Hotel Indigo, he explained that the paintings are all symmetrical, abiding by Da Vinci's reccuring theme in his paintings. I actually am considering coming back to eat their food. Yummy. 

I will definitely return to Hotel Indigo when I'm too drunk to drive home to Chandler.",4.0
"I used to like this place but unfortunately India Palace has slowly gone down hill. Waaaay down hill. Plus as I  learned, they have zero loyalty to their customers who eat there fairly regularly. Last night was the last straw. In fact my meal was like chewing straw and inedible. I ordered the Bhindi Masala which is a vegetable okra dish. I have had this several times before but tonight the okra was so tough that if I were to actually swallow it (rather than spit it out in my napkin-sorry gross but true) I guarantee my throat would have been scratched. Also our Roti bread was burned.Not once did anyone check to see how our meals were. When the waitress offered me a box for the uneaten meal at the end , I declined and explained the situation: I have had this dish before but it was like chewing wood shavings (explained it nicer than that) and she just said ok and brought us the bill with no offer to either replace it with another item or take it off the bill like 99.9% of establishments would do. So, they have lost our business and managed  to tick off a yelper over a VERY simple customer service issue.",2.0

Last Saturday was the first time we'd ever been here and honestly we hadn't planned to go there.

"I've seen a few Michael Jackson tribute shows and have been mildly entertained by them and in some cases left my head shaking.  Michael Jackson ONE blows them all away!  After a few mediocre shows on the Strip (BeLIEve, Viva Elvis, Zarkana), this is Cirque du Soliel's comeback to brilliance.

Whether or not you're a fan of Michael Jackson, I'm pretty sure you'll be thoroughly entertained.  It's not like a pure Cirque du Soleil production like KA, Mystere, or O, but it's more in the realm of a tribute show like LOVE was for the Beatles, where the focus is mainly on the music, choreography, and vision inspired my Michael Jackson.

A few highlights of note:

- Make sure you make it to your seat before curtain call so you can get to see some of the pre-show activities.

-The music has been totally remastered in which the instrumentation sounds brand new and follows the dance routines very well.  Like the LOVE theater, the seats have front and rear speakers to totally immerse you into the show.

- The choreography is very well done!  You actually start cheering on the dancers when you see many of MJ's signature moves and routines.

- The stage is pretty awesome with wall-to-wall projections along with some 3D holograms. --  http://bit.ly/1oXQifY

I can go on and on about ONE, but I'd be giving away too much.  Right now, this IS my favorite Vegas CdS show.  It blew my mind!  And it also got me a little misty-eyed simply because this is probably the closest thing I'll ever get to a Michael Jackson live performance.  And like what other Vegas shows like Beatles LOVE and Elton John's Red Piano, it rekindled my interest in Michael Jackson's music and had me listening to his songs weeks later!  I would definitely see ONE again for sure!",5.0
"MJ:One is less traditional circus and more dance to awesome tunes with a few modern flashy stunts thrown in, but still so much fun.

This is not the show for circus purists to see.  If you go in expecting traditional circus, you will be disappointed.  Instead, there is much more of an ""urban"" bent than any of their other shows - slacklining, pole dancing, hip hop dance... oh, and a hologram!  The soundtrack (all MJ of course) has non-stop beats and will have you dancing in your seat!  The story and main characters are cheesy and weak (but CdS stories are never anything to write home about).

The theatre is relatively small, even the cheap seats aren't bad.  Ideal seats wound be towards the back of the front sections (101-103), in the aisle (more on that later).  The seats have their own little speakers on each side of your head, so you're really being immersed into the music.

My favourite number was Thriller (even more awesome if you're in the aisle of the front section) - so much fun!  And Smooth Criminal - watching so many people do the lean all at once was a cool effect!  If you're a MJ fan, this show is a must!",4.0

"I lived there from September 2012 to March 2014. During that time several issues arose. The apartment itself is fine. If there was a maintenance problem, it was handled in a timely manner. There is no water pressure in the shower! Drove me nuts. I would have to take a bath to wash my hair. However, a majority of the tenants left something to be desired. I had someone curse at me because my two small dogs, a cocker spaniel and a mini schnauzer, startled them as I was coming out of my apartment. I mean extremely vulgar profanity. I did report this to the office and they did talk to her. While walking my dogs another time I came upon a altercation between two tenants while in my hearing threats of gun violence were involved. I called the police. Another time, I came home from work and the swat team and Mesa pd were on the scene due to a tenant shooting his firearm into the apartment upstairs barely missing the tenant while he was sleeping in bed and hitting the ceiling fan above him. The suspect refused to come out of his apt and tear gas had to be thrown in his apartment! The stand off lastest for several hours. All over the complex was dog poop. It's seems as though at least half the dogs owners there did not pick up after their dog. The doggie stations only had baggies 50% of the time. They also were only changing the trash bags full of dog feces once a week. I did complain several times to management to no avail. New management did take over at the beginning of 2014, but during the time I was still living there, nothing changed. Also, cigarette butts everywhere! It was disgusting. I also complained of this to no avail. They did send a flyer out telling tenants to not throw their butts out, but no enforcement. There were cigarette butts all around my apt and I don't smoke. The neighbors above me would get done with a cigarette and just throw it to the ground in front of my balcony. I was extremely frustrated living in these conditions. Also, when I left, I got an email explaining why I wasn't getting my deposit back, etc. I called to ask a question because the statement was not itemized so I wasn't sure what cost what. Apparently, even though I left the apartment very clean, even washing the windows going behind the fridge and stove to remove all dirt, vacuuming, made it look really nice. They stated they had to replace the carpeting due to my dogs. That's fine. I accepted that. They took my deposit as well as stating I still owed $95. The manager? Ryan, I believe, was very unprofessional claiming he wasn't the one who sent me the email, that that person was gone, etc. ok, so what? It was his job to answer my questions in a professional manner. I did tell him he was being unprofessional and he did apologize. Overall, I would not recommend this place, not at all.",2.0
"You know, I never understood why Parrotheads get so excited about Jimmy Buffet.  After my first visit to Margaritaville... I still don't understand. I get it, it's a way of life or state of mind, a way to cut loose... but continuous videos of tailgating at Jimmy Buffet shows, with Chesney or Wilson thrown in every 10th video? Not for me. I'm sure a lot of people find this place to be like a little 'cheeseburger in paradise'. The atmosphere is kind of fun, but with a quoted 'one to two hour wait time', at a place that will not do reservations or call-ahead seating, it would be nice to have bigger bars to kill that wait time. The food is not bad. I will say the Volcanic Nachos were like manna from heaven, after we got seated, stacked THIIIIIS high with lots and lots of 'penos. My fish tacos were nothing to write home about, and the side of 'paradise' or something of that nature rice was... rice with carrots and peas. Huh. I have to say, though, I did not feel ripped off. The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping, it was decent. My friends ordered other things and I really did not hear any raving. One person's steak was still mooing, after ordering it medium. 

Service was really, really good. I wish I could do a separate 4 stars for the staff, they were awesome. I never had to ask for another drink, and our guy was incredibly patient while we waited for the rest of our party to show up after we had been seated. We did not feel rushed at all, and that means a lot in such a packed restaurant where others are obviously waiting still. They split our check without batting an eyelash. I tipped accordingly, you should too. These guys were facing a mosh pit with smiles on their faces. The balloon guy on stilts was a hoot (ask him to give you crabs if you go) and the live band was classic college alt rock, about 5 years after college. No one danced, which I thought was pretty funny. They didn't sound too bad. 

Definitely a place for Parrotheads or those into doing the trendy theme restaurant thing. :)",3.0
"Another stop on my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition Tour, I decided to check out Broadway Pizza.  Since I was dining by myself, I opted to order 2 Slices.  Cheese Slices are $1.95 each with $.40 ea for additional toppings.  I ordered 2 Sausage & Pepperoni slices.

After a short wait, the Pizza came out.  The slices were huge....a little bigger than what I normally see around town.  The Pizza is NY Style thin crust.  After a few bites I was underwhelmed.  The Pizza was just OK.  I didn't really care for the Sausage and the Pepperoni didn't have much flavor.

Overall, the Pizza didn't leave me wanting more.  They serve other items like Wings and Calzones....maybe I'll come back to try one of those.

"The restaurant itself gives a very modern yet sophisticated vibe.  The waiters are welcoming and make you feel at home. The biggest downside is the food itself. I ordered the Mongolian crispy noodle which I believe was $16. The only thing from that dish that was appetizing was the shrimp and if you choose to order this then I suggest you ask for the shrimp sauce which ironically isn't for shrimp but pairs well with it. The crispy noodle really is crispy.. as in raw noodles that look like they just came out a packet of ramen. I went with a few friends so I tried a bite here and there and I can honestly say I didn't like anything. The Sriracha sauce is extremely watered down but is somehow spicier than your average Huy Fong. As for the menu itself, the only 'Spanish' food I saw were the tapas which are appetizers. No quesadillas or the basic nachos like I expected there to be. I never thought I would prefer chinese take out than the food from this restaurant. I'm talking about you China Jade. Thankfully, theres a frozen yogurt place next door so you won't go home regretting so many calories on food that tastes like it came out of a box of lean cuisine.",2.0
"I went here last night with my boyfriend to watch Reel Steel (great movie by the way!) As with other reviews, mine is on the AVX theatre. 

I have always like the concept of reserving your seats for a movie. It really takes the stress out of an otherwise very enjoyable afternoon/evening. Or maybe just for me as I am the type of person that needs to be in the theater at least 45 minutes prior to the show to ensure I get the seat I want...as in last, last row right in the middle. (I hate having people behind me because of the talking that inevitably goes on and/or the muddy shoes that I imagine to be a hair's length away...)

Anyways, the AVX takes that stress away, and for a premium (we paid 15.75/ticket) you can choose your seats. Not sure if anyone else experienced this, but my only only beef with the system is that you aren't allowed to choose seats with spaces in between other seats so you inevitably have to sit beside a random person (meaning you can't leave an extra chair between you and the other person). We ended up buying tickets for the last row which someone else had occupied. Because it was not busy, we just sat one row down. Which brings me to my other potential concern - there can always be people in your seats so hang tight to your tickets (for me, I always used to chuck them).

All in all, wouldn't come out of my way to watch the AVX. Seats are no wider but armchairs do lift up so you can cuddle or...

FYI! My boyfriend and I made the mistake of parking at the theater which cost us 20bucks!!! I am sure there are other parking lots around for less, but we were lazy. Not sure if this is the usual rate at this particular lot, or if it was taking advantage of the clubs around. Either way, can't beat the location (right at the theater).",3.0
"Worst experience in a nightclub ever. Was having an ok time, nothing special, until things went crazy over a flask a friend had.  We filed a police report over what security did. They wanted my friend to leave and he agreed, and we decided to leave with him. Security wouldn't let anyone go with them while they took him in the elevator.  It was one unimposing guy surrounded by 4 giant security guards, they pushed him against the elevator wall and made his nose bleed then they choked him until he was unconscious.  They then tried to convince him they found him that way.  My friend pretended to agree with them because he was scared for his safety, but he was not drunk and remembered everything. They had their first aid person clean him up and only let him leave after he pretended to go with their story.  We filed a police report and are looking into legal action.  If security ever takes your friend here, get their names and take their photos. Do not trust them. Do not write this off as drunk belligerence. None of us were drunk, he did not resist them.

"Not the best clubbing experience I've had in Vegas, although I still had a blast. We were guest listed for Benny Benassi on a Friday night, but we ended up not getting there until around 1 am due to traffic. My friend's (fairly high up) promoter hadn't specified a cutoff time for the list, but the bouncers refused to let us in, claiming the list had closed at 11 pm. Even though my friend showed them texts from her promoter saying that we could come in, they wouldn't budge. Finally we just faked our way in by pretending we were with a table. They didn't even check to confirm. So, in summary, rude but stupid bouncers.

As for the actual club, I can't say I remember many details. I think the club was pretty big and had a lot of different areas that I didn't get to explore. I vaguely recall wandering outside onto the patio for a while and chilling by the pool, which was actually really nice. The crowd was just okay... they seemed to be a little older and more ghetto than the crowds I've encountered at other clubs. Benny was awesome, and we stayed until around 5 am when the lights started to go up.

"We stayed for a weekend recently and had a fantastic trip.  The room was beautiful and the bed was seriously the most comfortable I have slept on in my entire life.  We enjoyed having a drink in the lobby bar with live music playing in the background.  We shared a cheese plate appetizer and was NOT impressed.  It was like 3 small slices of cheese for $15 and it wasn't even that great of cheese.  Skip that and stick with a drink.  We thought the conference rooms were nice.  The room service was outstanding.  The caprese salad was AWSOME.  I am still thinking about it.  For breakfast room service brought us the wrong omelet (a ham one instead of a mushroom one) we were promptly brought the correct omelet and ate both for free! :)  We loved laying by the pool in the little beds and having lunch and drinks brought to us poolside.

"This dealership is lacking.  From sales to service to the body shop.  No communication between departments.  General Manager was called twice and we never got a return call.  We've owned our SRX for 3 weeks and I have to say this was our worst car buying experience EVER!  
Had the car into the body shop for a few dents, dings and paint chips and torn driver seat.  They were then supposed to turn the SUV over to service for a few repairs.  Got a call on Friday night to come pick up the vehicle.  Saturday we get there and ask about the service receipt.  The cashier has no knowledge of it being in service and instead of her finding out, she gives me the number to the body shop manager.  Then, while on the phone with him I notice the biggest dent and several paint chips were not taken care of.
He says leave the car and he will take care of it, then get it into service.
So another week goes by, we get a call to come pick up the vehicle.  We get there and upon inspection I notice a couple of things were not completed, the seat was not repaired, the clunk noise is written up as ""could not duplicate"" and while sitting in the vehicle we notice the a/c is not cooling.
So once again, we leave without our vehicle.  Two days later they call, a/c is fixed and a ""new"" radio is installed.
We are headed out of state and will bring the SRX to a different dealership to see if they will do more than tell us they couldn't duplicate the clunk that happens every time you drive.  Don't think it's a normal noise.",1.0
"I am frequent visitor to Guru Lakshmi. I still remember the first time i had Dosas there, it took me back to New Delhi, India. For me that's a good thing because something that reminds of me of back home means ,food is pretty darn good. However since their increasing popularity and now expansion, i feel like that quality/ taste of food is in a declining state . First time i gave them the benefit of the doubt but the second time and third time i didn't get the satisfaction or that feeling when the food ""Hits THAT Spot"". 

Also now i would like to talk about their service, i have never seen any of their staff smile not when they are welcoming guest and not when they greet you at the table to take your order. On our Last visit as soon as we were done with our  food without even asking for a cheque they presented us with a bill, as i am paying for the bill  someone immediately cleaned up the table  while we are still sitting there . I felt it was bit rude but then again there were several people outside waiting for the customers to leave so i understand that.

Overall the food is still miles ahead of any other Dosa place in the GTA area,  but the actually experience of eating at the place needs some improvement.

Thanks",3.0
I called to ask for price quotes.  The guy who answered the phone had an attitude the whole time. I was very friendly and he talks to you like you owe him a favor and sounded like a dik. That alone makes me cringe and will not even go there no matter the price. That's it. I was trying to add zero stars here for that place but the lowest is 1 star,1.0

"LOVE IT! Second time seeing it! With the kids this time :)

Well, after seeing this for the second time, we decided that we liked our higher up in the balcony area seating better last time. (You can see a lot more of the action) :) We LOVE Cirque du Soleil and will be seeking out more of their shows til we see them all! And again too! :)",5.0
"If you're a huge Beatles fan, you will love this show. If you're a huge Cirque du Soleil fan, you might feel a lil' bit disappointed? But I guarantee this, you will definitely appreciate the artistic value of the show and what it's goal was..and that was to pay homage to one of the most influential bands in the history of music. Since I have been a life long Beatles fan, I was very curious as what I should expect? And then my wife literally said, ""Let It Be!"" , and I did...I just relaxed and let go of any expectations from any other show that had seen in the past. Once the music began, I was knocked into the back of my seat.

The audio and visual presentation is awesome. In addition to the theaters dynamic audio system, you have high end audio speakers that are embedded in the headrest of your very comfortable theater chairs, plus the seats that are in front of you have the speakers directed towards you as well!  The main body of the show starts off very solemn,  and as the crescendo builds....it EXPLODES on to the scene with a re-mastered version of ""Get Back"". With performers  dancing and running around the middle of the stage, skaters skating, and acrobats literally falling and flying from the sky.....Whew! 

I was on a high like no other!  My wife was used to listening to the Beatles only through me...strangely enough she quickly became a fan of the Beatles after the show. But I almost think that she was overwhelmed...it was kinda cute, but she kept saying, Hey D, I know that song!  They creators of this show wanted to start this one off with a bang, and they do an OUTSTANDING job of doing it!  You cannot help appreciate the genius not only of Lennon and McCartney, but the FAB FOUR are a part of music history and this was just a way that Cirque du Soleil was able to pay tribute to their contributions to the music, not of their own generation, but all that followed!  Just a fabulous show....so good we decided to take our daughters to this show next spring! I can hardly wait...!",5.0
"A must see show for lovers of music, The Beatles, or Cirque du Soleil!

The show was impressive and the entertainment went on for a long time.  By far, one of the best shows on the strip, and an incredible experience!

Probably not good for the elderly, as it was loud, and there was a lot going on.  For everyone else though, what a great show!

Just like a ride at Disney, there is a gift shop on the way out.",5.0
"I am so glad that we left LOVE as our last big show. I wish I could have been there on stage, dancing my heart and soul out and twirling while soaring higher than the crowd. It's a very inspirational, and moving show. I cried twice! The dancers are just spectacular and the entire production was through the roof! I will most definitely be returning year after year, and maybe one day strive to be a part of the cast. Hmm... Anything can happen right?! COMECOMECOME!!!",5.0
"I was so excited to watch this show, not just because I'm a huge fan of the Beatles but every Cirque show I have seen was amazing. This one, not so much. Maybe it was our seating (balcony) but every angle is supposed to be great and has been in my past experience. I think my main problem with this show is that there was so many ""interpretive dancing"" portions which I felt was blah. And really, what was up with the guy with the flowers? There were some magical moments of the show, don't get me wrong, but if I wanted to watch an interpretive dance music video, I wouldve gotten tickets to the Jabbawockees instead.",2.0
"If you are not a vegetarian, this is the place for you! (Although they can do vegetarian it is still cooked where meat has been cooked.)  I personally didn't eat anything here except for the fries and come condiments, however it is a fantastic place to get a delicious burger exactly how you want it. We took friends here and they were blown away. It looks intimidating because it is a small old building in the heart of downtown Tempe, however it is a landmark and the service and prices are excellent. Parking is $2 across the street at the pay lot which is not bad considering what parking costs elsewhere. Be prepared for a long line out the door because everyone knows this is the go-to place for a hearty delicious burger and fries. The line says it all - they know what they are doing and people are willing to wait. Everything is cooked on an open wood fire grill and worth the time it takes to get your meal.

Just as good or better than the appetizer.  This is not a dish that I would normally order, but I wanted to give it a try.  I am glad that I did because it was just perfection.

I also tried their buffalo wings with celery + ranch for $7.25, which tasted great but could have been better priced.

"The most memorable part of my experience at Mimosa Grill was the house-made pimiento cheese. Served in a ramekin, warm and gooey with crusty bread and celery, the dish was tangy and sumptuous. Even my boyfriend enjoyed it, and he does not like pimiento cheese.

Mimosa Grill has a stunning interior--dark wood with soft lighting and brick accents--reminiscent of a bygone era of three martini lunches, but without any hint of retro kitsch. In that way it's modern, impeccably melding comfort and aesthetics. Mimosa Grill is just as well-suited for Easter brunch as it is for a bachelorette party.

Initially we ordered the daily lunch special, short ribs, but they were out. We were out for a late lunch, around 2 PM, but I still found it strange to run out of the special. The entrees we settled on were a wild mushroom flatbread and a cheeseburger. The flatbread was nice and the mushrooms very fresh, but the flavors were a bit one-note. My boyfriend found his burger overcooked. 

Our server appeared distracted, even though we initially were the only diners. When a group of young women came in they sat them in the booth closest to ours. Considering the restaurant is GINORMOUS, I was frustrated. My boyfriend and I were obviously on a date, and we would have felt that our experience was a priority to Mimosa Grill if the server had simply acknowledged us by valuing our privacy and seating the young women elsewhere.

As one of the ubiquitous high-end Southern restaurants popping up all over Charlotte, and the South in general, Mimosa Grill offers a gorgeous setting. Hopefully the food and service will catch up soon.",3.0

"If you are a tequila lover, this place might be for you.  They have a huge selection of tequilas and can even add some of them as toppers to your margarita.  If you are like me and don't care that much about tequila, it was okay.  For a place that touts their tacos and tequilas, they fell short on the taco side.  I tried the two taco platter with rice and black beans.  My chicken taco was delicious and flavorful, but the steak taco was not as good.  It tasted like they had put the same seasoning on both.  I did try a margarita with a pomegranate tequila topper.  It was strong but tasty.  They also had a salsa bar, but of the four salsa they had there was only one mild option and the rest were super spicy.  The prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly but scarce.

"We are new neighbors just up the hill in Paradise Valley, and we SO wanted this to be our ""go to"" dinner place for nights when we were too busy to cook and to take visiting families and friends.   Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes.",1.0
"Last week we were driving home from work very hungry at 4:30pm and wanted to try somewhere we hadn't been in a while. My fiancé said he used to eat at the Coco's in Chandler frequently before they closed and suggested this. Upon entering the restaurant I had a bad feeling. The interior was severely dated and decked out in hideous shades of orange from the late 70's early 80's. The windows carpet and booths could have all used a good cleaning. We sat down and looked over the menu and decided to keep it simple. My fiance' ordered the Chopped Steak dinner entrée (well done with no pink) and I went with a Prime Rib Mushroom Cheeseburger  (some pink). We received our beverages quickly which was welcomed on a hot day and waited for our food. And waited, and waited...45 minutes later after asking our waitress twice where our meals were she proudly brought them out. It was immediately clear we had made a huge mistake. My burger went back immediately because at first glance it was obvious I had not been served the burger I ordered. No thinly sliced prime rib and no mushrooms. The burger bun was stale and the burger itself was a cold severely overcooked frozen thin hockey puck. I was immediately promised it would be replaced and it was whisked off back to the kitchen. I then looked at my fiancé's Chopped Steak dinner and saw it consisted of the same thin 1/4lb hockey puck also severely overcooked with a scoop of masked potatoes beside it and GRAY Gravy slathered all over it. The waitress had disappeared (never to come to our table again and refill drinks) and four minutes later the manager arrived with my ""correct"" burger. The same burger and fries I was originally served was put in front of me and when I complained he said ""I took it back and had the sliced prime rib and mushrooms added!"" It was still cold, still overcooked, and had lettuce and condiments on it that did not belong! I demanded it go back and be taken off our bill and after seeing my fiancé's dinner opted not to eat at all. When we questioned the manager about the ""Chopped Steak"" he said they had been serving the same 1/4lb hamburger patty as their ""Chopped Steak"" since he began working for the restaurant. He took care of our entire bill and even offered a gift card to have us come back but we declined because if that was their standard fare we certainly were not coming back again. The pie's in the front case looked appetizing but this is not the Coco's food of old and I certainly would not even chance those. There are too many other excellent choices for dinner and dessert at restaurants within a mile.",1.0
"I'll start off saying that this could have easily been a 5 star review.

Everything was good with my initial U-haul experience, until I received my receipt via email. They leave blankets and a dolly in the truck in case you need, but you're not supposed to be charged unless you break the seal and use them. In my case I never used the dolly and definitely did not break the seal. However, it was until afterwards when I received my receipt via email that I saw I was charged for the dolly. I thought, no big deal, I'll just email them and I'm sure they'll correct their mistake. 3 days later, no response. So I called and spoke with the GM and he assured me that every employee always checks the seals and they only charge if they are broken. Most companies when they use a seal have seal numbers to verify every time, but apparently uhaul doesn't.

I guess I should have read other customer review beforehand. And if you do rent from here, make sure you verify everything before you leave.",1.0

Donna Jean had the 2piece chicken and waffles, and we share dessert, banana pudding! This is my fifth time at Lo lo and every time has been exceptional. I highly recommend.",5.0
"My charge nurse recommended this place since I live about 10 minutes away from it and that her family just loves Chicken and Waffles. So I tried going on a Wednesday after my night shift and to my dismay found out they open at 9. I got there at 8:30 and wasn't planning on staying for another 30 minutes since I'm already sleepy. So I gave it another go on Friday.

The place was roomy. It has a bar on the middle which was pretty spacious. Multiple screen TVs where you can get your sports on if you happen to fancy eating waffles and drinking beer at the same time while watching the Olympics. I was seated on a booth (to my surprise) and the place wasn't as busy when I went (which was good). 

I forgot the servers name but he was really nice. He looked like he had a busy morning because even with only two customers he was huffing and puffing. The menu had plenty to offer. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or a combination of the two or three if you wish. I went ahead and ordered Lolo's Chicken and Waffles since well that's what I came for. I saw from reviews that they also liked the Banana Pudding so I ordered that one too.

On to the food. The Waffles were soft, a hint of Cinnamon is there but not overpowering. The butter they served with it was perfect and just made me smile seeing that gold turn to liquid (yeah I'm a fat ***). To my surprise it was the chef that served the food to me! I mean I'm sorry if I put everybody on an inconvenience by going there for lunch. Either that or he was just happy to serve the food he made. But he looked really nervous for some reason. I don't bite. Well not unless your food that is *wink*. So he told me he'd be back with syrup and yes he did. The syrup was warm and went perfectly with the waffles. It was good but I was never really into waffles or had not had too many growing up so there wasn't really anything for me to compare it too. But the taste was just right. There wasn't any after taste or anything that you would usually get if the batter came from a box. And no I'm not saying it came from a box. I'm just saying the ones that come from a box have aftertaste is all. I know very well they make theirs from scratch. Which is a good thing.

The chicken!!! Okay so I'm a big fan of fried chicken. And growing up having been a patron of another restaurant I have a lot to say about Lolo's fried chicken. First of all they are big! As in it looks like they gave me the whole chicken with the three piece I got. All that was missing was the head. The portion is good for someone who's about ready to eat a horse but I believe I ordered too much for my appetite this time around. The skin was crispy but needs a little salting on some parts of the chicken. The taste didn't overpower the waffles and actually went great with them. The meat was tender and became very addicting as I dug through and through. It didn't compare to previous ones that I've had but it paired nicely with the soft waffles they made. But like I said it was just way too much for my appetite this time around and actually had to take some to go (and my fat *** always finishes a plate). That's just how much their servings are.

The banana pudding then comes around and the presentation was really nice. It was served on a Mason Jar with whipped cream on top with tiny butter cookies. It wasn't too sweet and kind of reminds me of bread pudding and was wondering whether the banana is mixed in the pudding or was it just the banana slices that were giving the taste. In my opinion it needed more banana slices. I just had way too much food to start off with so I wasn't able to finish the dessert.

Overall I would say I need a second trip to this place or maybe even a third. But it probably would not be on the top of my list if I have a hankering for Chicken and Waffles. The place has a nice ambience to it and almost feels like a fancy diner where you get to sip wine with your dinner and waffles or drink beer with your breakfast and of course waffles. Waffles, waffles, waffles haha.",3.0
I saw this place while headed to the McDonald's next door. I quickly decided to try this place instead and I'm glad I did. I love the crispy well seasoned fried chicken while my husband loves the stupid fries. The scenery is laid back and the music just right. I might try it again.,3.0

"First time visit..glad we came! Was watching Diners Drive in's and Dives.....so I decided to check the local area to see if they've been anywhere in AZ. Since this was on the list we decided to give it a try. I have the combo meal with the jerk fried rice, black beans, emerald chicken and jade red chicken. It was all very delicious. Do note if you do not like spice the black beans may not be for you because they are a bit on the spicy side, but I thought they were phenomenal! 

I will definitely be back again soon. The emerald chicken was great to try and seems very healthy. I think next time I will try a different item in its place and keep everything else the same...other than I will try the refried beans to see what they bring to the table! The snickerdoodle cookie was a nice treat at the end! 

All in all a great meal for the price you pay. Also, when you walk in you will be filing out a paper slip for your order and hand it to them....we did not know that so we just walked right up to the front...they were very understanding though and did it for us...but just a heads up :)",5.0
"The ability to get mediocre Chinese AND Mexican food at the same time amounts to a whole experience much greater than the sum of its parts. Never has foreign cuisine been bastardized so effectively...but it works.

Think of it as a Panda Express and Taco Bell sharing the same building, only they're totally down to mix up items. You want machaca over fried rice? Sure. Terriyaki chicken quesadilla? Not even a problem. The goal is to satisfy both cravings for $10, and I don't think that can be done anywhere else. 

I prefer to uh...keep my food separated, with a rice bowl and a small quesadilla. ""You could have saved money by making it a combo!"" they said as my food was brought. Too bad no one pointed that out as I handed in the multiple choice test that was my order. I came here to eat, not to fill out paperwork!

Diners rave about the Jade Chicken, and I don't think it's half bad. It's taste is vaguely orange and is a tad on the oily side, and looks and tastes like sweet and sour cut with buffalo sauce...which is weird, but works. Top it off with a bite-sized cheese crisp, a cookie, and perhaps even a reasonably-priced craft beer! 

On your way out, feel free to grab one of the mock Chinese T-Shirts...it's politically correct, but when the rest of the decor looks decades old, I at least appreciate the antiquity of the establishment as a whole. It excels in nothing. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Each item alone is just a-ok. It's the sheer variety and speed of service that forces me to rate it so highly with an extra star.",4.0

"Honestly, the only thing worse than feeling out of place in a bar is feeling downright unwelcome. Not since being the only kid in grade school to own a pair of 10-hole Doc Martens and being sneered at by my preppy, Tretorn-wearing classmates have I felt so...unwanted.

Nevermind the clientele - I knew they'd be pretentious, better dressed, more well-read, and perhaps more educated than me - but I expected more from the staff. It's really a shame because the drinks were OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS, not to mention inventive, and I arrived with money to burn.

The server making the rounds was more interested in appeasing the visibly wealthy than little ol' me and I stood around waiting for someone to hand me a menu for at least ten minutes.

While I may not be an expert in the art of cocktails I am eager to learn more about the beverages I order and was disappointed by the attitude at Barchef.

As mentioned the drinks were outstanding and carefully crafted. I relied on several rounds of ""Van Gogh's Downfall"" ($12) which contained absinthe, orgeat, clove, orange blossom water, anise and lemon rind. I am not a fan of anise OR orgeat (an in-house syrup made of almonds, sugar and rose water) yet somehow this combination worked beautifully. 

Drinks were surprisingly affordable at $8-12 each, with the lone exception being the $45 Manhattan (Crown Royal extra rare, fresh lemon, cherry vanilla bitters made in-house, hickory smoked syrup and vanilla cognac).

Shame about the attitude, really. 2.5 stars.",3.0

"So how about that, I'm updating my review around the exact same time I wrote it last year! I still standby Lincoln Tap House being A-OK if you're in Tower City and need a sit down place, but just keep your expectations realistic if you're wanting a 5-star dining experience.

Gosh, I hate saying it, but the staff often seem overwhelmed and understaffed, regardless of how busy it is or isn't. The host is very awkward. He will see you, but walk away, and you're not sure if he's coming back. There's a mutual feeling of this throughout all the tables... guests anxiously looking for someone to take their check, looking for a server, etc. We usually just end up asking whomever we see if someone can take our order, and whenever we get the bill, we typically pay it right then-- you never know when you'll see someone again. Our table was quite sticky and for a weeknight, I was surprised how dirty the floors were. So, not much to ambience.

I still standby that LTH does decent catering, so I am not sure where the disconnect is with the restaurant. As I mentioned previously, come for a beer, grab an appetizer, and enjoy watching the Cavs. The burgers are a safe bet here, which I think is their stronger suit.",3.0
"I came here with my fiance a few weeks ago to celebrate our engagement. I had wanted to try Joel Robuchon next door, however it was closed for renovations during our stay so I opted for L'Atelier instead. It may not have been the best choice for our occasion but we have plenty of intimate fine dining meals, it was nice to change things up.  

I really liked the counter service concept. I've eaten at plenty of counters and watched my food being made; but never food of such a high quality. It was great to see the chefs tediously preparing each course as we were eating the one prior to it. The kitchen's timing was impeccable! After a few courses I could tell when they were preparing our next course by how far along we were on the current dish. This was all done with seemingly clockwork precision. No running around or yelling in this kitchen.

We both had the $155 Seasonal Discovery Menu.

The amuse bouche of avocado and cilantro flavored grapefruit gelee and the turbot filet and baby leeks, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger were real standouts for me' as was the la framboise dessert.

Not-so-hot was the heirloom tomato salad with basil oil and fleur de sel. It was good, but far from spectacular, it seemed like a filler. The foie gras quail was OK but neither of us could taste more than a slight hint of foie gras.

Overall a very good meal. So why four stars instead of five? The price and the portion size. While it was a great meal, I don't think that the portions we were served and the level of service (by design of the counter seating, not at all to the fault of the servers, they were fantastic!) warranted the $155 price tag.",4.0
"This is a very special dining experience!  I highly recommend sitting at the counter surrounding the kitchen (this is the majority of the seats except for larger tables) and watching the food preparation. Your server takes unique care of you from beginning to end. 

We did the tasting menu and wine pairings (which were very generous pours!).  They even custom prepared some menu items for me to avoid dairy.  Everything was so delicate, delicious, and rich in flavor.  We also added an order of the shaved Iberico ham which was amazing.

Get your wallet ready or head over after a big win at the tables, but it's well worth it!",5.0
"Delicious Mexican food in Mesa!  I've been here a couple times and have always liked what I ordered.  My favorite dish is the Killer burrito, enchilada style (green sauce).  I like that you order and pay at the counter and then find a seat and they deliver the food.  The service is pretty quick even when they get busy during lunch and dinner times.  They are within walking distance of the Mesa Arts Center.  You can easily park at the MAC, walk to dinner, and then walk back for a show.  The only negative is that they only accept cash, so make note of that before you go!",5.0
"This location can't compare to the one at midland and ncnicoll in scarborough.  It feels like your eating in a large hall with rows of seating and no sections.

"LOVE ME SOME KOHREAN BBQz!!!! This place is my #2 favorite (after Kazan). Last time I came it was around 7pm on a Friday and we had to wait 10-ish minutes for a table. Even though they had a whole empty row.... :S oh well, it's worth it. MAKE A REZZIE!

The major difference with Chako compared to other places I've been to is that they have salads, hand rolls, other snacks on the menu. It's really useful while you wait for the meat to cook.

They also have Ox tongue - yum yum yummmmm, and special steak and other meats last time I went. They didn't change the grill at all which was disappointing because it gets dirty pretty fast. Kazan changes the grill every 5 minutes (no joke).

Meat, fish, etc is served in small square containers not on a big platter like Kazan (yeah, I compare every K-BBQ place to Kazan SO WHAT). I found that last time the food took way longer to cook than usual, I ended up eating like 5 order of sushi before I got my first piece of ox tongue down by gob. Sigh...

I think this place is great for groups, birthday parties, first dates with cute chubby girls (take me take me!!) - you name it!! 

They also have these barrel things which are thing are full of soju...I hate soju but every time I come I see one on every other table so they are popular!",4.0

"Wish I could give zero stars!
We went to Longhorn Steakhouse last night for my son's 15th birthday.  He has been wanting to go there since it opened.  We were all excited to try it.  Unfortunately we didn't get to.  When we were seated my daughter noticed that one of the small plates we had just been given by the hostess was dirty...really dirty.  Upon further inspection we saw that all 5 plates that we were given upon being seated were dirty"". They were really dirty and one even looked like it had two small bugs on it.  Yuck!   We have owned a restaurant, so understand that sometimes things happen and a plate might not get completely clean, but all 5?  That's a big indication as to the cleanliness of the kitchen and if the dishes aren't clean what else isn't.  Needless to say, we didn't stay.  We didn't care how ""good"" the food was going to taste out of the peri dirty kitchen.  We went to Outback Steakhouse ( which was also a first for us) and it was delicious!  Happy birthday, Son""",1.0
"I hope guu is way better than this. anyone who is willing to wait 2 hours to eat anything even close to this is in for a disappointment.

I ordered the niku udon (the standard beef one) and the octopus appetizer everyone raves about. The beef in the soup was rubbery. broth lackluster. nothing special. The octopus appetizer is kinda gross. deep fried with some japanese mayo thats a tad too zippy. not worth waiting the 20 minute prep time.

One of my friends had the curry udon and said it was really good, so maybe thats worth trying.

I will say, pretty cheap (most soups run around $5-6) and you get plenty.",2.0
"Stopped in here for lunch after a morning hike. They have a good selection of both hot & cold sandwiches and various salads to satisfy just about any appetite. The guy who helped us (I wish I remembered to catch his name) was outgoing, friendly & seemed genuinely interested in making sure we enjoyed our food. We got the impression he was probably the owner. 

I had the Reuben (hot) and it was tasty & prepared to my liking. My hiking partner had their ""Stacked"" (cold) sandwich and said it was satisfying as well. My only suggestion would be to add another side choice besides chips or potato salad (like macaroni salad ). Otherwise, when I'm on that side of town and want a quick sandwich lunch, I'll be sure to return.",5.0

"I think people that end up writing bad reviews (just look at Google for a bunch of complaints against this store) expect everyone they encounter to be a certain way. Just because someone doesn't have a personality you deem to be acceptable doesn't mean a store deserves poor ratings. 

My husband and I went in last night to inquire about getting his belt sewed, a watch battery replaced, and have some links taken out of his watch strap. 

The man who works here is clearly a hands-on person, very focused on his job and not really looking to have a conversation. I'm a chatty person, I tried a few times but he wasn't very responsive. Is that a bad thing? No. I cannot expect everyone I meet to be talkative like I am. 

The prices he quoted were exceptionally reasonable for what we wanted done (in total we paid $40 for everything. The last place my husband took his watch to have his battery replaced charged $30 to replace a battery (we'd have done it ourselves but the watch isn't the easiest to get to the back of) and they made us wait a few days until it was ready to be picked up. Minute Keys did all 3 things in HALF AN HOUR!!! He was also kind enough to say that if my husband wasn't happy with the watch band and wanted a few more links taken out to come back and he would do it free of charge.

Simple and to the point, no bells and whistles. Stop expecting so much from a store. This man does his job and does it well, and I have no qualms about the man behind the counter being quiet. Remember folks, everyone has their own story and their own personality. If a job is done right, the rest shouldn't matter.",5.0
"I love Mix! Such a great alternative to clubbing. My friends and I weren't too excited about getting in the ten mile long line for light, so we chose to come here instead. This lounge has its own elevator access at TheHotel and if you're afraid of heights, you're pretty much screwed because you can see everything through the glass elevator. But the view is outstanding!

It wasn't too crowded, easy to order drinks and the DJ was playing a good mix. We were able to grab a booth next to a group of cutie Asian girls, so there's alot of eye candy here. But the best thing about this place is the view! You cannot beat it.

Can't wait to go back!",5.0
"I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking, but this place was a horrible.  All style, no substance.  If price were not taken into account, I would give this place slightly below 3 stars for the quality of food.  But for the thermospheric prices ($50/entree), I had expected excellent, if not indelibly memorable food.  Instead, the food was just adequate.  So I knocked off 2 stars because of the poor price/quality ratio.

Not everything about this place was bad.  The dining room was very nicely done.  It definitely had the trendy Vegas/LA see/be seen thing going on.  The waiters were also very helpful.  Ours knew the intricacies of every dish and spoke like a food critic, using words like ""acidity"" and ""overtones"".  We got excited just listening to him talk about the dishes.

But then the food came.  The first course was actually decent.  I ordered the prawns appetizer, which had excellent crustacean flavor, but not quite worth the $28.  My girlfriend had the gnocchi, which was good, but again, not spectacular.  For the entree, I ordered the bison.  Again, a decent piece of meat, but nothing memorable.  The peppercorn crust was far too heavy, which made me think that the chef was trying to mask the dull flavor of the underlying meat.  My girlfriend had the lobster au curry ($58), which is supposedly one of Alain Ducasse's signature dishes.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, but the sauce did nothing to enhance the flavor of the lobster, which left the dish tasting limp.  

While we were pretending to enjoy our entrees, the waiter came by to remind us that both were written up in magazines (Bon Apetit I think he said).  As if suggestion was going to make the entrees taste better.  Had the dishes verged on greatness, we might have been convinced.  But that was clearly not the case.",1.0
"First off, I created a yelp account just so that I could write this review. Let me begin by saying that I do not complain. I'm generally very complacent, easily impressed and overall try to see the best in every situation. But this? This was absolutely ridiculous.

I too used the groupon coupon for desperate house maids. Never. Ever. Ever again will I be using their services. After three phone calls I was finally given a tentative date in which I could redeem my cleaning services - a month from the day that I called. I was told that due to a heavy volume and huge response from the groupon site, that was the best they could do. Fine. I was told that if I didn't hear from them, they would be there on such and such date. That date came and went. I didn't hear from them, and nobody showed up (I should mention I had to take half a personal day from work as I wasn't comfortable with them in my place alone for the first time and they do not work evenings, early mornings or weekends - and nobody showed up).
I called back (unsucessfully). After three messages, and a week gone by, someone got back to me. They apologized for the mistake and said the appointment was never officially scheduled, but they could come in two weeks. Again, the best they could do.
They showed up a week early, without warning, as I was on my way out the door. I had not prepared, tidied etc... but fine. They were there, finally, so I was happy. Luckily my boyfriend happened to have the day off, and could be there to ensure that everything went smoothly.
After about an hour, they attempted to leave. My boyfriend pointed out that we had paid for two hours, and that they hadn't even vacuumed yet. They agreed to stay a little bit longer, but stated that their vacuum had broken the night before. At this point he put up a bit of a fuss and questioned how you could have a cleaning service without having a vacuum. They apologized and agreed to come back the next day to finish up the job and vacuum.
The next day they did not show up.
After calling, they apologized yet again claiming that ""something came up"" and said they would come back and finish the job that they had started two days earlier. They came (an hour late), stayed for no longer than 5 minutes, and took off again. 
Never. Ever. Ever again will I be using their services.

Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The chicken is not grilled it's more like boiled soft. True teriyaki chicken is supposed to be grilled.

"It was destiny that led me to this supermarket. Let me start by saying, i was looking for a yogurt starter online. I used to order online in the past but i needed one asap, so i googled the brand and one of the stores that carry it was Yummy Market. I went and to my surprise, found my dream grocery store. (If there's a thing as such) 
First, its has a cafe serving Illy coffee. I used to appreciate longos with a starbucks inside the store, and the  that has a cup holder. Here at Yummy, is an actual sit down cafe that serves fresh pastries, espresso, tea and gelato. Why would i not want to be there at 8am on a cold winter day? The americano is calling my name. So ever since I've discovered this gem, it became a ritual for me to get up early and grab a cuppa joe and relax before i shop.
Second, the wall to wall cheese and smoked meats section is the bomb. I've never seen so many options for cheese and meats. 
Third, their produce are fresh and good quality and are not overpriced. They even have black radish! 
Fourth, the meats are of good quality, from chicken to pork and beef.
Fifth, the smoked fish and the pickled veggies. 
Sixth, tons of chocolate choices.
Seventh, fresh breads baked in house
Eight, plain old good customer service. When you ask one staff for help, they actually stop what they're doing and walk you to the correct aisle. 
I guess fate had it for me to find Yummy",4.0

"Everyone here complains about the price...and yes, your going to get a little sticker shock for what looks like a mall food court.  However, this is not Panda Express, and you will not need your Chipotleaway for this meal.  It's the MGM, the nations largest hotel and tourist trap and my meal here (with double chicken and noodles) still comes in for about $19.  I've been charged more for breakfast at the MGM Diner.  

Just take a look at your other options...you've got $5 slices of bad pizza, or you can dare to eat McD's or Nathans.  The bowl of ice cream at Haagen Dazs will likely do less damage to your body over those two fast food giants.

Back to Asian Fresh...lots of fresh veggies you pick out, quality chicken breast, and who doesn't like Stir Fry?  Filing and good, and plenty of selection with various meats, veggies, and other add ins available.  A nice spicy Kung Pao sauce too.

They do need to add some Brown Rice into the mix.  How that continues to get overlooked year after year still surprises me.",4.0

"I came here the friday after Christmas with an intimate group of friends, and I was absolutely smitten with the place. The owners were fantastic, the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. 

The food was impecable, the drinks were great and basically personalized to taste. We all sent our drinks and food around the table a couple times. We enjoyed the 3 way bruschetta (you can't go wrong with any, as long as you love cheese!),  portebello and balsalmic pizzette, ,pesto and shrimp pizzette, the lobster mac and cheese, and the rabbit ravioli. Dessert included cherry bourboun icecream/smoked porter float, and the chocolate bread pudding. Drinks were many, and merry. The deconstructed coffee was a table favorite though, I highly recommend it! An A++ place, and I bet with happy hour, it's not even worth going anywhere else! It's really nice to enjoy a chef owned restaurant in a part of town that is riddled with corporate establishments.

The food is excellent
My mouth is full
I saw a wine list
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me as I ordered
She had many patrons at hand
But they won't lose me as a customer 
Cause I'm a big fan

Nosh Arizona, Nosh Arizona
Nosh Arizona, it's cool
I saw your place in a magazine space
And I thought I'd go to you
Cause I'll always be coming back to you

Nosh=to eat food enthusiastically or greedily.  Indeed, I'm guilty of this heinous deed!  However, I have to say I was damn hungry!  I came with a gal pal and we sat at the kitchen bar.  Nosh is definitely a cute setting and relaxing atmosphere.  Located in Chandler it's a rare find!  

We ordered...well I should say I ordered the Apple Gorgonzola pizza to share or not!  Needless to say scarfed it down!  The sweetness of the cheeses meshed well with the saltiness of the maple bacon while the hint of bitterness came from the arugula.  Yummy yummy yummy indeed!

"I heard this was a place where you could get Middle Eastern Cuisine, so I thought I would give it a try. I love Lebanese food and I have not found a place on the West Coast that knows how to make shawarma. I was hoping this place did...nope. First of all you need to have the machine to rotate and cook the lamb. The meat does not taste the same on the grill. Then you need to have a panini grill to toast the sandwich after you roll it up. I still have to go back to Dearborn, Michigan to get a good shawarma sandwich.

That being said, I will say they have a cool little hookah lounge. They have nice drink menu and food menu as well. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. I just want a real shawarma sandwich!! I think the owners are Israeli, so that would explain the different style of some of the cooking. They make shawarma sandwiches way different. The food is going to vary from country to country in the Middle East, but it's all basically the same stuff.

Anyways, the place looked clean and the food is good. I would recommend trying it out.",4.0
"This is a great place if you're a hearty eater. They give you tons of (average tasting) food at a very reasonable price. For about 8 dollars a person, you can eat as much as your heart desires. The food came out of the kitchen pretty quick too, as per many Chinese restaurants.

But I should warn you that it's extremely loud in here. You won't be able to carry a conversation with whomever you're dining with. Also, like many Chinese restaurants, the service is on the bad side. Getting a new jug of tea took about 10 minutes for the staff.

PRO: $35 mani pedi. Vicki was great! My nails came out terrific and she was friendly. She even fixed my toe when I messed it up. 

CONS: the massage chairs are not fit for small people. They didn't explain how to use it. I just pressed buttons. They do offer drinks but they don't have a drink menu or tell you the prices. I could pay for a wine or soda, but just the option to know your prices. Same with the manicure and pedicure - no price menu. They just told us the prices. The nail bar was crowded and some of the chairs did not work. I've never been to a nail salon so busy before. I would recommend making an appointment. I'm not sure if these people are returning customers or first time customers. Our manicurists didn't even say goodbye to us. They just moved on to the next customer.",2.0

I have been on the hunt for legitimate south indian food since I have moved here and this is the first time I've tasted anything close to it. I am so excited even writing about it and thinking of the smell of all of those spices. I ordered the Madras Goat and it was delicious.

"My buddy Wes has been raving about this place for a while.  I've never been a huge snowcone person so I didn't really see the big deal.  On the way home from a Beerfest we ended up stopping and I couldn't believe the line.  Not only was there a line but there were multiple couples that were dressed up for Prom.  And they were stopped at a snowcone shack?  Yes, they were!

This place is no joke and was one of the best, if not the best, snowcones I've ever had.  I can't quite remember the combination of flavors I got (see beerfest) but I know that the Tiger's Blood was in there somewhere.  There was just something about the flavor and the cream they used that made this snowcone amazing!  I'm glad I finally stopped in and even happier that I live less than 5 minutes away.",4.0

"You get 90 minutes to eat as much sushi and other types types of Asian foods. The sushi you get to eat is SOOO fresh and made with lots of love.

"I can understand a lot of the reviews here. As far as my experience is concerned, I think 3 stars is fair. But, I'm leaning more towards 2.5 stars.

This place used to be the old sushi Kaizen. Never been to that one so I would have nothing to compare it too.

Came here with a pretty large group, and suffice to say, the service was excellent. The server did a great job taking the orders and made sure that each person got the correct dish, even while she was taking care of other tables as well. I also liked how we were able to order from the runners and bussers when she was busy.

Food wise, everything was mediocre to OK. One thing I had to mention was that the rice wasn't really good, it tasted like it had been refrigerated or undercooked. It was weird. The fish quality tasted average at best. As many of people have mentioned, they make the rolls and nigiri pretty fast here, but presentation isn't really their strong suit. And, they are pretty heavy handed with the sauces. I did like the chicken katsu roll, something that I have never had before. But, don't be fooled by the miso or tonkatsu ramen that is on the menu. It isn't late night Goyemon's. I ordered the miso ramen and it was their regular miso soup with instant ramen noodles LOL.

I definitely like trying new AYCE sushi spots. But at this place, I would have to probably have to put it in my mid to lower range spots.",3.0

Honestly, I wanted to love Burger Bar.  I just... didn't.

I came with my co-workers for a birthday celebration. We had the choice of either the buffet or menu options. The buffet comes with your choice of salad, choice of two meats, veggies and desserts. The menu options included salads, wings and sandwiches. 

I went with the Cobb salad. It came with blue cheese, crumbled bacon, egg, tomatoes, avocado and chicken with blue cheese dressing. 

When it arrived I was blown away by the size. That thing was huge! I was very impressed that they were not skimpy with the toppings either! They piled on all my favorites and the homemade blue cheese dressing brought it all together!

I can see this being in my regular lunch rotation especially since there are several other salads I'm looking forward to trying...and let's not forget about giving that buffet a try!",4.0
"Went here due to the mailer we received for BOGO. We ordered the Jack Daniels ribs, steak and shrimp, and wings to start us off. The food was good and the service was acceptable. Nothing really stood out as excellent, and I don't see us returning anytime soon. I would agree with Scott that the service is at times ""lacking"", but we didn't choke on any steak so I think somewhere between 2-3 stars is right.",3.0
"Wow, incredible service, fantastic food and great ambiance.  We had Spinach Gnocchi, Carpaccio, Calamari and New York Strip all exceeded expectations.

"So excited to have found this place! As we geared up to renovate one bathroom, we were amazed at how affordable we could get vanities, pre-cut granite, sinks, faucets, toilets, etc!

"The hostess had an attitude...but our waiter was great. The food was pricey but amazing and the views are phenomenal..unlike anything in Vegas! The elevator view going up was worth the prices alone. Totally worth going, especially if you're staying at the Rio (we were).. the French onion soup was delicious & my friends loved the rib eye.. I would definitely recommend it!",5.0
"The View is amazing, and adds a romantic ambiance to the overall dinning experience. Our servers were very attentive without hovering, we got a bottle of wine, which they kept chilled at the bar for us. We got the lump crab & artichoke dip, which was delicious, and a very ample portion, so much so I opted for a salad and soup for dinner (pathetic I know while at a steak house, but the boyfriend let me try some of his steak). The wedge salad was pretty standard, good dressing, but had 2 pieces of almost whole bacon, not crumbled. The French onion soup was fabulous, cheese was nice and crispy on top, and a good amount of onions. The boyfriend got the Ribeye, perfectly cooked to medium, and nice grill marks and a juicy center. We will be back.",4.0
"Came here with the family after the UFC fight on a Saturday night late (!!), luckily this was the type of place bypasses by most of the UFC crowd.  Somewhat randomly chosen but a nice find: sticks right out into the center of the MGM so you feel the open space.  The menu was a mix of comfort food and creative experiments: fun for the foodie and the grubby eater.  I was drawn to the most unusual combination of the burger with peanut butter, bacon jam, and potato chips, which proved to be less obnoxious than it sounds--the taste combo was fairly subtle and unified without too much of the extra ingredients and a nice crunchy, toasty, burnt taste that wasn't too overwhelming.   Great service (except forgetting one person's dish entirely---but then we got it fast and for free).",4.0
You must order Brisket benedict!! Always makes us happy after a good tasting meal.  Their brunch menu Lobster corndog was amazingly soft and moist. This place never disappoints us. Their coffee was even good. Will definitely be back again next time we r in Vegas.,5.0
My husband and I decided to try this place for our Christmas dinner considering its holidays with short staff we waited for over an hour ( no reservations) but we are so disappointed about this place.  it's a butcher/ restaurant style and they sell raw nice looking tomahawk rib eye steaks etc but it is definitely NOT a Steakhouse :(  they serve their steaks like those midnight deals for $7.99 steak and eggs in Vegas it's was 1/2 thick and was serve well done when we asked for medium .... Don't come here if you are looking for a nice thick juicy steak,2.0
"Have been waiting for the Hook and Hoof to open for months now and we finally got to go last night.  What a treat and welcome addition to Lake County dining.  We sat at the Chef's window and enjoyed watching the kitchen preparations.  It also allows you to see the food before you place your order and we really loved that.  The star for us was the appetizer, smoked clams and mussels in coconut milk broth.  I do not normally eat clams, but these were so tender and flavorful, I could not get enough of them.  
I also had the fish chowder and creamed kale which were also very tasty.  My husband had the pork chop and he raved about that dish as well.

Our server was very nice and helpful when asked questions.  My only complaint was I requested my soup and side to come out when my husband's entree was served, but it came out about 15 minutes before. When the pork chop did come out, I asked for it to be reheated.  They took it back and prepared a new one totally.  (Being at the chef's window, I saw it being done). Kudos for that.The kitchen was a bit backed up but being in the first month of opening, this is understood. We got to meet Hunter and Chaz, the co-owners, who were very interested in how things went. 
We will definitely be back soon and look forward to trying more dishes. I do not eat beef or pork, so I am very happy that there are several seafood choices and well as vegetarian options.",5.0
"So let's chat.  There's a really great ambiance to his place and overall, they delivered on what they look like.  Gorgeous people served me good food and beer, and all is well with the world.

So let's get into the details of the service:

1.  Friendly greeting at the door,  but slowish attentiveness once seated.  A couple of bad taps later, and it was 20 minutes before I had a drink in hand.

2.  Chicken sandwich was excellent, very fresh.  More Siracha would have given this sandwich the kick it needed.

3.  Really healthy vibe in the room,  but quiet enough to hear friends around me.  They've got the atmosphere down.

4.  The torte wasn't a torte.  It's a cake, not remotely a torte.  Lots of whipped cream and unnecessary crap on the plate (cherry on top, really?) but the waitress was honest about the source of it (they import their dessert).  Not thrilling to experience.

Overall, I like the place.  It's a tap house, and meets what I expect from the name.  Let's tighten down some details and aim for five stars.",4.0
"I'm not big on buffets and have never been to the same one twice. Especially in or near Vegas since there is a large variety to choose from and for the most part, if you've seen one, you've seen them all. However, the buffet at the M Resort is different, and you'll want to go back! 

The food appears and has a better taste of quality compared to other buffets I've tried. In addition, they have a larger selection of creative dishes, of many types of cuisines, rather than the just the standards you'd expect to see (although they do have those too). All impressive to me considering the amount of food they turn out each day. 

I'm a vegetarian so never really feel as if I get my money's worth going to buffets but I was completely satisfied here... I actually overdid it! Check it out!",5.0
"Rather short line but long wait, busy place.

I just search for buffet restaurants inn Las Vegas and Studio B did not show up.  So I did the search for Henderson, NV (the actual location) and it still didn't display.  Whatever.

We got there at 6pm on the Tuesday after the Memorial Day holiday.  The non-priority queue was just two segments of the maze but it took 45 minutes until we were seated.  I'm not an experienced L.V. buffet goer, but this seemed nearly intolerably slow.  It would have probably been less than 10 minutes in the priority line.

Their system for seating people seemed very primitive/inefficient.  There were a few vacant tables and a computerized table tracking/management system would have helped make the line move more quickly.  Such a system must exist.  It should be less complex than the systems used by waiters submit orders and produce checks in restaurants with menus.  We were passing through and fortunately had six hours before our flight out.

The food mostly seemed to be of good quality and fresh.  If you think something isn't so great, there is so much else to choose from.  I especially liked the ox tail soup.  It is a bit of work.  The meat is still attached to the bone.  I suggest putting the meat on a plate to remove the morsels of meat from the bone and then putting the meat back into the delicious broth.

I almost never give much credence to dessert offerings.  But, I make a big exception here.  I was planning on my normal fresh fruit for a light dessert.  Then I walked by the very long dessert buffet.  It wasn't just the huge selection, but that most were served in quite small portions.  You could sample a half dozen different things without feeling like a glutton and over stuffing your stomach.  Still you need a modicum of restraint not to over indulge.  I like variety with quality in a buffet and don't go for quantity as many do.

The free beer, wine, and hard cider make this probably the best value in town.  The wholesale price of wine and beer doesn't mean that it costs them a lot but it is quite a savings over normal highly inflated by the glass or bottle in a restaurant price.  The retail price of the wine they serve usually sells for about $12 for a 1.5 liter bottle.  The red wine was quite drinkable.  I didn't try the white wine because it is chardonnay and I don't like the excessive woodyness of most domestic chardonnays.  

The location was fine for us since we were just passing through and I didn't want to have to deal with a possible traffic jam around the Strip.

Overall though, my memory from six years ago at Le Village Buffet in Paris, Las Vegas is more favorable.  Not considering the difference in food, I don't remember the noise level at Le Village to be as high as that at Studio B.  Some may like the ""high energy"" of Studio B but it almost seemed like a relief when we left the restaurant and walked onto the casino floor!  Probably would chance Le Village when years later I'm in or passing through Vegas.  I just find the incessant audio and visual assault on my senses to be very unpleasant.",4.0
"My favorite buffet in Las Vegas (although it is in Henderson)!  The crab legs are delicious, the variety is fantastic, deserts are pretty tasty, and the staff is super friendly!

My husband and I would go at least once a month and told all our friends about it.  We tried other buffets, including the boasted Rio, but none of them were as good as the M.

The wait can be a bit much so try to get there early!",5.0
"For the price, it's good. The food is ok, the sushi is so bad though. The rice is so hard and chewy. Bleh...I do like the Ox Tail soup, the chicken and beef sliders, and prime rib are ok. 
We keep coming back because it's relatively cheaper than the high end buffets on the strip. We also like to stop by before we check in to our hotel. 
It's easy to get in and out of this place, the line isn't so long, and the parking isn't so bad.",3.0
"Extremely Disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the buffet was decent. But I went in there expecting it to be on Par/better with/than the Wynn and it definitely wasn't. The Prime rib was rough, dry and tasteless. They didn't have Alaskan king crab, Most of the food was dry and just seemed to be whipped up fast with no love at all. The only foods i enjoyed and got seconds of were the BBQ ribs, pastas, and chicken in spinach sauce (whatever its called). The gelato was alright, nothing special (chocolate mint was the one i liked) 

Wouldn't drive 20 mins to get to this place again unless some how they comp me without me gambling there ;)",3.0

I highly recommend the place if you are in the area and want to have a few drinks, and eat lots of delicious pizza and wings.",5.0
"Went once for the $39 intro massage deal they had. It felt like an assembly line. The therapist must have been straight out of massage school and seemed unsure as to what she was doing. The therapist tended to use deep pressure over nerves and too light of a touch over the muscles. I tried to give her feedback when she was too deep or too shallow, but this just seemed to confuse her.
I have had way more effective massages at massage schools (such as SWIHA or Spa Pima) than the one I received here and at a lower cost than this intro one time rate. They try and talk you into buying a membership. Parking is very tight with surrounding business competing for too few parking spaces.",2.0
"As a big time procrastinator of scheduling doctor's appointments, I had not been to the dentist in quite some time, until recently. My past experiences taught me to strongly dislike and even fear the dentist, but that has all been wiped away with my first visit to Dr. Rosenblitt's office.

I work next door to the Leader building, so I looked on Yelp for dentists in the area. Upon seeing such positive reviews of Dr. Rosenblitt's office, I was sold.

I had a good experience for a few reasons. First of all, it was very easy to get an appointment. I called and a couple days later went in. After my appointment, the receptionist also scheduled me for my next six-month cleaning. Second, the hygienist, Mark, was very personable, kind and helpful. We spent a lot of time chatting as he took some X-rays and cleaned my teeth. He was very careful and offered helpful advice. Finally, Dr. Rosenblitt was also very nice and attentive. He made sure to connect and gave me the opportunity to ask questions, which I appreciated. I felt heard and taken care of, which can be rare in the medical world.

Overall, a very positive experience - and I would never have expected to say that about the dentist! I will highly recommend Dr. Rosenblitt's office to anyone looking for a new dentist.",5.0

"The staff seem friendly which is all good and well but the actual service there leaves much to be desired. 

I booked my bike in for a service and as others have mentioned it takes a while before your bike can be serviced which is fine - if they tell you you have to wait and you're willing to then it's all good. BUT when it came to the actual day for me to pick up my bike they said that they were going to ring when it was ready - so I waited but no one rang. I went to see them the next day and they were like ""it's not been started on, we had a really busy day yesterday"". So what really p***ed me off was the fact that they scheduled me one week in advance, had my bike for two whole days (I gave them my bike on the morning of the previous day) and still weren't able to schedule their mechanic's time in order to get me my bike when they said that they were going to and didn't have the courtesy to give me a call to tell me that it was going to be late! If you've scheduled something so far in advance you should be able to deliver. If you're not going to be able to deliver the least you could do is give me a call to tell me that it's going to be late!

After I got my bike back there were also other issues. The brakes weren't aligned properly and so there was quite a bit of chaffing. I had my crankset changed because I had complained that the gears weren't changing as crisply as used to and while they did replace my crankset they didn't re-align my derailer properly so there was a lot of ""clicking"" noises. It was almost as if because they were so busy, they'd rushed the job, still completed it late and botched it up. If you're going to complete a job late the least you can do is to complete it well!",2.0
"Sunday night we decided to have dinner with a couple friends at STK located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. Let me tell you, it was probably the strangest dinner I have ever been to. I felt like I was in some type of music video or commercial. The patrons and servers were so over saturated with enthusiasm that there had to be a director near by yelling ""action"" from the top of his lungs! I mean, he had to yell because you couldn't hear your own thoughts over the music the DJ had streaming over every table and like clockwork he had an ultra-annoying horn blow ever few minutes. As if that were not enough, every few seconds there was a voice reminding us that the guy controlling the sounds was a ""world-class DJ."" There were girls fist-pumping, servers dancing while pouring wine, and people grinding between tables. I think I actually rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not dreaming! I grew up in Vegas, by way of the military (my dad was in the Air Force). I don't know if Las Vegas has always been like this or I can now see how semi-cheesy it is... Whatever the case, people were having fun and that was nice. More pics on my blog",3.0
I am not even a fan of meat and I love this place!  I would say a bit more upscale from the Gordon Ramsay's but I really can't say one is better than the other.

Well, they finally opened.  I'm hoping they're just getting over some new location issues but it's been a few weeks now and today they've stumbled more than ever before.  Placing orders takes longer than usual their credit card machines move slower than they did in the 90's.  The last time we were there my husband got a pickle and it was covered in white ""goop"", if you will.  Picture it.  Needless to say, my husband didn't eat it.  Today I used their app to place an order on my way home from work.  I got there to pick it up but because everything was running so slow despite there being just one family in there when I arrived, it took just as long so placing the order in advance saved me absolutely no time.  Hopefully as things move along they get more in their game.",3.0

The meal was great, the setting very comfortable, and the staff from the front ot the house to the back, top notch!",5.0
"Caveat: I don't drink coffee (gasp!) so I'll be commenting on every aspect but that. Read other reviews if you want to know how the coffee is.

The biggest selling point of this place is that it's open late. Yes it has free wifi, but forgive me for being underwhelmed, considering that pretty much every coffee shop that doesn't have a green logo does. Even then, their obnoxious password system resulted in problems getting the wifi working on my iPhone.
The indoor seating arrangement is odd, which has left me feeling uncomfortable if I don't get one of the few seats I like. The outdoor seating is nice, but you won't last long in the evening if you dislike smoke nor in the day if you dislike ducks.
Some fools who go here see fit to feed the ducks, which during the day results in ducks coming to you begging for food and crapping nearing your feet. And god help you if you kick them way, you'll have to suffer the disdainful looks of the high school girls who often congregate here.
The various non-coffee/tea drinks I've tried aren't good. They're usually just a blend of ice, some sort of syrup or soda, and (depending on what you order) milk. A little fresh fruit, or frozen fruit, or any sort of 'real' ingredient, would go a long way. Instead they seem concerned with making these drinks as cheaply as possible.
The baklava I only tried once, since it tasted like it had been sitting out way too long. It's possible I just had some on a bad day, but I won't be ordering it again unless I'm really craving baklava.
Most of the baristas are friendly, but a couple are real pr*cks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them. I've also been harassed about ordering quickly, even in situations where the place is relatively empty. Sorry if I don't want to order and have my ice melt before the rest of my friends arrive!

As I said, the primary draws of this place is that it's open late and (for indie types) that it's not Starbucks. But as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't excuse the crappy non-coffee drinks and occasional unfriendliness I've experienced.",2.0
"One star for the novelty factor, one star for the friendly guys and girls making the ice cream. Very novel idea of choosing your ice-cream from start to finish and making it fresh in front of you.

The ice-cream was door-stop dense and curiously not that cold. The line was Looooooooonng. It took forevvvvvvverrrrr to get our ice-cream. And it was about 9pm on a cold, dark January night. Would I go back? no! There are much better, yummier, quicker and less expensive options in Scottsdale. It's a gimmicky place that draws you in because it looks cool. It's a  great location but the long lines and not- that-great-ice-cream don't make it worth a second visit. Been there done that.",2.0

"This place was great for me. The ladies here we really nice. Kim took great care in shaping my nails and was even more of a perfectionist about my design than I was. She took great time getting the design right. She made me feel okay about having all sorts of specifications about how I like my nails. Angel did my feet. She was super nice and did a really thorough job. I felt really comfortable there and will definitely be back next time I'm in town. 
    What I really loved was was just how nice everyone was. Sometimes you go into a new nail spot and they just make you feel like all they want is to be done with you. But here, they made me feel like I was a regular. And they clearly have lots of regulars, as many came and went while I was there. Just a very chill vibe. I wish I lived here in Vegas so that I could come to this spot regularly. 
      My nail shape was perfect BTW! The nails design wasn't quite perfect, but I think that has more to do with my polish choice and less to with skill. Especially since Kim took so much time to perfect them.... certain types of glitter make it a little difficult to get straight lines over but she did her best to make it happen. I've honestly never had someone take so much time to get it right. And she was so patient and all the while never once made me feel bad about how long it was taking.... and I've been to many nail spots that are just super rude about any specification or detail you point out needs to be fixed.... Kim NOT ONCE did that. She noticed details before I could even point them out. I couldn't say enough good things about them. I'd give 5 stars but I tend to save 5 stars for places I've been more than once so that I can vouch for consistency.",4.0

"Absolutely great cheap and affordable place to get your car wash, you get 5 dollars off for checking into yelp. I would recommend coming here again to get your car washed. Pretty neat half mechanic shop/ half car wash. Owner is absolutely a nice gentleman, people here are great and friendly.",5.0
"This is the 3rd time eating Biaggio's food and have yet to be disappointed.  Today my wife and I shared a Greek salad as well as a (highly recommended) Philly Cheesesteak sandwich.  I walked out about $20 lighter (not including tip) and had THE BEST Philly Cheesesteak evah!!   The meat was quality (no gristle) and the mushrooms were abundant.   Imagine a hot, grilled, cheesy, mushroomy, sloppy steak sandwich.  Very flavorful without the salt.  Both salad and sandwich prepared without onions at our request.  We always feel welcomed to this community-minded establishment.   We now consider ourselves regulars.",5.0
"Biaggio is a boss. Food was excellent. Father was visiting from overseas, and he kept mentioning how great the pizza was during the meal, so much so that he claims this is the best pizza he's EVER had!

Biaggio even extended the courtesy of upgrading the pizza from a small to a medium. Eat here. You won't be disappointed. 

Thank you, Biaggio. Will be back when in LV!!",5.0
"Tried a different location today, 'delightful' experience. I did not have an appointment which wasn't an issue I was seated promptly after selecting a polish. Brian gently removed my existing acrylic and expertly applied a clean new full set. He listened carefully to my preferences and exceeded my expectations. Very happy with the shape, thickness, and NO nicks or cuts on the cuticles! 
Lovely, clean salon plenty of stations and spa chairs. The employees appeared to follow a well established process of sterilization and sanitation. I watched as they washed their own hands before and after each client. I've been to several salons that claim great sanitation, Delightful Nails actually executes it! 
I will return when ready for a fill and will try a pedi next visit.",5.0

"I've been going to Cookie's Salon for at least 2 years now, and hands down . . . or maybe hands up, she's the best in town! I love her salon; she gives the best chrome manicure ever! And, I love my pedis by Penny! She is super attentive and really works to get your feet as smooth as silk! 

I've noticed that some of the reviews that don't rate the salon as high as they should be are most likely coupon customers who try and cancel or change an appointment without adhering to their 24 hour cancelation policy. Or, they want to be given additional services for free that aren't included in the package they purchased.

These ladies are booked up solid because they're good. They will work with you if you're fair with them. After all, they are independent business women trying to make a living.

Take it from me, Polish Me Nail Boutique is the best!",5.0
"Ate here after seeing an early show one weekend. The atmosphere was simple but elegant. The staff was helpful at recommending wine and entrees. Before dinner we had cocktails at the bar while waiting for our party to arrive.  I highly recommend the Golden Triangle Mojito. It has ginger infused rum, a refreshing and spicy twist which hits the spot.  For dinner I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the duck breast. Both dishes were expertly cooked, moist, and flavorful.  For dessert I had the strawberry fields which is an angel food cake. Light and sweet perfect portion size after having a satisfying dinner. 
Our whole table enjoyed the meal and the service. I recommend it without any reservations.",5.0

"I will be reviewing this on what my experience was in attending an event, since I was not part of planning the event I attended. 

The facility was easy to find, easy to park. Very clean on the outside and inside and the restrooms were clean. The ceremony to the wedding I attended was outside and the staff had water available since it was 118 degrees out that day. The dinner/reception was inside the facility. The dinner was not plated, but buffet style, the service was great both at the cash bar and the buffet. The food was nothing special, but that could have been because of budget reasons. 

The attendees were attacked by a bunch (and I mean bunch) of bees during the ceremony that was held outside. I am guessing there is a bee hive nearby that needs to be professionally handled and moved. The flower girls did the bee dance and cuddled with the bridesmaids for most of the ceremony. 

Overall it was a nice facility and I bet it fit well within the wedding couples budget. The staff seemed attentive and friendly.",3.0
"Called Dr. Poulos with severe tooth pain this past Friday. He fit me in as an emergency the very next day ,Saturday at 12:30pm. The doctor and his assistant helped me feel comfortable and relaxed (I have knack of being scared of the dentist). Even though it was a Saturday they took their time and figured out exactly what was wrong. I needed a root canal and the doctor stayed an extra hour to perform the procedure. In no time he finished the root canal and sent me on my way with a Rx for Amoxicillin. He was extremely compassionate and helped me with my fear. My phone rang today around 3:30pm and it was Dr. Poulos (not an assistant) on the other end of the phone, He asked how I was feeling and other related dental questions. Dr. Poulos truly cares about his patients from start to finish. He is by far the most experienced and compassionate family dentist in AZ. I highly recommend him for any and all of your dental needs.",5.0
"I'd give it a half star if I could. This place is pathetic, food looks old and unappetizing, not to mention your paying $13.00 per person for old food. The food is very unappealing and looks all the same(brown gelatiness meats, old limp veggies and seafood that I wouldn't feed my pet). The Chinese place at the food court in the mall is way better, so if you don't like the food court Chinese food then this place would be joke.
I'm actually sitting in the resteraunt now and discusted with this place and had to write this review to at least warn others. It dosnt make sense as this place is surrounded by great places to eat, this is a prime location and yet they serve crap. Their only saving grace is prepackaged Hershey ice cream and the made to order hibachi.

If you really want the best Chinese buffett and can make the drive to rock hill SC , there is this place called ""AMBER"". I've been from New York to Los Angeles and I've never found a Chinese Buffett like ""Amber"". Food is absolutely wonderful and fresh.

Anyway, 
Just wanted to give you all a heads up on this place and a real honest review.
Before I came here, I read reviews on this place and thought I'd give it a chance, but the reviews must be fake and staged. 

Take care and
Good eats to all !!!!",1.0
"I hadn't been to Kona for about two years now due to bad service and always being over crowded....thought I'd give it another try since the remodel and more space. The place looks amazing. Two stories with all brand new furniture and lighting. I love the happy hour food here but sadly service is still as horrible as I remember from few years back.  Our server checked on us twice and didn't really seem to care. We had the sliders with fries, avocado egg rolls, and BBQ chicken pizza. They were all delicious and under $20. If they can hire more/better servers this place would be amazing.",2.0

"What a cool venue.  It's reasonably intimate for some decent shows.  Much better stage design than the sound academy, as it's just the right height that you can see from any spot in the hall.  

I like the design elements of the hall, and felt like it must have had some history, although I don't know it.  there's a cool balcony which provides a space away from the hipsters on the floor.  

Bar is pretty basic, rather expensive mixed drinks, average beer selection.  Kind of what you expect for a concert venue.  Staff were generally friendly though.",4.0
"Have been back a few times since my last review and have to say things are on the upswing with their food and service. We've been really happy with our burgers, salads, wings and fish and chips to name a few items.....and fries. All have been great. The service has improved 100%. Actually really refreshing!  The owners are obviously putting everything into making this a success. New bar being built outside too. We actually sat outside for dinner the other night and the patio was full of other patrons enjoying a burger and cold one on one of our first warm evenings!  

I like you, Rivals. My partner and I will be back soon.....say next Monday!",4.0
"Amazing LOOKING apartments for a fair price but the leasing office is ran poorly like most, if I work the 5pm shift, 8 times out of 10, the emotional lady at the desk closes early around 5 45 instead of 6 and I come to a closed door with no note. After asking for a receipt after paying rent the lady said ""I could see if it was a couple thousand but for 950$ you shouldn't need one"" this isn't the damn dollar menu, I have no idea why she made that remark she has some nerve. They are impossible to call and get a hold of after 4pm. The only good thing about this place, is the maintenance men and apartments themselves. I even saw two broke down cars that have been there for over a year and haven't moved, and they failed to do anything about it. It's sad to see so many leasing offices hire these emotional young women that can't manage themselves in a job like that that requires self sufficiency, go work at a forever 21.",1.0
"I lived in Vancouver but had my car serviced in Washington State because of the 40% savings.  This American dealer was AMAZING and I now hold all other Canadian dealers to that standard...all have failed!  My experience with the Mercedes dealers in Toronto has been less than exceptional.  I have heard this feedback from many friends and do not understand why these corporate stores are not the benchmark for other dealers to strive too.

Now that I live in Toronto I have taken my car for service at Mid-town Mercedes only to be disappointed.  The impression I was left with is, one, I have an older Benz and did not purchase it through them so I was not as important as ""their"" customers.  Two, I did not receive information nor was offered the 15% service discount through a corporate initiative to keep older c-class Benz owners returning to Mercedes service centers.  When I complained about this oversight I was provided a credit to my account rather than a refund.  I have no plans to return to a corporate owned location to service my vehicle.  My sales experience was no better.  The sales staff are arrogant and not welcoming, all information is logged into thier files so if you shop around the GTA you will not get a better deal at another dealership since they know your are in the market.  I saw my file and was surprized at the details logged regarding the cars I looked at.

I did purchase a new c-class but not from a corporate store (see my other reviews).  This was truly a poor experience and they will not have my future business.",1.0

"This place is over priced compared to what else is available close by like on Eglinton West. I finally saw a special posted that was priced to be justifiable. It was a spicy california roll, vegetable roll, soup, and salad. Soup and salad were normal. The rolls were very small. Not acceptable. The soy sauce is diluted. Apparently some people like to dip their sushi in water. I don't get it. This is a really small place so it's hard to have any sort of atmosphere. Finally, when I went to pay I advised the cashier that I would pay by debit. She was quick to inform me that cash is better. Personally I'm of the opinion that if you don't want to accept debit you shouldn't make the option available. I don't think I'll go back.",2.0

"I came here with my mom yesterday so that she could use a gift certificate that I had got her for her birthday (solely based on the good reviews). She got a pedicure and I decided to go ahead and get a full set. The older man, who was very nice by the way, working there put my nails on but I noticed he didn't do much to my real nails before putting on the acrylics ( cutting them, clean under the nail, push cuticles, etc.) like other salons do that I have been to. I should have spoken up about it. 

After my nails were painted and dried The problem that I noticed when I got under the natural sunlight in my car was that the polish work was no bueno. I had paint on my cuticles still as well as on the skin around my nail despite his efforts to clean up the work. I decided Ill come by tomorrow and get them re-done after all I paid 22 plus tip and I better be happy with them. 

Came by the next day the owner seemed somewhat understanding about the situation and told me should wouldn't charge me for a polish change ""THIS TIME"" but I would just be charged for the ""ombre glitter"" $2......OK Fine. The older woman working there did my nails over again and the ombre was not so ""ombre"" just a couple slaps of glitter nothing like the picture I showed her. 

Yet again after the polish dried there is still polish on my cuticles and surrounding skin. Im not quite sure what the issue is because I have never had this problem at any salon. I also feel as though if an unhappy customer comes back to your establishment and tries to give u a second chance to make it right of a bad situation they shouldn't be charged for anything as far as I am concerned I already paid to have my nails neatly painted and I didn't receive that. The quality of my nail polish was nothing compared to the pictures people have posted about this salon. Needless to say.... I won't be back.",2.0

"I've been wanting to try these Instagram famous desserts for so long, and finally got a chance to try it out! This experience turned out to be just great as it looks like!! 

1. Ube cake roll: filled with ube cream and custard. Little fancy gold paper on top, the cake part was super moist and not over sweet! Also the gold paper on top made it look so fancy~

2. Mango cheesecake: I loved each bite of it ! The texture of this cake was on another level. I could taste the light cream, chunks of mango fruit and, creamy cheesecake part, at the end the the shortbread! The chef mixed toasted pecan with the shortbread, so yummy

3. Cream puffs: so so so good!! I was wondering what's on top of the puff before I bite into it. Also I was worried abt it being too creamy and sweet! But no! When I bite in! Oh god !!!! It's was just so balanced and perfect texture !!!

"I love their fried chicken with their house made hot sauce on it. It is the epitome of southern fried chicken. The coleslaw is great and creamy. Fries are your standard crinkle cut fries but great to dip in their sauce.  I am also a fan of the polish girl and polish boy (Cleveland staple). I like the sauce but their ribs are a little fatty and not meaty, therefore I personally don't order the ribs. So that is the food. Now the atmosphere is not that great but you can't expect a fancy atmosphere and as long as you know what to expect in the neighborhood then you are fine. Now the service is another story. Expect an attitude, rude servers and someone who is just downright annoyed that you are bothering them by making them have to work by preparing your order.   They also run out of food and no matter what time it is they won't be making any more because once again it's too much work. I therefore have to call to make sure they have certain types of  food like chicken breasts before I come as I live 30 minutes away and can't tell you how many times I made the drive and was told they are out of white meat and don't plan to make anymore. They also close early if they don't feel like being open anymore. I actually had them turn the lights and drive through system off on me when I drive up an hour or two before their official closing time. So to sum up, the food is great, service is horrible so if you go in expecting someone to not like you to get some great BBQ then you will be happy.",3.0

"This was my second time staying at Luxor. I stayed here last year as well and also had a positive experience. 

I was in Vegas for two nights this weekend. Night one was spent at Flamingo and my room was junk and my experience horrible. I remembered my stay at Luxor last year was good so I left the crap hole Flamingo and came to the Pyramid! 

The basic room at Luxor was perfect. Clean and modern for a reasonable price. Bathroom was nice and the shower was really nice too! 

During my stay the fire alarm went off on my floor but issue was resolved pretty quick and staff was around to help. 

Pool at Luxor was also nice. It was busy, but after getting chairs and settled the pool was not as crowded and it was nice. $9 bud lights could go away and be cheaper tho.",5.0
"We booked our package to Las Vegas very last minute (day before departure) and got an amazing deal at The Luxor. I was a little worried at first because of all the bad review, but was pleasantly surprised. 

Our room was on the pyramid and it was big,clean and had comfortable beds. It wasn't glamorous or anything out of the ordinary but I did not come to Vegas to hang in my room all day, so I did not care. The bathroom was big and had good counter space for all the products that two girls sharing a room need. 

Yes the TV is old but who cares? I didn't come here to watch TV. The food court here is awful and the buffet looked unappetizing so we never tried it. 

Another negative is that this hotel is pretty far from most of the amenities and nicer hotels where we hung out the most. The monorail and tram connects you to these hotels, but the system is not very good and it still leaves you with a whole lot of walking to do. 

I would not stay here again, but for the price we got on our stay I have no complaints.",3.0
"First off, I am a huge Criss Angel fan and I had been wanting to stay at the Luxor for the longest time. With that being said, my experiences are as follows:

Decor: I loved the Egyptian theme and was fascinated by all the decor in and outside of the hotel. I was super excited to see Criss Angel stuff all over the hotel.

Room: We stayed in the pyramid part of the hotel and price was very affordable. The slanted Windows were pretty cool and the beds were quite comfortable. 

Food: The food court was convenient during the day, but if you're looking for something late at night, backstage deli by the Criss Angel theatre has some great options. For breakfast I was able to buy a filling bagel breakfast sandwich for no more than $6.

Casino: Not as crowded as some of the others I had visited, which was good. The bar had fast service and the drink servers throughout the casino were very nice. 

Cleanliness: Restrooms around the hotel were kept very clean. Our room was also very clean when we first arrived and kept nice and refreshed throughout our stay. 

Convenience: Designated Uber and Lyft stops which was perfect for catching rides to other parts of the strip. We took a Grand Canyon tour bus and it was also very convenient to catch the bus on the Luxor property. Indoor walkways to Mandalay bay and Excalibur were great for getting around to the other casinos. 

Overall, I greatly enjoyed my stay here at the Luxor. It was everything I expected plus more. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends and family.",5.0
"If I could rate this hotel as 1/2 a star, I would. I was looking to find a decent hotel to spend a summer weekend in Vegas with my boyfriend. Sure, Luxor had a great budget-friendly rate to offer for a weekend stay. That may have been the problem; you get what you pay for. 

Upon arrival, the concierge didn't even confirm the type of room I had requested. Instead, he just gave me a standard room when I clearly requested an upgrade as part of my MLife rewards. I decided not to ruin my trip over that ""small"" matter. That became the least of my worries as the weekend progressed. On the first night, I noticed an awful smell coming from the A/C vent, and realized that it was leaking and the water was being absorbed in the carpet leaving a humid smell. I called guest services and they assured me that someone would take care of the problem in the next hour. After waiting an hour, my boyfriend and I decided to leave so we could make it to our dinner reservation, and I called guest services to let them know.

After a long night out, we returned only to find that nothing had been taken care of. I was soo upset at this point and called for the third time!  The representative told me they couldn't switch rooms and that instead, he could give me a 20% discount for the inconvenience. I decided that if they took care of it by the next day, it wouldn't be a problem. Day 2 came along and still, the A/C was leaking. I talked to a representative in person, and they offered me yet another discount. Why can't these people just move our room and fix the damn leak?!

Finally, we checked out on the 3rd day and made it safely back home to San Diego. Upon our return, we noticed that my boyfriends 2 pairs of shoes were missing! We had a bellman pick up our things when we had checked out and they had lost the bag of shoes, about $150 value for both pairs. I was sooo furious, and this time, I called and asked for the Manager of VIP sales. After making a big fuss, he decided to waive our 1 night stay since he couldn't find the bag. 

All in all, it was a horrible experience, to say the least. Customer service should be priority, and for a Las Vegas Strip hotel, Luxor is not worth a dime! Spend your money elsewhere and save yourself the hassle of dealing with incompetent and unprofessional hotel staff.",1.0

"Mitch, the tour guide, was a wealth of knowledge about Vegas.  Really loved this tour.  The neighborhood needs a lot to be desired.  Not a place you'd walk around.

Half of the tour is in direct sun.  We ended up going early in the morning.  Totally worth the money to visit!",5.0
Its just really cool to see all those refurbished signs looking just as good as they did when they were brand new. Love what they are doing to beatify this part of downtown.

"The food was good, but if the service could match the food it would have been that much better. 
- Server didn't greet us until I actually asked where our server was.
- Smiled once when he greeted us but otherwise when taking our order didn't smile or make us feel welcome.
- Never checked up to ask how the food was despite the fact that he DID NOT serve us our food.
- Hovered over me while I was paying, made me feel pressured to tip more than I would have because of the bad service.

all in all, food was pretty good but I definitely feel the service makes up 50% of the experience at the restaurant. This guys needs more training on how to create a better customer experience!",3.0
"Gave this a try based on other Yelp reviews. You know how you read about a restaurant with mixed reviews, and you just hope that the reviewers with the bad reviews were really picky? Yeah, that's what I was hoping.

I'm here to say that the reviews weren't wrong; service is definitely lacking at La Catrina, and one of the reasons we likely won't return.

When we arrived around 6 for dinner, there were multiple tables on the right side of the restaurant shoved together, with a bunch of kids and adults who looked to have recently been to a swim meet. There were several booths in the area with kids and adults too. 

The person seating my husband and I bypassed several empty tables on the left side of the restaurant, and tried to seat us at a booth in between and right in the middle of all the kids and adults.

I've got nothing against kids, but why would you sit two adults who are just hoping to have a nice meal in the very center of tables with mostly kids when there are so many other tables available?

I asked that we move to a different area, so instead of putting us somewhere quieter, he just moved us to a booth on the other side of the same section. Noise level was pretty intense until the large groups left.

We tried to order beers on draft, but were informed draft beer was not available for some reason. So we ordered two bottled beers. It took 10+ minutes for us to get our beers. I was in full sight of the bar so I watched as our waiter didn't even try going to the bar to get our beers until roughly the 10 minute mark. 

When our beers were finally brought, my husband had been given the wrong one. The waiter was pouring out of the bottles into the glasses and my husband had to ask him to remove his hand from the label so he could confirm which beer it was. He'd ordered a darker beer and noticed the beer being poured was more of a light ale/lager style.

Our food wasn't memorable, but it was okay. Salsa was really watered down and runny.

There are so many better Mexican restaurants within a 5 minute drive, that I just can't imagine why we would ever return here again.",1.0
"A busy Labor Day so I'm partial to that today. With that said, we waited the standard 30 minutes to sit down. What really sucked is we waited 45 minutes to get our meals and to me this is unacceptable at this place. It's not like we ordered a steak, deep dish pizza or a soufflé. Any way the food was great and the chef bought us dessert. Happy. 
Clean place with good ambience.",4.0
"Went with our daughter for Father's Day brunch. Must say we really enjoyed eating here, it has a cozy feel with comfortable seating, good service and great food. My daughter and I had the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes with honey butter , comes with fresh blueberries and crispy bacon. Perfect size, moist and delicious. My husband had the eggs and bacon and his fried eggs were cooked perfectly. My mother had the red velvet pancakes topped with marscapone, she loved it but I tried it and to me it tasted too much like dessert. Not that it wasn't delicious; just too sweet for me.  All-on-all we were very pleased and will return again.",5.0
"The Herb Box is my kind of restaurant.  Everything on their menu looked appealing, and fresh, with lots of veggies.  My friend and I split the mezze and the brussel sprout flatbread sans pancetta.  Both were excellent, but the real star was the flatbread, the combination of cheese and roasted garlic was delectable.  We also had mimosas along with our meal, and with mango instead of orange juice, they felt extra special.  

The service here was great, and they had a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your meal on.  The location in the middle of Scottsdale can't be beat either.",4.0
"12/2/10

2.5 stars.

Took my young cousin w/ me for happy hour and sat at the bar; This was her first time at O&I.  While I really like the look and the feel of the island layout of O&I's bar, I always feel like a fish out of water when I sit there.  (I've actually tried sitting there a few times when I've walked in solo, but always ended up moving to a table.  If it weren't for my cousin at my side, I probably would've moved to a table again, or, worse yet, walked out of the resto, which I've done before, too.)  Despite a few attempts at getting her to try a cocktail, she declined, and thus I proceeded to just order a glass of wine.  Why it's so hard to get a sampling of a couple of wines before settling on one to order here, I'll never know.  (Just a few nights ago, while at Beckett's Table, my server offered to have me try sips of the two wines I was having trouble choosing!)  Tsk, tsk, tsk!

We decided to try the Italian Sausage flatbread and the hummus app.  The flatbread, w/ its tasty and spicy Italian sausage chunks, consisted of a crispy crust w/ vibrant red piquillo peppers and creamy goat cheese-- I'd order this again, even though peppers and I don't exactly get along.  The hummus was equally delightful, w/ house-made pita bread and a ""petite Greek salad,"" which actually consisted of only sliced red grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers (a no-no for me!) and a ton of feta on top.  Why the salad was piled ON TOP of the hummus, and not on the side, I don't know.  I suppose for the price of the app, I shouldn't expect more veggies used (a bit of lettuce, perhaps?), but it would've been nice to be able to pick the cukes out.  Served as it was, on top of the hummus, which looked like it was baked for a few minutes before getting the salad treatment, spooning the cukes off would've entailed major loss of delicious baked hummus goodness.  And we wouldn't have any of that!

I really wished we could've stayed past 6p to check out the celebrity guest bartender, but we had other appointments to keep.  My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering.  

FYI, the happy hour menu changed, drastically reduced to only maybe 8 items or less, down from practically all of the apps and half of the flatbreads and a couple of salads that the old HH menu contained.  Recalling this, plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents, I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long, long time...",3.0
"I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.

We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant. 

Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.

I've never leave reviews but because of the quality of service and meal, I must.
Thank you!",5.0
"I love Olive and Ivy. It is a tried and true staple, always the first place I bring an out of town visitor.  

The ambience inside is warm and charming, open and friendly, and classy.  I loove thier lighting it is just so inviting.  Tables are spaced nicely, the bar has great seating and not too packed in that area either.  You can order a meal at the bar without feeling like you're knocking elbows with the person next to you.

The outside of Olive and Ivy is my favorite though.  The social hour seating fills up QUICK - get there early.  There are comfy big chairs and couches right outside the waterfront.  It is my favorite sitting spot in all of scottsdale to eat drink and dine.

For food -- I've come here plenty, and here's my two cents. Skip the apps, share a salad with a friend, and enjoy an entree. I keep coming back to the veal ravioli, it is just heavenly and perfect.  There is arugula on top with a light cream sauce which isn't too heavy at all. I have to force myself to explore the menu because this dish is just so good.  Last time I was here I was trying to stick to my diet, I ordered the salmon and subbed spinach instead of thier regular side.  The dish was perfect, salmon was grilled to perfection, a real fresh piece of fish. It was generous too (more generous portion than the ravioli) - and I actually ended up taking some home. My mom ordered the Cioippino, which was flavorful, a generous portion, and very good also.  I also love their scallop entree.  I don't eat a ton of red meat, but I went with a friend one time who ordered the steak and pretty much devoured it.  

As for drinks -- thier sangria is amaze! Stick with the red one.

Honestly I'm writing this right now, a warm February day in Arizona, and want to leave work to sit outside and eat my lunch in pure bliss at Olive and Ivy. I have a day off later this week and will make sure I stop by.  I simply cannot get enough of this place.",5.0

"yeah, it might be a little eerie and kill bill-ish in there, but the food is fantastic. we were the only ones in there for a while so it was extra eerie..the service was alright. very ethnic and authentic chinese atmosphere, not so americanized.

the pot of tea was piping hot but especially delicious. the wonton chips were a good start. we went with the moo shoo pork and kung pao chicken, both pretty good. the crepes that the moo shoo pork came in were so soft and fluffy and the meat and seasonings were spot on. the kung pao chicken was a little water and not as spicy as i thought it was going to be. but it had peanuts, bamboo shoots, and my favorite chinese vegetable, water chestnuts...mmmm. the big bowl of rice we got was delicious as well.

and all for under $20. grubby good. especially for a city with lackluster chinese food.",4.0
"We just returned from the restaurant tonight.  First off, I'm giving this 5 stars because the food was wonderful (and really, that's 95% of what you should be rating a restaurant on) and the service staff was incredibly attentive but not annoyingly so that it interrupted your experience.  I do have some suggestions that I'll get to in a second - but first, the food!  

The meal started with a free appetizer of biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were wonderful and not overly floured or dense - they were quite airy for a biscuit and tasted homemade.  The gravy was also delicious - it was not gloopy/lumpy and didn't get that ""film"" that appears when it's been sitting around too long - i.e. it was fresh.  there were bits of sausage in it as well that really added a nice dose of the south (I hope they are some day able to expand to offering breakfast with biscuits and gravy this good.)

My wife and I both dined tonight, she had meatloaf with fried cabbage and green beans and I had fried chicken (paid the $1 extra to get the white meat) with macaroni and greens.  We're both from Florida and miss this food dearly as it's certainly in short supply out here.  The chicken pieces were quite large, had a wonderful batter, and the meat was not dry at all.  My wife is incredibly picky about meatloaf but absolutely loved it.  It's much chunkier than meatloaf you'll find at most restaurants but that's simply because they don't overdo the bread crumbs in the recipe.  I will say that I would actually order the meat loaf myself (and I generally do NOT like meat loaf at all because it always has too much bread added to the mix).  

The sides are really the star of the show here, my greens were sensational, they weren't of the ""canned spinach"" consistency that some places fall victim to - nor were they undercooked.  They were juuuuust right!  My wife was not overly fond of the green beans but I on the other hand loved them as that had that faintly sweet and smoky taste and included bits of onion to compliment the beans.  We were similarly divisive (albeit in reversed roles) with the fried cabbage as she loved it but it just wasn't for me - different tastes is all that boiled down to, there was nothing wrong with it, and again, the wife loved it and would get it again in a heart beat.  Oh, and last but not least, the macaroni and cheese, if they ever get around to catering, we both agreed that we could see ourselves ordering a tray of this magical blend of pasta and cheese.  It's been a long time since either of us have had macaroni and cheese that is done that well.  The menu states that it's a 5 cheese blend - I can only say it was utterly and insanely delicious.  It did taste oven baked but at the same time the pasta wasn't complete mush like what happens.  Regardless of how it was made, just wonderful all around.  

We did end our meal by sharing a banana pudding and I do believe the wife would have eaten the entire thing by herself had I stepped away for even a minute or two.  One thing you'll notice right off the bat if you order it is that the pudding isn't the dyed yellow pudding you see in stores.  it's the real-deal with vanilla wafers that aren't stale and mush.  It was the perfect compliment to a wonderful meal.  I believe they serve it in the jar it comes in so they don't have patrons licking the surface clean.  I'm eager to try the sweet potato pie next time (the wife is looking forward to peach cobbler).

Now, that I've had a chance to go over the food I wanted to mention a few other things that I've seen some folks point out on here.  First off, please, please, PLEASE,  pay attention to the hours the dining room is open before you come out here hoping to dine-in as this is a restaurant you should want to see thriving in Surprise (otherwise known as the land of chain restaurants).  They have limited dining room hours and do take-out only for a good chunk of the day.  For instance today they were open from 11a-4pm for take-out only and then 4p-8p for dine-in.  We had actually come by for lunch earlier and had to leave since it wasn't open for dining yet. 

Another suggestion I would have (if any of the restaurant staff happens to read this) is that you add a menu option that maybe offers 4 sides as your meal (yes, your sides are that amazing).  I know there is the option to order individual sides, but much like the reduced price you get by ordering a ""meal"" that includes the two sides I think you could do fairly well adding a menu option that gives you your choice of 4 sides for maybe $12.  

Finally, towards the end of our meal the owner came out and walked around and greeted everybody except for us lol (we were sitting on the backside of a large 6 top and she just got distracted by the interaction with that table - no offense taken!).  But had she stopped by our table I would have gladly given a hug back (she certainly gives them out) for the wonderful food you've brought to our very own backyard.  We'll be back!",5.0
"They were quite helpful when we went in. I had to special-order an item. I later found it at Lowe's in stock and $11 cheaper. I called Ace to cancel my special order. The girl asked if I could calk back in the morning! No, I work, I am calling now. ?  Good service except that.",4.0

Over rated.  Service was very good.  Food is ok.  Not great by any means.  Meatballs was the best thing I had.  Chicken balls were over cooked and had a crust on the outside because they were old.  Salad had too much dressing and salty.  The prosciutto was very fatty. The sliders were the horrible. Meat was over cooked and small compared to the size of the bun.  Not coming back,3.0
"We were really looking forward to visiting Giada while in Vegas. When we arrived at 6:50 for our 7:00 reservation we were told that it would only be a few minutes till our table was ready. Unfortunately they did not seat us until 7:20 which I could look past barbecue we had fun in the photo booth in the lobby. I had requested (a month in advance) a window seat looking out to the Strip, but we were escorted to a table next to the bar away from the main dining room. I asked if they were able to honor my request and they said that the restaurant was full and we would have to wait another 30-40 minutes to be seated over there by the windows. We declined since it was already 7:30 at this point and were all hungry. Fast forward to the service: Our waiter was very nice yet slightly disconnected and informed us to stick with the cocktails on the iPad and not to venture off. The food came out fast and was very good overall and very inventive as you would expect from a Giada ""crafted"" Menu. When it came time for desert we were told we would have to wait about 10 minutes for the cart to come over so we could see the daily offering which at first I thought it was a really cool concept. What wasn't cool is after waiting 10 minutes the cart came over looking very sparse with very little to choose from. We picked a few items out and felt very underwhelmed with the taste compared to the looks. Overall we had an OK experience. Perhaps it was to early on and they were working out the bugs. We will be back to give it another try but I really hope they nail it.",3.0
"This place is amazing. The view is spectacular and you don't feel like you are in Vegas. The presentation is so classy and elegant. You get greeted at the door, and they bring you to the table and the staff is super friendly and the hospitality is #1. Avi the general manager came around and introduced himself and made sure everything is fine.  
Giada herself made a round and I was able to take a photo.  Actually she took the selfie photo and was super friendly and sweet. She looked busy and she really cares about this place because she was talking to all of the staff. The staff knew the menu well, and gave great recommendations, and they knew their wine pairing s with the food.  They are super staffed and are alert on what is going on as in food coming on time, drinks being filled up, and the timing was all perfect as the food came out.  The pasta was fresh, the soup and salad was amazing and just the right portions.  Make sure you leave room for the dessert!!! They have an amazing dessert cart that comes around and everything was made fresh and healthy.   I had the polenta cake with the fresh coffee gelato. 

This is one of the trendiest hottest new restaurants in Vegas. The best part of it is the location because you get natural light and it is not dark and dingy like the rest of the trendy Vegas restaurants.  The food is fresh, homemade, and amazing.  The best Staff! Super friendly and nice.",5.0
"The first time I went here, I felt like Giada's was AMAZING! The cute Pinterest-y modern decor, the attentive waiters and busers, the lovely cocktails and yummy lemon butter/capers/sea salt/peppers to accompany the bread. The portions of entrees were small and expensive, but good. I was very satisfied.

However, upon my second visit, I was VERY disappointed. The staff were as helpful as ever, but the food was terrible! My chicken soup tasted like it came from a can. The lobster ravioli tasted so bland, the sauce (despite being lovely) couldn't help it, the Alfredo sauce with the spaghetti tasted like it came from a jar. What happened?! 

With the brand, hype, and price of Giada's you would expect more. I give three stars for a great first impression and great service, but minus two stars for the inconsistency and price. For the pricing, it feels like a rip off.",3.0

Although the bakery looks small it offers a large variety of items, from cookies, cakes, breads and even prepackaged treats everything looked amazing.

"Well shit, maybe I should have read Yelp (Martin S.) before coming here, as we ordered TWO Mexican themed dishes: the breakfast burrito and the quesadilla. The burrito was straight up bad (0/5). The eggs were under-seasoned and the beans were straight out of the can. If you advertise re-fried beans, at least mash them up to make them look like somebody hasn't just popped open a can and poured the cold beans into the burrito with no care. 

The quesadilla was a bit redeeming but still quite bad. The chorizo was okay, and there was some salt in the eggs. 

On the plus side, the potatoes are actually very good here. And I had I read the reviews before coming here, maybe the other offerings would have been as good as the potatoes.

The $3 coffee is also pretty steep and kind of annoying. 

With Parts and Labour open on Sundays, and a couple of other brunch places up the road on Roncevalles, don't think I'll be coming back here.",2.0
"For me this place hits home. I really love Hawaiian food and something about the food here is just the closest thing I have to the big island. The guys behind the glass are so kind, I came in a group of 3 and one of them wasn't really hungry but they insisted he eat. It was that Hawaiian culture that nobody sits and doesn't eat. I really enjoy the teriyaki chicken here, as they mentioned it was the top seller.

I always go for the Ono (small) plate, it comes with brown rice or white rice, just keep in mind that the brown rice is an additional $.60 charge. The proteins available are teriyaki chicken, kahlua pig, chicken wings or you can pay the extra $1 for the ahi or steak. 

The mac salad on the side is also my favorite mac salad of any Hawaiian spot in the valley. Something about it here tastes extra fresh and there's that love put into the recipe that I really admire also!

I was in the area and wanted to get something yummy to eat and I knew this wouldn't disappoint.",5.0
"Jeffrey trill general manager holiday inn express peoria

On Thursday, October 29th, 2015 I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Peoria, AZ. I was in town, along with the rest of our family, to attend a funeral. We arrived around 6:30pm only to drop off our bags and head to the Wake. When i went back later that evening to my room, ready to shower, exhausted from the long drive i noticed long black hairs on the walls of the shower & the drain. I was so disgusted. There was no question that it was mine since i have red hair. (I took pictures as well). It was only myself and my brother in the room. It is now late in the evening & checkout is in the morning & we attend the funeral.  Since the phone in my room wasnt working, I went to the front desk & the employee said she can leave a note for the manager in the morning. At 7am i speak w the General Manager, Jeffrey Trill, and he speaks so fast as though he was being accused of something & i said i would either like a free night for that evening or a future date & he immediately started talking defensively & 100 mph. His exact response was ""my hands  are tied since you booked your room through Expedia. I cannot do anything for u except offer you a late check out at 2:30pm"" That was my ONLY option. To stay in a dirty room, longer. I was in town for a funeral, not a vacation. My mind is mourning & i had to deal with this type of customer service. Apparently, since i went through Expedia i was not treated like a valued customer and it didnt matter to him that our entire family booked about 12 other rooms in the same hotel. i called Expedia customer care & they spoke with Jeffrey Trill, the General Manager & suddenly his hands weren't tied like he said. Now he only offered to refund $24.48.  Again, my ONLY option i am given. I went down stairs to speak with him and asked how he justified a dirty room with $24.48? And again he started talking super fast and defensively & told me i went through Expedia, a 3rd party, and his voice intensified louder. Only then at that point did i realize i am in a small town and if i have to get this resolved i have to go higher up. I then contacted Corporate a few days later. Where they agreed that he didnt even offer 1/3 of a refund & he handled the situation incorrectly & offered further alternatives. Thank you to corporate my issue was resolved. 

If anyone ever has to deal with this manager in the future, it is best to contact Corporate while still in the hotel. That is what they recommended to do. No customer should be treated this way.  

i will continue to stay at Holiday Inn hotels, this is a rare case, but this is a dirty hotel.

"i actually thought this one was better than ""O.""  a lot people praise ""O,"" saying it's the best one in vegas, but i beg to differ.  i've seen my share of cirque de soleil shows, and i saw both ""O"" and Ka and i thought Ka was amazing!!  don't get me wrong...i thought ""O"" was great too, but i thought Ka stepped it up a notch better.  i liked that it had a storyline and that each segment connected to the next somehow.  the theater setup was pretty awesome as well.  If people expect this to be an ""Asian"" show, it's not really an Asian show and it wasn't really advertised to be an Asian show either.  I actually thought the show was going to revolve around fire, but it didn't.  The focus was more on the story, artistry and acrobatics.  they gave the characters character, so they weren't all just seen as acrobats like in all the other cirque shows.  on a side note, if you're giving Ka a bad review because you were drunk or YOU didn't understand the storyline, than that's your fault, not theirs so you shouldn't penalize them for that; you shouldn't even write a review in that case.  anywho, i highly recommend Ka and i would totally go watch it again!

"I liked it but it's not my favorite Cirque show. This show focuses on stage movement, storyline, costumes, and battle scenes. 

The theater is tucked way inside the MGM, so give yourself ample time to arrive and get a drink. The show bar has excellent prices on alcohol. I got a large glass of Pinot Grigio for $7. The show starts out a bit slow, probably for late arrivals - don't be one of those people. There is very little audience interaction. 

There are some acrobatic moves that will make you gasp for air but not as many as say, Mystere or Zarkana. A couple of funny moments pop up, but again, not as much as you will find in their other shows. What this show did provide were some incredible battle scenes, stage movement, and pyrotechnics. 

The first three rows are great for some shows, but not for this one. Grab a seat a few rows back, so that you get the full view and won't leave with a neck ache.",4.0

    The doctor was very nice, but she called us into the room then proceeded to chat with everyone waiting, um hello let's get this over with I'm already 40 minutes past my appointment. now to add more fuel to my fire and why I updated to only 1 star is because I have very good insurance through aetna, my vaccines are 100% covered..well I received a letter stating ""we have billed your credit card for the balance owed after the charges for this visit were processed by your insurance company""...ok now I called my insurance, Walgreen never submitted the claim, then I get on the phone with Walgreens  billing, the gentleman on the phone was really rude and I could tell he was rushing me off the phone, he told me that they have a contract through aetna where vaccines are ""exclusive"" and they are not allowed to Bill the insurance company..really WTF.. so I had to get back on the phone with Aetna and they said, no they receive claims from Walgreens all the time for vaccines...so I'm not sure what kind of funny business is going on with Walgreens billing department or if the workers just don't want to do their jobs and are lazy and rude,...but now I have to submit reimbursement forms to my insurance, just a pain ughh! I will NEVER come back to Walgreens for anything ever!! ..next time I'll be smarter and schedule an appointment with my primary doctor!",1.0
"Update: the place seems to be under new ownership, the selection is roughly the same as before, although no more plate of seafood included for each customer. The food quality has gone down and the kitchen seems to be running out of everything such as lamb, ox touge ect. The orders are all messed up for each table too. I am not sure if it's gonna improve overtime or not. I will avoid this place for now. 



Older version: Very good selection on variety. From what I can tell, it is cleaner than most restaurants in China town. You are gonna get a pretty good hotpot experience if you know what you are doing.",2.0
"I've stayed at The Mirage twice now, once one the 1st floor villa, and last weekend in a regular room. The service was excellent both trips. On my last stay, I had to call the front desk 3x which were all handled A1 by Manny, Charlie, and James. I love the tropical dome that you will see right when you enter the hotel. You'll instantly feel relaxed and cool from the desert outside. Make sure to check out the bar next to check in between 1pm-3pm. Drinks are 2-1 and if Jaime is there, he'll hook it up fat. The rooms are a bit far away from the front desk. Other than that, I love staying here since its in the middle of the strip. You can walk to Omnia in 5 minutes :)",4.0

"3 stars here. Places like Geisha House with the hibachi are one of my favorite places to eat. Unfortunately my wife is not fond of the food, so I rarely get to go. Last night my wife was generous and suffered through it. Geisha is good but not my favorite. It is our first try since moving to vegas. The biggest issue I had was they did not introduce enough favors to the rice, not sure exactly what it was missing but it just wasn't as good as I remember elsewhere. I was also not thrilled with the vegetable selection, my favorite is the zucchini and I got hardly any on my plate. The price is quite steep, but that is commonplace at establishments like this. Their ginger dressing on the salad is actually not that tasty. Overall I was disappointed and not sure if we will return.",3.0

In 2 weeks, I had no improvement so I went into the person I have received Botox from for the last 10 years.  She agreed with my assessment that I had not been given Botox or it was so watered down.

"I used to visit the Grand Lux in Beverly Hills when I lived in Los Angeles and its Palazzo location is just the same - which is expected with chain restaurants. 

The Grand Lux is conveniently located near the base of the hotel room elevators and is almost never crowded. The portions are huge, the prices are decent and the menu is extensive. After a couple of visits, however, you tend to get sick of the food because its so heavy and rich. 

Visit before 3:00 p.m. to take advantage of their lunch prices and portions, which are about half the size of their regular portions but still pretty big! 

Three and a half stars.",4.0
Standards are great when it comes to franchises.  You expect a certain product and as long as that happens younger satisfied so this place is a no brainer.  You always get what you are expecting.  My only issue with this spot that causes my average rating is I think the prices are too high. Lower the prices and I would come more often and give you more stars but price does play into my ratings.,3.0

"Go big or go home! Gallagher's portion of meat is huge, and quality of meat is great. I had the dry aged New York steak (delicious) with mashed and wedge salad. My boyfriend had Porterhouse (delicious) with Caesar salad, and mushrooms. We both drank Cabernet along with our dinner and wish there was room for dessert. This is the 2nd time I ever had fine dining, so I wasn't really surprise about the price for 2 which came down about $160. Overall experience, we were satisfied.

P.S. If you get the wedge salad, you have to expect a wedge of lettuce with little dressings on it. I didn't expect it to look that way, but soon I cut them into pieces and toss them with a Thousand Island dressing. It was quite fresh and crispy, I must admit.",4.0
Can't say enough about our experience here.  This restaurant is in NYNY so we had dinner while staying there on a recent trip to Vegas.  It was amazing.  I ordered the filet and my husband got the strip.  We both agree that they were two of the best steaks we have ever had. The service was great and they even brought my husband a birthday dessert.  Excellent dinner....would HIGHLY recommend.  Well worth the money!,5.0

"For some reason, I remembered the hotel used be more fancier then it is. Perhaps that was a few too many years ago... lol 
I still do love this casino and lodge though! It's comfy and cozy but the rooms are ready for an upgrade. For example, the bathroom really old school and TV, which was a small 27'' old school TV. 

-No free wifi :-( - (although you can steal from their or others unsecured network, it was still not convenience) 

They have Bath and Body Works products! That's one of the reason I wanted to come back here..lol But the bottles are so small, it's barely enough for 2 people. 

The pool area is gorgeous, but it was too cold to go swimming this Winter :-( 
It's about 6 miles off the strip, so if you do not have a car, it's not convenient. They do have daily free shuttle service to the Strip. 

Overall, the stay was great. It was promo special $60 buy one night get second night free! Definitely a great deal. But watch out for their (Las Vegas) new 15% or so extra service amenity charge. I felt like I was cheated from that.",3.0

"All n all a good joint. Nice people. Clean and nice atmosphere. My wife likes the cheap mass produced commercial pizza places. I love these local joints. 
Good ingredients not to greasy thin crust the way it should be like back east. Just a touch of crispyness. I would give it five but my only complaint was the ingredients wanted to slide off. Now that is not a complaint because they were not cheap when it came to toppings. Probably had a touch to much sauce but the sauce was tasty n I am not a big pizza sauce guy. Good work guys and I'll be back. N if you haven't tried it support your local joints and try it. U won't be disappointed.",4.0
"I'm not a big fan of Thai food flavors, but I came here with a group. Something about the spices, curry, and especially hot sauce just doesn't appeal to me. Either way I made the best out of the situation and enjoyed a so-so meal.

The food did take a while to come (about 20 min), probably it was a busy weekend night (in fact we waited 40 minutes to get into the restaurant, but they helpfully let us wander around the city and call us when a table was ready). The waiters helpfully came around about every 20 minutes to check up on our plates and water, and our waiter was super professional and efficient at handling the payment.

The interior decor is quite complete, and the place is dimly lit in very orange light. I was intrigued by the dining section where you could take off your shoes and sit on your legs on cushions.",3.0

"Don't gamble at the airport. The games are better on the strip! If you get here at a peak time, you will wait a long time for your luggage. And I mean a LONG time like over an hour. Sometimes it's best to just go have a drink instead of standing there waiting for something to happen.

Also, they tell you to get there two hours before your flight leaves. Don't believe them unless you are leaving at 5:00p on a Sunday afternoon or something like that. Flights before 11:00a are a piece of cake to make even with security.

Cabs are easy to find. If you pay more than 25 bucks to get to a hotel on the strip, you have been screwed by your cabbie. Remember that when he looks at you like it's time for a tip. To give you an idea of how to measure, the Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Aria and Cosmo are all about $15 - $20 to the airport. If they try charging you more, they are robbing you.",4.0
"Whackkasan or Hakkasuck?

Let me first say, I'm thankful we were able to take advantage of getting on the guest list, and we got in for free. The guest list people here are on top of their game and very fast and friendly; if only for them they get 5 stars from me. Totally unlike LA clubs where the Guest list line is so long and pretty much ignored until the cut off time. And it was cool that you go up the elevator and down the hall like it's some secret place.

Not cool was this club is basically 80% VIP tables. And it's SO much smaller than what I imagined! The dance floor is small. There's no other place to dance bc of all the tables. Upstairs is ALL tables. 90% of them were empty.

You know what else is not cool? Playing WHACK ass music before the main DJ comes on. ""Hip Hop hooray! Ho! Hey! Ho!"" Yes I'm serious. We stayed for about an hour and couldn't take it anymore, so we left before Jesse Marco came on. We hadn't heard of him before, so we looked on Youtube and he's got kind of a Justice thing going on. Too bad, but we couldn't stand it anymore.

I can't believe the line for the people PAYING to get in! Well I guess they have to make the money to be able to pay their DJs $100-250 grand per gig.

Chicken Vindaloo and Lamb Roganjosh stole the show with intense flavor and spice.  Chicken tikka Marsala and mutter with paneer were also delicious.

(Side-note: It's quite loud, and you have to kind of yell to people - even if you're right beside them. Perhaps not the best place if you're looking for an intimate night out. However, the service, menu, and atmosphere MORE than make up for that.) I'm excited to come back soon!",5.0

"I am not very good at wrapping gifts without them looking rather messy.  So, for a recent special occasion, I took the gift (a book) in to Alligator Soup to have it professionally wrapped.  
The store is crazy-packed with all kinds of generic gifts, greeting cards and such.  It was hard to even tell where the register was because the counter was so cluttered.  I was told it would be $7.50 for the wrapping and was shown some gift wrap to choose from.  I was very surprised at the limited choices of solid color paper, but selected one.  I was not asked about the occasion or the accompanying ribbon.  I was very surprised at the finished result - you could see the title of the book right through the paper.  I mentioned this to the lady helping me, but she just offered to move the bow.  No thanks!  I have had gifts wrapped at Papyrus before and the results were beautiful.  For $7.50, I would expect them to have a better quality paper or to at least double wrap it.  It felt like a rip-off and I don't feel as though the clerk really cared.  I wouldn't go back for anything.",1.0
"If you want an infection, come here. Being in the industry, I know not to come to chop shops but they were the only ones open at 8pm and needed it that night. If you get the guy who works there, run as fast as you can out of there. He pretended to get the tools out of the autoclave. I say pretended because I saw that he didn't have to open the package to get the tools out, he simply just dumped them out without opening the tab that is supposed to be sealed shut. They just place the dirty tools back in the same package so it looks like they are coming out of a new sterilized pack. Once I said something he rolled his eyes at me and said something to the co worker next to him. Things like this went on the whole time. His body was turned, looking at the tv behind him while he was pushing my cuticles back. Which obviously he wasn't doing because he wasn't watching, so he was actually pushing on the top of my toe. I had to ask for the buffer to buff my own nails, because he didn't understand when I asked him to do it. He must have gotten upset that I said something because then he jabbed me with a sharp tool underneath my nail bed. I hope to god I don't get hep c or something. Then at the end I had to ask for the polish back so I could redo all the spots he missed. Horrible!! I guess it was my fault for going to a chop shop but I didn't know they were this bad!",1.0
"I LOVE SUGAR FACTORY!!!

Pro: Restaurant food and drinks were AMAZING! Well Priced! Open 24 hrs

Con: Desserts are TERRIBLE! Don't bother trying them.

This was one place on my trip to Vegas that I definitely wanted to stop in because of their amazing looking drinks. I also wanted to check out the crystallized lollipops just to see what they looked like.

In a great location across from our hotel, this was the perfect location to start our trip. We had lunch here around 2 pm, and we got a good view of the Bellagio water show (daytime version). Cozy, not over air-conditioned like most places in Vegas, and reasonably priced.

I had the Turkey burger with sweet potato fries and it was DELISH! My 3 other friends enjoyed their meals, as well. The drinks... were... PHENOM! They were also HUGE so we split 2 drinks among 4 girls. We had the lollipop signature drink, and the gummi bear drink. I preferred the gummi bear. It was just sweet enough and tasted like juice. Just the presentation of the drinks was awesome... they bring out the ""fish bowl"" like glasses with ice, and pour the drink in front of you so it gives off a dry ice effect. So worth it! 

Now for the bad... we returned here for dessert before our flight home. This must be where the bad reviews for this place come from. The gelato was chalky, I personally had a ""Barbi"" smoothie and it was TERRIBLE... tasted like pure strawberry syrup. For an $8 shake, I couldn't wait to toss it out, it was that bad. We also brought back the little cupcake cookie jars, and the cookies were stale and not tasty. My cousin tried the Red Velvet cupcake and it was dry, hard, and tasteless.... so basically, all their desserts are a no go... from the gelato, to shakes, cupcakes, and cookies. 

Go for the restaurant... food and drinks are AMAZING! I'd eat here again!",4.0

"Came here to order the frozen hot chocolate but also had a meal. I can see why it has an average of 3 stars. Ordered the Alfredo pasta which came with 2 slices of garlic focaccia, literally 4 slices of tomato and 3 pieces of boiled broccoli and I think it's $4 more to add chicken (which we did). The pasta tasted ok but it was not worth the price. 

We ordered the double chocolate version of the frozen hot chocolate and it was not as great as I expected but it definitely cooled us down from the obliterating Vegas summer heat! I swear there was at least a 1/3 of a can of whipped cream on top. Who's complaining? *cricket noises*

"Looking for good lunch spots close to work can be a tricky thing.  Sometimes I randomly stop at a place simply because it's convenient.  Such was the case with Panini Cafe.

I drive past Panini every day on my way home from work and never once was I tempted to try it.  Located in a strip mall it really didn't look like much.  Luckily Panini Cafe is far more than meets the eye.

The interior is simple and clean, nothing too amazing.  It's the food that really makes an impression.  

The menu makes me chuckle a little, due to what some would consider to be misleading item names.  A 'gyro' here is not what you'd expect.  This is Bosnian food and it's delicious.

I ordered a meat and onion 'pita.'  I paid a little over six bucks for the pita and a soda and headed back to work.  Opening the box I was surprised at what I saw.

A gigantic loaf of something sat there, smelling like heaven.  This thing was huge.  by huge I mean I could have boarded down a mountain on it.  Piping hot beef, cabbage and onions made up the filling.  The crust was made of Phyllo dough and was perfectly cooked.

This is comfort food at it's best.  The flavor was simple but delicious.  I was able to get two full meals outta this thing.  Two meals, six bucks...

For a rustic treat, give Panini Cafe and Bakery a try.

"When my wife had an accident, my previous mechanic (who doesn't do body repairs) referred me to Penn Automotive. It was our first experience in a car accident so I didn't know what to expect, but working with Penn Automotive made it a not-so-bad experience. A couple months later, I scheduled another visit to make a couple more repairs, which I knew would be costly. They did one of them, and advised that I shouldn't do the other because it wasn't necessary. I appreciated that they didn't just suck money out of my pocket, even though I was willing to pay for the other repair they deemed unnecessary. One month later, I scheduled a safety inspection at Penn Automotive but my car failed the inspection because struts and tie rods needed to be replaced and it also needed wheel alignment. They gave me an estimate for how much these repairs would cost. When they eventually did the repairs, the actual cost was significantly lower than their estimate. They later explained to me that they estimated the cost based on a worst-case scenario but they found some internal parts to be in good shape which saved me about $300. I even paid for less labor hours than was estimated! Very honest folks.

"Unexpected greatness.

So we had business to attend to in the area, and I had heard they replaced the Eggsmart with a pretty decent dinner place.  I also knew they served brunch (from 9-4!), and it was 12:30, so I figured we'd walk by and see how crazy it is.  Because we all know that brunch places on a Sunday in Toronto can have line-ups out the door, even the not-so-good places.

All the pros:
- no line-up.  Lots of seats.
- had a Starbucks coffee in my hand. Asked if I should throw it out; server said of course not, keep it.  Big points.
- Quick, efficient, friendly, amazing service from our Ryan Philippe-look-alike server.  
- I ordered two dishes because I'm a glutton.  I had the grilled cheese - perfect bread, toasted perfect, three cheeses, perfect size.  I also had the chocolate banana bread french toast - with caramel sauce all over the place.  Served piping hot.  This was like the best thing ever, and I'm really not a sweet-brunch person.  I usually prefer savoury dishes.
- grapefruit mimosas or orange. Grapefruit went well for brunch.
- nice bathrooms
- great pricing - each dish $10-14.  

All the cons:
- not next door to where I live

"If you don't thoroughly enjoy peanuts, get the hell out of this bar!

The Loft is a multi-level bar with an upstairs with countless booths and a long ""pickup window"" at the center of the bar, as well as a somewhat-hidden basement with a more standard bar setup. The memory of this place I will have of this place years after I move on from my college lifestyle is the abundance of peanuts in this place. It's amazing how rapidly people devour peanuts and throw the shells on the ground.

They always have specials going on, so beer here is cheap. I don't think it's a douchey bar, but you will find your douche bag types here every now and then.

Bartenders here are either hit or miss. The bartenders upstairs were only average -- my friends didn't like one in particular -- while the bartender in the basement was amazing. Drinks are strong and tasty, just how alcohol should be.

Needless to say our suite ended up being the party suite for our group of 12, since everyone else went the other route and stayed at the Hilton. (Ugh.)

"Just making a reservation at this hotel can be very deceiving to begin with. We booked for a ""non-smoking"" room specifically seeing that my husband and I have allergies. But at check in conveniently they only wanted to shove us the ""smoking"" room saying that they were all out of rooms. 
Ideally good customer care will want to help out customers seeing that they have a HUGE hotel with so many rooms. We checked in on a Wednesday night .. okay I understand Vegas can be busy any day but a good customer service is ""accommodative"" to its customers to display good customer service. 
But this place was completely UNHELPFUL and showed us no interest in helping us out with any sort of upgrade or room change. We infact had 2 rooms booked and we are a returning customer. 
Definitely not coming back after such a unfriendly and unaccomodative behavior. We certainly have more nicer hotels to visit in Vegas ... Treasure Island is the not the only hotel to stay in Vegas. They need to do a better job in being friendlier to their customers ... else it's a matter of time they loose out to so many other competitors out on the strip!",1.0

"The casino and room was amazing. The girl who checked us in was professional and very nice. She even upgraded our room since it was our 5 year anniversary. My husband and I really enjoyed everything about the hotel, except for a visit we had in the TI To Go shop. We were on our way back to our room and decided to stop in for a Krispy Kreme. Well as my husband was getting the donuts the box collapsed on him and two donuts fell to the floor. Your employee Carol (is what her name tag said) The receipt says Carolina) saw the whole thing happen and knew it was an accident, but instead of being courteous and understanding she was extremely rude. She told my husband to throw the two donuts away as he was apologizing. Then she walked up to the case and grabbed the box from my husbands hands. She then proceeded to very sternly tell him how he was doing it wrong and wouldn't allow him to get the donuts. She got them instead. I might add we had not been drinking what so ever, and nor were acting crazy. It was an honest mistake and she made my husband feel so stupid. After she got the donuts she gave him the box and we were ready to check out. She walked up to the counter and didn't say a word. She wouldn't even make eye contact with us. She was extremely rude and literally said nothing to us. I was absolutely appalled at her behavior. I understand she probably gets a lot of crazy people in and out through her shifts, but we were not one of them, and if she can't handle what the job throws at her then she should get a new one. The way she acted you would of thought we came in belligerent and knocked the whole case down. She is an extremely rude and unprofessional person. She does not deserve to have her job with the attitude she has. I work in customer service and if one of my employees would of behaved in this manner they would be gone. Someone really needs to have a stern talking to with her. Other than that your hotel was lovely and my husband and I would definitely stay there again.",3.0
"This establishment is located in the Monte Carlo shops in the back of the casino next to the food court. Prices were normal for a gourmet cupcake. We bought it for a friend's birthday and we didn't get around to eating it until 2-3 days later, but even then the cupcake was sooo MOIST still. That's definitely a good sign! I was expecting it to be hard and crusty... not at all! Love it! I would come back here if I was a local. We tried Red Velvet, some chocolate kind, a lemon flavor one and i can't remember the 4th one. But the Red Velvet was my favorite! Delish!",4.0
"Wanted to get my A/C ready for the summer and thought it would be best to have it serviced, my time is very limited and when calling around, I was unable to find a company to come out when it was convenient for me.  

I called Emergency Air conditioning and Heating and they were able to come out the same day.  Chris was very helpful on the phone and arrived on time.  Before they began their work they explained what they were going to do-asked if we had any questions.

One thing that impressed me was they wore cloth covers on their shoes upon entering my home-at all times their shoes were covered as to not dirty my carpet!   

Efficient, clean, detailed and great customer service-and it did not break the bank.  I was surprised at how affordable they are and will continue to use them whenever needed.",5.0
"TOCA itself is not a bad place at all, it's the physicians who are terrible.

I was a patient there for my lower back, neck and shoulder-blade pain. (The pain was all over, really) I saw Dr. Vivek Mehta and Dr. Christopher Huston. Both were totally incompetent and uncaring.

After several X-RAYS, failed diagnostic test injections, and medications neither doctor could offer a reasonable explanation or diagnosis.

I was told sometimes spinal vertebra just get inflamed and pain results. That diagnoses was absolute crap. I'm only 18 years old. Pain doesn't just come from no where and have no explanation. There is always a cause no matter if you're 18 or 80! Pain is not normal, it's a warning sign that must be addressed.

After, I went to a Chiropractor who did a full spinal X-RAY and discovered I had a pretty bad case of scoliosis cause by a pelvic tilt. This was responsible for all of my pain!

My question is how in the world do two orthopedic physicians not detect scoliosis after taking X-RAYS of their own?

These physicians at TOCA are terrible. I hope you take my story as advice and do not see them. The time i wasted with them only caused my scoliosis, pain and damage to my spine to get worse.",1.0

"Went here yesterday for an end of the year party for our Troop. First off they put us in a party room that was too small for our party so not everyone could even sit down and eat. Then they tried to do party games with our 18 kids and trying to do them in a small corner of the room was ridiculous. Half the kids couldn't even get any tickets or balloon animals.

Now for the food. I've been here 3 times before and this was quite possible the worst the buffet yesterday. First off there was very little selection and the workers told us fat we had to ask for any pizza that wasn't out there. What? You don't have plain cheese or pepperoni pizza in a pizza buffet? Then we asked for a pizza and that took forever to make! We also asked for a second soup (the potato one) and it took almost an hour for them to ""make"" it and then they literally put out one bowl. Not a pot, but enough to fill one bowl. My girls asked if they were going to put out any more desserts (there was a chocolate cake but some idiot had let their child smash all the pieces with the tongs.)  and they said ""no we aren't wasting food."" Seriously? Is this food coming out of their mouth? Not to mention this is Vegas, I can spend $14 and go to a real buffet where I don't have to ask for food to be made and can actually eat more than one slice.

The games were good, most in good repair, the kids always like the rides. However claiming our tickets was a total nightmare. The scanner gun wasn't working. Then we tried to combine 2 cards and she accidentally erased all the credits!!! What?! Then the manager came but didn't know how to put them back on so they gave us paper tickets to go feed into the machine and put back on the card. So because of your mistake I now have to work twice as hard for some cheap toy. You can't just take the card and give me the toy?

Needless to say the kids like it because I don't think they care about anything, but the logistical nightmare of this place is ridiculous. You have multiple people working there that I think are just there to make it seem like there's workers but don't really do anything. For the amount we paid, we will be going elsewhere next time.",2.0

"I'll add my thoughts to what others have already expressed.  The Chandelier is beautifully decorated and sophisticated lounge. One would describe the lounge to see and be seen and which makes an element of people watching all the more interesting. 
The drinks are expensive but delicious and worth the splurge if you want to relax and take in the classy environment. 
The lounge also has live music from Thursday through Sunday nights. On our last visit, during Labor Day weekend, Mark & The Martinis were performing and they did an excellent job of providing good entertainment. They sung old school songs from the Rat Pack which gave it an old classy Vegas vibe. People in the lounge were singing along and having a good time. 
As usual, the bartenders provided exceptional service. They may get a little slow when they are really busy but not to the point where it's obnoxious and will acknowledge that they will be right with you. 

Good times!",5.0
"FUN! I was here for a convention at the hotel and we wrapped it up with a few rounds at the Chandelier. Bartenders were attentive, knowledgeable, chatty, and fast. The waitresses were equally pleasant. crowd was cool; old young, CEO's and weekend partiers all shared the same space and intermingled. Not a stuck up person in the house. It lost a star because, 1. the music is pretty loungy and 11oclock hits and everyone is waiting for the uptick that never happens. 2. It seems like  a stopover place for  Marquee, so around 1130 the place empties out and loses some energy. Still, it was fun, and welcoming to the business traveler that shows up alone and the group of long time friends, alike.",4.0
"I love it here, it is just soooo beautiful! Strings and strings of chandeliers everywhere, its just gorgeous, I think its the way the lights hit them.

Either a victory shot for winning his bets or a drink to make him feel better (last few times have been victories (=, luckily ) They make a good drink here and service is great and you can't help but feel a little fancy when your in here. There is three levels and tons of little nooks and cranies for you to explore and sit and have a drink. You can sit at the bar our they even have little cozy chairs so it feels a little romantic at times. Sure its a little pricey but I think your paying for an experience and the ambiance for sure.

"This was my first time here and I have to say, I must be really spoiled from the great Mexican food in Los Angeles, because the food here had NO flavor!!  I ordered the chicken tostada shell and although there was a lot of chicken, it had zero flavor and was really dry.  My husband had the huevos ranchos (I will give them one star for that meal), my Mom ordered the nachos, which were okay, Dad ordered the Botana 'Papa Chencho' (an appetizer) that looked great, but again...the food had no flavor-as in, NO seasoning at all and the meat (chicken and beef) both were really dry.  

I would guess anyone could swing a dead cat and hit a better Mexican restaurant than this place. Seriously though, with all the awards and five star reviews, this place is a huge disappointment and WAY overpriced.

The second star is for the excellent wait staff.  I feel bad that their tips may suffer for the awful food.

On a side note, the restaurant wasn't very clean.  Needless to say, I will not be returning.",2.0
"Been here a few times for lunch, and stopped in for a pastry another few times.  Service has always been quick enough to suit me. 

While it is called a Bakery, and they specialize in a delightful assortment of pies, and cakes, and cookies, and more; they also have a good selection for lunch.  I've had bot the New Orleans Poboy and the California Club.  I cannot attest to the authenticity of the poboy, but I can attest to it's quality.  It was a large sandwich, full of chicken and sausage.  Not greasy at all, and well seasoned.  The California Club got its name (i assume) from the liberal use of avocado.  The Club was delicious and I would strongly recommend it to anyone.  For sides I've tried the macaroni and cheese and the haluski.  The mac and cheese was a bit disappointing.  The sauce was on the runny side, and tasted a bit generic.  On the other hand, the haluski was excellent.

Their deserts are absolutely wonderful.  Their carrot cake is worth devouring, as are their lemon coconut bars.  The only complaint about their peanut butter brownie is that it might be too rich to finish in one sitting (is that really a complaint?).  I never leave there without having a snicker-doodle cookie also.

I cannot attest to their coffee, but their iced tea is quite good.  It is fresh brewed, fairly frequently.  

In nicer weather, they have a few tables and chairs out front.  While there isn't much to look at but a parking lot and rt19, its always nice to have somewhere you can enjoy a cigarette while you wait for your food.",4.0

"Honestly, just don't bother with this place.  I've been to this place 3 times over the course of working in Liberty Village and in my honest opinion this place doesn't hold up.

1st off, I have to get this off my plate.  While I acknowledge that they are places that only accept cash, it's typically in areas where a bunch of vendors will come together and not accept cash.  Pho Asia 21, on the other hand still ONLY accept cash, where everywhere else accepts at the bare minimum debit card (and also credit card).  But I digress...

Let me get through the positives before I go into the negatives because there are so highlights.  

The dish, I ordered (#104L (medium) - Pho Tai (beef tendon / rare beef), the noodles were cooked to my liking, a small bite but not undercooked.  The tendon itself was cooked very well and a massive improvement from the 1st time I went where the tendon was hard, unclean and an unpleasant aftertaste.  This time, it was cooked all the way through and melt in your mouth (really good).  The beef was ok, but considering it's rare beef it came cooked all the way through but I didn't mind...tasty beef.

And....that's about all I have to say with the positives.

So, service wise.  As attentive as he was (there wasn't a whole lot of customers), I wasn't provided any tea at all (a slight irritation but since I wasn't in the mood for tea, I kind of let it slide and asked for water instead, during my meal).  Overall, he did his job well and brought the food in a timely manner.  Heck, even knew when I needed the check, he had it ready (not sure if that's just him wanting me to leave or just good intuition, I'll leave that for you to decide).

The dish I had as mentioned while there were good points, the broth...ugh...it's definitely laced in MSG.  Hence probably why I asked for that glass of water because while it tasted great at first, I could feel it on my tongue the desire to drink water like ASAP...that rather uncomfortable numb feeling that I get from my tongue. 

3rd off, call me picky or whatever but I just can't stand when there are flies flying around in the restaurant.  It makes me wonder whether the dish I'm eating is clean and the fact that I have to be constantly air-swatting my food to keep the fly away just gives me another unpleasant feeling about this place.

My last point, and this isn't necessarily a negative (well kind-of) but pricing wise, it's $0.50 - $1.00+ more expensive than the regular pho places I go to and offer up better quality than this place produces.  Their largest bowl is $10.50 which is absolutely massive and ridiculous when it's like $1.50 cheaper elsewhere.  

I was hoping for this place to improve, espeically over the number of years that it's been business but honestly, I give up...find somewhere else.",2.0
"I recently came back from a trip to Japan and after 2 weeks on a sushi/ramen diet, guess what I was craving? Sushi. Unfortunately the sushi restaurant was closed that evening so I went for the next best thing - ramen! 
 
I heard goods thing about Ryu's Noodles so I thought it was a good time to check it out since I was already in the area. I order the Shoyu dip noodle and it honestly the best I ever had! The noodles were cooked al dente and the dipping sauce was thick enough to stick to the noodles but not overly concentrated & salty. The order comes with deeeelious sides like bamboo, pork and sous vide chicken. If you haven't tried this method of preparing chicken, you're in for a very pleasant surprise. 
 
I also had a taste of the pork blaster ramen...soup was tasty and again, not overly salty. This order comes with a lot of melt-in-your-mouth pork so make sure you order this on a very empty stomach.

"There's nothing quite like walking the Strip and getting a sudden brain freeze from a Fat Tuesday.

This particular location is located in the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood. It also is one of the more popular locations, so expect a wait.

My cousins and I came by on a late Thursday afternoon, and there was no wait fortunately.

I decided to grab their "".44 Magnum"" (Hurricane and 190 Octane) with an extra shot in their Yard Dog size. I don't know if it was just because my alcohol tolerance was low or whatever, but whoa, did that give me a good buzz. And for $15, a pretty cheap one!

Their .44 Magnum in particular has a mellow orange flavor. If you don't prefer a strong alcohol ""flavor,"" I'd suggest straying from this flavor just because the alcoholic taste is pretty strong.

However, if you're looking for a quicker buzz, definitely add that extra shot. It's only $1!

"ATTENTION VEGAS-TOURISTS:  A WORD ABOUT ""LAVO""
I've been to Lavo a few times - mostly because other less-experienced parties have dragged me there.  As someone that's actually partaken of their services as a guest, (as opposed to being an employee of Lavo like most of the recent reviews on this site [ahem]) let me be the one to tell you:

-- Some of the claims made by these 5-star-reviewing, Lavo Employees are at least, supernaturally inflated and at most, just patentedly false. 

Lavo's kind of a sad place that appears to have spent an inordinate amount of cash on decor, architecture & efforts to reinvigorate a club/restuarant that never really took off since its inception.  It's like the stepchild of Tao which is a less-than-authentic Asian club/restaurant as well but is really popular with us members of the Asian crowd making it a destination club for tourists and, to a nauseating degree, other guys that simply like hounding Asian women.

But unfortunately, Lavo doesn't even have that going for it.  If Tao is the Dr. Evil of Night Clubs, Lavo is like Mini Me:  It's tiny and not really useful for anything.

Here's a few things to consider:

-- 15 FAKE REVIEWS:  Their staff appears to have posted an onslaught of clearly artificial 5-star reviews from 0/1 people who'd never visited Yelp before over a span of a week, (Look at the reviews between 7/8 - 7/13)  I assume because Lavo can't get any of their real patrons to post positive experiences.

-- LESS THAN 3-STARS:  They've got an average of 3-stars across 120+ reviews when you filter out the one-and-dones.  In fact, prior to their desperate & fraudulent review posts, the club was trending DOWNWARD below their historical average of 3-stars.

-- TINY:  I love how the fake reviews of this place try to spin this as a positive.  The first time I walked in to Lavo, it was on a Friday & I was reminded of the famed movie quote, ""You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.""  As I passed the predominantly male, sweaty & oversexed crowd, I realized that part of what really turned me off was how Lavo was just 'ultra lounge' size but was trying to be a 'nightclub' big.  The bottom line is that Lavo's diminutive size means that there's really nowhere to escape the Affliction shirt-donning, Axe-bodyspray wearing, frosted tips-sporting guys with tribal arm band tattoos & tattered jeans.  There's always gonna be some liquored up dude listening in on your conversation and butting in to say, ""HeyhowYOUdoin'?""  So have fun ladies.

-- WEAK SAUCE CUISINE:  Lavo's original menu was probably so poorly received they scrapped the whole Mediterranean theme for an Italian one. (Because we all love jumping up & down to hiphop after eating a starchy meal of pasta, right?)  They appear to have kept the kitchen intact because I've had both menus & the menu items appear interesting but the resulting food is consistently mediocre. Jesus Lavo:  How can you f'up Linquini & Clam Sauce?  Better yet, how do you not serve lasagna at an Italian restaurant?

-- GHOST TOWN:  I've been dragged to Lavo on two occasions where there was nobody & I mean NOBODY around.  Get ready for a similar experience if you go any day other than Friday or Saturday, and on those days, it's...

-- SAUSAGE CITY:  On the nights that there are actually people there, the club has a very oddly slanted ratio toward guys.  Basically, it's clear this isn't where the hooked up ladies want to be for whatever reason.  (The Palazzo's ladies must be going to a club where things are done 'right', like across the bridge at Encore's XS)  To be honest, it's mostly amateur night in the club which kind of makes sense when you consider most of the overflow from Tao, i.e. folks that have no hookup or are noobs to Vegas club scene, matriculates to Lavo.

-- TOP 40:  Hope you like MTV ""TRL-esque"" music like Lady Gaga, Flo Rida, Ne-Yo, and everything else they play ad nauseum on  Power106 in LA because they're gonna play it over and over and over again until it's burned into your cranium, repeating the same Top 40 music every 30-60 minutes.


Only one positive:
The only reason they get an extra star is the decor is VERY pretty and it's clear that a lot of money's been put into it.  Whomever their designer is gets two thumbs up for having a very elegant touch and a knack for lighting.  That being said, they misfired on virtually everything else.  Music, food, crowd flow.  Their service is frankly a crapshoot:  I've had attentive, smiling waiters there, and I've had complete morons serving us, or should I say, FORGETTING ABOUT US.  Hopefully, they'll someday get their act together but as of right now, their staff clearly does not 'hum' together as one unit.

"I recently spent five righteous days at The Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas between Christmas and New Year's Eve. On the 1st night, I was hanging out with my Family at the 'Imperial Bar', a suggestion was made to go check out 'LAVO'. We walked in and was seated readily by the highly courteous Waitstaff. We ordered a Massive meatball with Ricotta cheese,  a 4-Cheese Pizza, and some soup - we just wanted to keep it simple for this initial visit. While we were waiting, we were given garlic bread with marinara sauce to nibble upon while waiting for the sumptuous meal to come. During our wait, one of the Managers came over and spent a few minutes to greet us, his name was Francis and he recommended that we head over to 'TAO' Nightclub over at The Venetian Hotel. The food arrived and at the first taste I can honestly say this is some of the Absolute Best Italian fare that I have had in several years. 

We feasted heartily and then expeditiously trekked over to 'TAO' and saw multitudes of folks trying to get in, only to be consistently shot down in their attempts by gain entry by a platoon of Bouncers who were keeping them at bay with great ease - Considering this scene, it did not seem possible that we would gain entry. We ended up being given access in less than 4 minutes just at the mention of Francis's name - what we experienced inside can only be described as a scene that one would only see in a movie - it was spectacular!!! What a wild conclusion to a most flavorful evening!!! 

We made a 2nd visit to 'LAVO' prior to flying out of Vegas, and the ambience along with the food was superior, as it was the first time! I cannot say enough about the customer service they provided, the Waitstaff delivers excellence with a smile every time!!

When I return to Las Vegas, i will be going back to 'LAVO' as the 1st stop on my list. It was excellent experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for Outstanding Italian food in Las Vegas !!!!",5.0

Highlights: the garlic bread and the service.  We were about to order WAY too much food and our server stopped us in our tracks.  He saved us a ton of money and waste - it was greatly appreciated.

Lowlights: the famous meat ball - good but not fabulous and the salmon was fishy.  

With all the great restaurants in Vegas this is not worth it.",2.0
"Whenever we come to Vegas, we make sure to stop here for breakfast. Everything tastes phenomenal and the amazing breakfast potatoes top it all off. All of the staff has been great!

"I've tried both Wongs and I can say with certainty that I prefer Big Wong.

Since Big Wong closed, I heard that Peter Wong (her brother's place) is fairly similar but I don't think they even come close. When I arrived for dinner, I noticed the decor was very dated. They still had decoration up from the 80s. There was also a mini stage available for wedding, if anyone is interested. 

There were two other parties there but no host was to be seen. It appears to me that there was only the mother/son team working the kitchen and the front of the house. So service was slow all night.

We ordered: deep-fried tofu, stuffed with shrimp; orange flavored chicken and honey walnut shrimp but I was told that they ran out of the sauce for the walnut shrimp (which was mayonnaise) so I switched that out for the roasted duck.

The deep fried tofu was missing a lot of shrimp and by a lot, I mean ""stuffed"" was used loosely on the menu. The roasted duck was heated up in the kitchen because there were pieces that were refrigerator cold. The orange flavored chicken was missing flavor. 

Gordon Ramsey and his Kitchen Nightmare team need to visit this place. I know the owner is a nice person and her son, looks like he hates working here and probably only doing it to help his family out.",1.0
"Stayed here on 2/15/14 for 1 night.  I wish I would have stayed here the whole 5 days I was in Vegas.  I had been Downtown since 2/11 but they could not accommodate me the last night.  Was able to cash In points at the last minute to get a room on a busy holiday weekend.

Had room 104 and it was beautiful.  Yes it was a handicapped accessible but it was the only room they had.  Room was spotless and loved the little walk out patio this room offered.  If I would have had time I would have sit out there all day and soak up the sun!

As with a typical Courtyard they have breakfast and dinner in the lobby along with the Market and a small bar.  Coffee and water in the lobby for free along with the free Wi-Fi.  

They also offer a free one way shuttle to Mandalay Bay, Town Center and the Airport!  They deserve a 5 star just for that!  

Staff were extremely friendly and efficient and appeared to LOVE their job.

The only negative is that there are no restaurants to walk to.  Probably 1/2 mile walk to Terrible's Gas Station if you wanted gas station food!  

I would stay here again in a minute but I go to Casinos in Vegas so it kinda don't work out.  However I know this is my goto hotel the next time I don't wish to go to a Casino!",5.0

"This quaint cafe sure stays true to its name. First of all it's located on a strip that resembles that of a little winter village. When you walk inside you find yourself stepping into a ""cottage"" with antique-like, cottage-y decor, complete with a creaking wooden floor. 

I visited today because of so many rave reviews regarding their ""amazing butter tarts"" so I was curious. I wasn't overly hungry so I ordered the minestrone ""soup du jour"" and my favorite butter tart - PECAN! 

I sat at the back of the room by the window. My table was the kind you would have found at grandma's with tied-on chair cushions. It was pretty empty but for those who were there, they appeared to be regulars as the staff knew them by name, small town-like. :) 

The minestrone soup wasn't anything special, obviously homemade but definitely not Italian authentic. But i'm was not expecting that from this place. Once that was down the hatch I was ready for the infamous tart!

On looks alone, it didn't wow me and i'm pretty particular about my tarts so I was hoping that the hype was all it was cracked up to be.

Cutting into it with my fork was my first test. I don't like the filling to spill out, I like a more gelatinous texture. Pass!

I liked the thicker pie crust encasing the filling. It was both equal parts buttery, crisp and chewy. Texture love!

Now the filling was smooth, rich and sweet, with the perfect hints of pecans. After devouring it, I had a short argument with my hips and thighs about ordering a second. My hips and thighs won, this time!

Besides Pecan, they have many other choices for tarts as well as biscuits and muffins and other desserts. Any ""defective"" desserts are on display for purchase at a discount and they have coolers filled with Ready-to-serve and frozen entrees to take home. Great for the bachelor in me!

As others would have it said, Yes, place makes a pretty scrumptious tart. I'll have to come back and taste test the others.",4.0
Two guys came in to my work at the absolute perfect time! Both of my vehicles had chips that needed to be fixed and I was about to call my insurance company myself to get it all taken care of but they basically took care of everything in a quick and professional manner! The first of my two cars was just repaired and it looks phenomenal! I told the guys to come back ever so often to check in because living in AZ chips are unavoidable. Thank you to everyone for your professionalism and your speedy service.,5.0
"I'm giving Showmars 5 stars compared to other fast food places, but Showmars is more than just a fast food place.   The servers here are very friendly and even though it was noon and the place was very busy, I received my to go order quickly.  I got the gyro pita & fries ($5.75) along with an order of onion rings.  The gyro was pretty typical and very tasty.  It had lots of tomatoes a few onions and tzatziki sauce.  The fries are crinkle cut and a nice portion cooked crispy just the way I like them.  I got a large order of onion rings and by large they mean enormous!  It must have been close to entire onion in the styrofoam takeout box that was full.  The rings were the frozen variety, but tasty never the less.  I would definitely go to Showmars over other fast food places.",5.0

"I've had a turkey club & fries here before and really enjoyed it. Today I ordered the open face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes. It wasn't really all that yummuy. For starters, it isn't even that big. One piece of bread & only one piece of turkey on top. I would've been a little more satisfied if there were two pieces of bread rather than one but whatever. The potatoes were good though. You can tell they're homemade with chunks of potato inside- just like my mom used to make. I finished the meal in under 5 minutes b/c of how small it was and waited awhile for my check. My server wasn't mean, but she did seem kind of weird to me since I first sat in the ""take out"" section. She kind of snapped at me and said to move down because the section was closed and pointed to the teeny tiny sign stated this. She was extremely friendly with other patrons but was really short with me.. blehh i dont know. I only come here like once every 6 months when i'm over the normal downtown lunch fare.  I'll stick with the turkey club or their burgers. Two stars are for the other servers who seemed really friendly to their customers decent prices for lunch",2.0
"I have no complaints about Fat Heads. Honestly, I can't think of one negative from my dinner there last night. There was a bit of a wait for a table so my husband and I got a drink at the bar. Huge beer menu, including many house brews! If you like ales, this is the place for you.. They told us 30 min for our wait, but it was only 15. Perfect.

The service was very prompt. We had drinks within 5 minutes, ordered our appetizers, and those were out within 10 min. We were never without a beverage and the waitress checked on us just enough times. 

 Most of their menu, including sauces, dressings, chili and soups is home made. You can tell by the flavors. The pulled pork chili was so good that I almost ordered another bowl. I wanted to stick my face into the bowl and get every last drop. My husband had the spinach and artichoke dip and felt the same way. Appetizer plates were licked clean!

We both opted for wings. He got the classic fried in Extra medium (like a wet cajun) and garlic parmesan. They were HUGE. He had no problem putting away 14 of them, though. I got the slow smoked, chargrilled whole wings because they are gluten free (and soy free!). Holy moly. They fell off the bone but still had super crispy skin. I got the Carolina sauce which is an amazing tangy (well, Carolina style) BBQ sauce with hints of honey mustard, vinegar and cumin. I asked for more sauce because they lightly brush them. I wanted my wings doused in this stuff because it was so good. 

Overall, I cannot wait to come back! Their gluten free menu is gigantic and also includes GF buns, baguettes, and a wide selection of their menu, including apps, can be made gluten free. Just ask for a menu at the front!",5.0

"This coffee shop is confortable, tastefully decorated and well located. Staff is friendly and the coffee is great. But the music is so loud, this place is noisier than some bars.

It is a pity, because some classic jazz in the background would make this an unbeatable place.",3.0

Some great prime rib! Wasn't too sure about this place when I drove by but then I whipped out my iPhone and opened my handy dandy Yelp app and sure enough there it was with all those reviews. Place is very nice outside and very clean both inside and out! Walked in and was greeting right away by the hostess. 5-10 min wait at 8pm on Saturday night. We got seated and within minutes our server comes over. Mrs.Taylor (who was the best server I have ever had in a long long long time) greeted us with open arms and explained how the whole place and ordering works. The bread and butter was so fresh crispy and tasty. The salad was very fresh and light and the dressing was pretty tasty. It was tossed table side which was interesting. Now to the prime rib. I ordered a 10 oz medium well. When it was cut and handed to me it was a little overcooked for my taste. Mrs Taylor actually spotted it and right away brought out a brand new one. It was much better. It was flavorful juicy and more. Potatoes were a little bland for my taste but with a little salt and pepper it was spot on. Overall Yelp didn't let me down. I love the old world charm of this place. From what the servers are wearing to the music to the old fashion cart cutting the meat. Please please ask for Mrs Taylor she is beyond awesome!,4.0
"I ordered party strays for my dad funeral. Their  foods was so disgusting.  Egg rolls was black for over cook, a lot greasy in fried rices, Vietnamese salad tasted like sugar...

I never go back there again.",1.0
"It took me a few years to discover this restaurant since they look a little sketchy from the outside. A coworker dragged me into Lupie's 3 years ago and I have been a fan ever since. The only negative to this restaurant is that they are closed on Sundays.  Just like with Chick Fil A, I always end up wanting Lupie's on Sundays when I am working weekends.  

I have had their burgers and their nachos and both are to die for.  If you eat normal sized portions, you may want to share the nachos with a friend because they are enormous.  I have never finished even half of my plate of nachos! 

The service is speedy and the staff are always friendly.  Parking can be a little touch and go if you come during a busy time.",4.0
"I'm on the hunt for long stem white orchids to create an $800 arrangement that my co-worker has fallen in love with for her dining room table.  Eight. Hundred. Dollars. folks, yep, you read that right.  After much online searching and asking all my acquaintances if they have a silk flower hook up I finally decide that I'm gonna have to tackle this myself.  

I first visited my local Michael's to see what they offered and was disappointed in their selection.  I understand that it's nearing the fall season, but I do not need sunflowers and fall foliage for this gift, I need white orchids which Michael's didn't have.  So off to Golden State Flowers I go.  I prepare myself for the hot warehouse experience that always awaits, and I'm not disappointed...  it's 90 degrees outside and I start to sweat as soon as I entered the warehouse.  I go over to where I know the white flowers are and I find exactly what I need.  Boxes of beautiful long stemmed white silk orchids.  Wow.  They are lovely.  They have some that are shorter, but for this project, it needs to make a statement, it needs to be amazing so I got an unopened box that contained 6 pristine white stems.  I then get a couple of the leaves complete with roots attached and some moss to cover the foam and a large round glass container.  This thing is gonna be a freakin' show stopper!  Then I realize I don't have the correct credit card with me; I can't purchase this stuff on the wrong card so I ask the very kind lady if she'll hold my items while I run back to work to get the correct credit card and she agreed to hold them for me.  I think she was surprised when I came back... she was SO helpful it blew my mind!  She was telling me where to place the moss to make it look realistic and how to cut the foam so it would fit my container best.  OMG!  How fantastic and unexpected is that?!?  So at the end of my very sweaty shopping experience I walk out having spent just under $100 and will tonight produce an arrangement that would cost me nearly 8 times as much to purchase online AND I'd have to wait for it to be created and shipped to me.

Thank you so much lady from Golden State Silk Flowers...  thank you for helping me attain my gift giving goal without killing my budget  :-)  I won't forget your kindness, I will definitely be back  :-)",4.0

"We would not recommend this company at all.
 Rob came out to give us an estimate, told us about repairs needed, which we felt was very overpriced. $170 to replace three pool lights in a drained pool when we are supplying the bulbs? 
We asked for an itemized quote to be emailed to us, Rob said he would send it that night, and he never did.
Then we called him again the next day, spoke to Rob, scheduled for them to drain our pool and confirmed with them the same day, and they never showed up, called or emailed. 
Unprofessional and as business owners ourselves, we would never conduct ourselves this way and expect to be successful or referred. 
Then we called Rob again  the next morning, and he didn't answer or have the professional courtesy to explain why they stood us up on the pool drain.
You try to give business to the local little guy, and then this happens.

After the manager had to threaten to call the cops she settled down and after the shakes and sweats stopped, we were able to enjoy the best damn tacos we have had in a loooong time. The salsa bar kicks ass and we mixed a few together to get even better sauces. I do recommend this place to everyone, but not Guy Fieri. He's a dick and almost ruined our vacation.",5.0

"misleading or unclear information on their website regarding pricing. price at stations is not stated on website. beware if you purchase tics for other people, they have a price increase in effect. the monorail itself is great if it goes where you are going. otherwise just cab it. their customer service lacks a little to be desired. very defensive when i tried to discuss website issues. unfortunate how one representative can taint your view of an organization....keep this in mind next time a customer calls....

followup a year later: my son was out here for a few days and we went to the strip, parked at mgm took monorail down to harrahs station. we must have missed the sign (if there was one) saying they were closing at midnight. at 12:02 we discovered we missed the last train (actually us and a bunch of other people) and instead of a $1 ride on the monorail it was a $10 cab back to mgm. sent them a message the next day and to my surprise they replied, apologized for the inconvenience and offered to reimburse my cab expense and a free annual pass....yeah, right...NOT...same as before, no reply says they still don't care.

with my gripes out of the way here is a more complete review - first it is a LONG walk back to the monorail stations. seems slightly less than walking to where you want to go but it is mostly inside and/or covered so either warm or cool depending on the time of the year, that's a plus. the trains and stations are clean and the wait is usually not very long. signs are clear so easy to navigate. if you want to go to the convention center convenient parking at harrahs, mgm or sahara and take the train. sometimes the escalators are not working and it is a LONG walk up/down the stairs to get to ground level. also the handrails at the convention center stop have a tendency to leave your hands soiled. it would get 5 stars no matter what else if it went downtown or to the airport....sadly no. if you are going to the wynn, or sands convention center be prepared for a long walk from the nearest station which i think is harrahs. i am not sure why but the entrance gates are not real intuitive, you will set off sirens if you do it wrong. kind of funny. my problem is after riding bart for years, it keeps your ticket when it is empty, not lvmonorail, you have to take the empty ticket out and throw it away yourself (ahh sirens.)  for locals it is a good value, thats why they earned the second star. (except when they close early and don't tell you!)",2.0
"As per my cousin, this is the best sport bar in North Amercia.  

Normally I'm not a fan of sport bar but decided to go just to see ""the best sport bar in North Amercia"" myself.  I was presently astonish by how good the food quality was.  Yum...

As a bonus, it's a great spot to spot cute boys too!! ;)",4.0
"When I read the website saying they were the best sports bar in North America (as decided by ESPN), I was kinda skeptical. I mean, how awesome can a sports bar be? Well this bar is pretty awesome. They've got a massive large screen above the bar that can be seen from pretty much anywhere in the two-storey bar, and a ton of other screens around the place so you never miss out on any sports channel action. The seating is comfortable, it's spacious and clean, and they've got a neat blue ticker-tape that runs along the bar showing sports news. 

I showed up to meet some friends around 4pm on a Raptors game night, and the place was crazy packed. Except, it wasn't crazy packed. There were tons of people standing around waiting for a table, but there were also tons of empty tables inside. I suspect they didn't have enough servers per customers, but it seemed really strange when we were standing around waiting for over 40 minutes when there were quite a few free tables around. 

By the time we finally got seated, we were put in a remote area where no one was, and our waitress would only pop by every now and then to take orders, and never to see how we're doing. We asked for some drinks and she'd disappear for 15 minutes and then come back without some of them, so we had to remind her again. The food was decent - I had a burger and my friend had the cajun shrimp. Their beers were reasonably priced, and they did well to handle our large party. 

Overall, it was an alright experience. The place itself is worth the visit just to see the screens. I can imagine it would get a bit crazy on game nights (we left before the Raps game started). But I'd try again on a non-game night and hopefully I'll have better service.",3.0

This may have taken the spot of my favorite brunch spot in Pittsburgh (food wise). 
Came in on a Saturday around 12 for brunch with a reservation. Place was pretty calm and not packed but our waiter said that brunch for them is mainly busiest on Sunday's. 

Our waiter was AWESOME. My friends both got the bottomless mimosas and I got the Bloody Mary bar. At no point did we have to ask for more mimosas he just kept them coming! And the Bloody Mary bar was second best I have experienced. First is definitely Meat and Potatoes.

"Meat and potatoes delivered neither of the aforementioned, although there were plenty cockroaches and a rat to serenade us on our night out in the Burgh. To avoid ruining the hip vibe inside we were placed outside (we have a 2 year old and she's so. not. hip) where we waited and waited and waited some more for appetizers, some flatbread, and a ricotta that never saw the light of day. Clearly we ordered the most time-intensive meals on the menu. Although beverages came out as expected, we were quickly forgotten outside and left waiting until I made my way to the front desk and asked for a check. The server came out and actually asked if we were still enjoying our beverages after being told by the front desk we were upset (and beverages being beyond empty). Interesting. I asked for the manager and she comped the drinks and was quite pleasant considering the situation, but there's something about making my child wait for food that infuriates me. There is nowhere else in this city where I've experienced such lackluster service and poor ambience (when building a restaurant avoid placing your patio along the alley filled with garbage disposal units).

"House of Window Coverings has no concept of Customer Service! We walked into the store after getting a quote from Lowes for shutters and gave the quote to Alina Dima. We received a  quote for shutters 2,000.00 less than Lowes, so we thought this was great news; however, after they came out measure the windows the quote changed to more than the one Lowes had given us.  After speaking with Alina and letting her know that House of Window Coverings was now more than Lowes,  Alina was able to come down on the price.  { This should have been a red flag}

We went ahead and went with House of Window Coverings because we wanted to support a local business.  { BIG MISTAKE} The shutters came in and one was to small and two others we not closing properly. The shutter that was to small took 8 weeks to get and the other two that don't close properly will take another 8 weeks.  My sales rep. Alina Dima has been missing since she got the check for payment- You won't hear from her again! So if you have a problem don't count on her for help.  I left a message for the  owner {Chris} to call me, but he won't return your call either. The business has no commitment to Customer Service! If you have a problem don't expect any help from the store because you won't get it. 

My advice is to take your business somewhere else! It's not worth the headaches!",2.0
"Huge selection of board games. Just coming in and browsing is an experience in and of itself. The employee(s) are definitely enthusiasts and know plenty about most of the games they sell.

Prices are definitely higher than you'll find online, but it's worth it to support a local business. They offer demo's on the weekend of different games. We took part in a demo, and liked the game enough to buy it. 

They also offer game rentals (for a fee) so you can try out a game before buying it. When you bring the game back, the fee becomes a store credit.",5.0
"Walmart and the city of surprise should be ashamed that this store is still open for business. The smell is beyond gross and the employees are forced to work in these conditions. When asked they have been told to say ""we have not been told anything"" is so typical of Walmart. Selling food that has sat around being penetrated by that smell must be illegal. By the way the smell is that of sewage, black water, and gutter all rolled up in one. NEVER EVER EVER GOING BACK.",1.0
"Was here a couple times with a friend this week while visiting Tempe.  It's a very cute place, and right off the beaten path of Mill Ave.

Food was reasonably priced and very good as was the service.  Highly recommend the eggs benedict with avocado on a croissant....to die for!

Not sure why everyone is so judgemental with the bad reviews, every good restaurant will have its occasional hiccups.  We came at off-peak times so not sure how things would have changed if it was super busy but we will be back!!",5.0

"Just wanted to weigh in on an old friend.  
Started going here in 2007 whenever I was in town.  GREAT breakfast  and lunch choices prepared well and quickly.  Nice, healthy, fruit and wholegrain choices and a very friendly atmosphere.  If you're a student, THIS IS where to take the rents! They'll worry less.
(like in most college towns, you can get very bad food in Kent, so be careful).",5.0
"From the outside it looks like a small (maybe scary) dinner. The indoor decor is pretty old and drab, but don't let that stop you from trying them. 

The french onion soup is wonderful! Plenty of warm melted cheese and just the right balance of spices in the broth. They warn you on the menu a bowl could take 20 mins. Don't be surprised if it does take that long, but I've gotten it faster too. I think it probably depends on the orders before yours and how many soups they can do at a time. It's worth the wait.

The only crepes I have tried is the fresh strawberry. It's a decent crepe and you can't really go too wrong with slicing up strawberries and tossing on a little whipped cream. 

Prices are reasonable and the service is pleasant enough. Great place for a light lunch or snack.",4.0
"Surprisingly fresh sushi, WIN. This place is pretty darn good, and to get your money's worth, EAT SASHIMI.
But don't eat the oyster, it's nasty.... No matter what day you have it..
Other than that, I find the sushi to be pretty good. I have no complaints, I like this place. It's pricey, but worth it if you eat a lot of sashimi (or only sashimi) and if you eat a considerable amount... hehe.
AND don't feel guilty for eating so much sashimi! It's healthy!!",4.0

"The cover is a good deal compares to downtown clubs - $10.  The DJ knows how to mix songs and play variety of good tunes.  The crowd is definitely older and mature (as expected).  Dance floor is not big, but good enough for dancing.  Nice decent patio for smokers.  Security and bartenders are nicer without stuck-up attitudes.  When it comes to coat check, the attendant has poor customer service and unattentive. Overall 3/5 decent club to go to, for those who don't have the desire to go downtown to pay high price parking and cover.",3.0
"I loved Nu Nails! I'm in AZ for a month due to work, and when it was time for a fill, I looked on Yelp for the best salon in Scottsdale. I was lucky to find Nu Nails, and even luckier to get an appointment with Tracy! All of the reviews raved about her work, and I can see why. She worked quickly but was very detailed. I keep my acrylic nails long and coffin-shaped, which can be hard to shape evenly. I can honestly say my nails are perfect! I asked her for an opinion on the best nude polish, and she dug around until I found one that I fell in love with. They also have an AMAZING matte top coat- definitely worth the $5 extra. Tracy was so sweet and fun to talk to. She is usually booked at least a week out, but it is definitely worth the wait! I'll definitely come back to Nu Nails whenever I'm in Scottsdale!",5.0
"Unusually go to the lunch but this time I decided to go to the dinner.

The dinner costs a lot more than the lunch, it's literally twice as much and there's really not much addition to the menu so I suggest going to the lunch!!!

I love the sushi here, I'm not a fan of raw sushi but rolls like the California roll, spicy crab roll, mango roll and shrimp tempura roll are to die for! Absolutely love them!

Although it sounds weird the sushi pizza is so good! MUST TRY IT! It's just a rice patty and either salmon crabmeat or avocado on top!

I also love the fried rice (ask to get a small portion otherwise it'll be SO much!) and salmon teriyaki is great too

The service is not that great! I mean they're diligent workers but they give off an attitude and sometimes slam your food on your table and leave. It's ridiculous really especially since there's a 10% service charge.

Anyway, I love this place because the food is so good!",4.0

Some people get pretty serious about their surf and boogie sessions here; have even seen guys in their 40s with gopro cams in this wave pool.  Funny stuff, bros.

"The first time I was there I had a really great experience. The two older ladies were kind and help me find what I need. I was just in there recently and this blonde guy with shoulder length hair was trying asking me questions of what I'm taking and keep referring to my friend as a moron. I could accept that he didn't agree but for a business to call someone else a name and insulting them, I did not care for that. Then he went on to stating that the item I was taking should only be taken if I wanted to cough up blood after two months also the ingredient in there is help to treat asthma. First off, my friend and I have been using it for over a year and I am not coughing up blood. Secondly, I do have asthma so I guess the product work well for me and, my friend doesn't have asthma but is still taking it and still not coughing up blood. Then he goes on to preaching how he's so ""knowledgeable"". After that I didn't care to listen to his advice since everything he told me was already bull and I've already done the research before using the pre workout. I most likely won't be coming here again.",1.0
"I was on a business trip in Vegas and craving some good Chinese food. This restaurant is literally just a $12 Uber away from the far end of the strip (Mandalay), and totally worth it. Small hole in the wall, but clean, popular, and great customer service.

"Can't speak about the food, but the bar service, outstanding. 

Yes, they will make fun of you and say sarcastic stupid comments if you ask a question. If you ask for a straw, they will throw it at you. If your stupid enough to ask for it, they will write witty sexual innuendo's on a piece of paper, fold it into a phallic shape, and place it on your head.

It's called Dicks. You knew the risks.

It's not totally like it's counterpart I remember so fondly in San Diego, but it's close enough. I stopped here with some friends while killing time on our way to the Luxor. The consensus was that we were hung over, and the best way to cure a hang over, keep drinking. 

The beers were cheap. Not a huge selection of drafts, but good enough. Best part, 3 dollar Patron shots during the afternoon. This took me to a much better place. If it's 1 pm in the afternoon, and you need to continue your liquid diet, belly up to the bar, say something stupid, and let the magic happen.",4.0

I got a #1 and my cousin got a #6 so I got a taste of both. Both of these were pretty plain, I was still hungry when I left the place. The bread was pretty toasty and crunchy however I wish they would ask us if we want the bread toasted or not because it's really hard to chew on it. My jaw got a workout that wasn't needed. If the bread was softer I probably would have enjoyed my sandwich a little more. I think $8.25 for some salad and a little sandwich that isn't the GREATEST is a bit pricey. 

They have chocolate which is pretty good but also pricey I believe it was $25 a pound. 

I wouldn't go here a second time and if I did I'd try pasta.",3.0
Amazing. Amazing. AMMMMAAAZZZINNNNG!!!!! Here is the deal I spent a year abroad in Florence during college. Loved it. Loved the food. I think Florence is to blame for my foodie ways. A few years back my friend who lives in the valley and also lived in Florence found this place. We went . . . and since then it is one of my favorite places to go. AUTHENTIC. Is the only thing you need to know about this place. From the Italian TV on the station - to the staff (speaking Italian across the counter at each other). This place takes me back to Florence. The sandwiches are amazing. And the desserts . . . well they are delicious. To put all this into context this is a place we will drive 45 minutes across town to for lunch.,5.0
"I came here for a rehearsal dinner while in town and had a lovely experience. The owner Tony and his staff took great care of us. The shared appetizers and desserts were delicious!

Its quite packed on that day, but I can tell that its always busy like that everyday since all the table and chairs are positioned very closed to each other. I dont mind it. I especially dont like breakfast places where it is so quite that make me want to get back to my bed. 
The only thing that make me rate only 4 star is that they dont have a waiting area. So when its too busy, there are a lot of people standing at the door and that is the only way to get into the place as well. 
But I would definitely go back to Eggspectation for breakfast.",4.0
"I went to the free board gaming night.  The place was packed with serious gamers, who were all locals, yet they were very welcoming to a stranger visiting from out of town.  Two local restaurants dropped off samples of pizza and wings to drum up business, which worked, since a bunch of folks placed orders.  While we were playing, a homeless guy showed up for the free samples.  The gamers were kind, invited him to play a game, and after playing & eating, he went on his way.

The staff is knowledgable and friendly.  They have an amazing selection of European style games, especially those featured on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop, but also the more obscure, complicated, and challenging games favored by the serious gamers who were in attendance at the gaming night.

I was ignored while trying to order an appetizer three times, then I was told to hold on in a rude manner so she could serve drinks to another table.

I had read the reviews before but decided to give them a try despite the bad feedback, but unfortunately their is a lot of truth behind the negative comments.

"Such a nightmare! We had been dying to try this place as it has a beautiful curb appeal. So we went recently. Wish we hadn't. Started off with being seated. The booth benches are rickety so when the 5 kids sitting behind us were jumping on their seats, we got to feel all of it. Time to order and we put in breakfast orders. Coffee came out luke warm. I ordered my eggs scrambled well, they were still running all over my plate. I ordered my bacon cooked easy, it came slightly burnt. During this whole experience, there were flys everywhere including on our food. It was so gross. I ordered a mimosa. Now I like a heavy pour, but even I had to order a side glass of OJ to balance the drink out. At the end of breakfast (most of which we didn't eat), we then ordered a growler. The waitress and bartender didn't know how to put it on the tab so had to ring us up two separate checks. Time to give them to card to pay for the checks and their system ain't working. The waitress said the only way to pay the bill was to write my cc # on my receipt and she would ring it later when they were back up. She says it happens often, my first thought is fix it or get a back up plan. Scary security risk?!  We left and went to a second place to have breakfast with no flys.",1.0

"Sorry. I wanted to like the place but couldn't. On the cab ride the cabbie (who is by the way a retired NYPD lieutenant working 4 days a week now making $80+G/yr) gave us a small warning but it was too late to change our reservations. 

There were 6 of us. The nice waitress gave us the rundown on the place; its background, its fresh and organic use of ingredients and its distilled and filtered water. Hmmm. We ordered the guac. It was delicious but the chips were delayed. After her recommendation we ordered the whole snapper Veracruz. Fried fish in a sauce with olives, tomatoes, peppers. It was ""ok"". I've eaten whole fried fish before and I was underwhelmed esp since she talked it up so much. My friend ordered rice, which was not on the menu and it was dry and horrible. Like it had been sitting there forever. He had to send it back. 

We inquired about the ceviche bar. The waitress said the hostess must've forgotten to give us the extra menu. We had already ordered because we had a show to catch. But afterwards she brought us the menu and there were a few things that we wanted from, including the ceviche and some special tacos. Annoying.

I was disappointed with my braised short rib tacos. Despite the sauce they seemed dry. There weren't very many people dining. Not a lively atmosphere. Decor was lab and dark. And the waitress was not very attentive. 

When we walked out to catch our show I saw the celebrity chef's pictures. Mary Sue milliken and Susan feniger. I loved them on top chef masters. Top chef is the only show I regularly watched. I can't believe they would put their names behind this type of poor quality. So disappointed.",1.0

"Not the worst but not the best. I wouldn't come back. The soup is very single noted, they forcefully add in the mint and toppings which just adds bitter mint flavour to the soup. 

On the plus note they are clean, the ambiance is quite hipstery, and they do have an interesting take on Banh Mi with their sliders. 

Seriously guys, stop featuring Pho as your main, you should consider the other lesser known vietnamese dishes such as, Banh mi, Fresh rolls, Banh Xeo, Banh Uot, Thiet Kho. 

And get your staff to suggest different and memorable food items. Customer service is very sedentary. You get more thank you's at McDonald's.",3.0
"A friend of mine called the Las Vegas Animal Emergency Hospital on Christmas.  His roommate's cat was dying and he didn't want it to suffer.

Someone named Jimmy answered the phone and asked several questions that seemed both unnecessary.and insensitive.

But one question sticks with me and is keeping me awake because I don't want to dream about the answer tonight.

""Do you want to watch?""

Apparently, you have to pay extra to watch a beloved pet be euthanized at the Las Vegas Animal Emergency Hospital.

So, I wonder, ""What do they do to animals  if you're not there?""

The possibilities haunt me.  The cruelty of the pay-to-watch fee structure and the coldness of the questions posed by Jimmy make me ill.

I remember calling after-hour and emergency vets in Los Angeles when my 15-year-old dog was dying.  The phone calls were some of the hardest conversations I had in my life.  But the vets I talked to  showed kindness and concern.  

No one advised me that I'd have to pay a premium to say goodbye.",1.0

"I don't update my reviews very often. Usually the business service is the same. In this case, I'm very dissatisfied with AAMCO. A few weeks ago, I asked them to check my car out. They did and gave me an estimate. Well, I was ready to have them make the repairs that they gave me an estimate on and called to make an appointment. I didn't have the estimate, but the guy who answered the phone said they didn't file the estimate. Why in the world would they not keep an estimate, so they would know what it is they checked out and what they would need to fix. It boggles my mind. Any other repair shop would have a copy of it and know how to schedule me in because they know specifically what repair it would be rather than relying on a customer to hold recite what's on the paperwork. When he told me he didn't keep their estimates, I decided they don't care enough to have my business. There are too many other repair shops and I will just go somewhere else. It's what I call poor business practices no matter how many good reviews they got. I just won't put up with it!",1.0

"It's a lovely park and the problem isn't with it itself; it's with the parkgoers. 

Simple as this: KEEP YOUR DOG ON A LEASH. 

I know, I know, your dog is different, it doesn't need a leash. It's not about your dog, it's about the safety of others and their dogs. Dogs on a leash get more aggressive toward dogs that aren't on one because they are more protective of their owner when they're on the leash. If you have your dogs just romping down a narrow trail without a leash they're going to run into another dog eventually.

You aren't special. You think the rules don't apply to you, but they do. Pittsburgh Police should have a plain clothes officer walking the trails handing out the $300 citations all the leash law signs in the park that people clearly cannot read.

The exercise areas in the fenced dog park area are more than enough space to play hours of fetch with your dogs, you shouldn't be doing it in the grassy areas next to the trail. 

Today alone I saw a husky, a rot, two german shepherds, and countless bigger mixes off leash outside the dog park on the trails. You're going to get someone hurt or another dog hurt; and it's going to be the dogs that suffer most because the city can't force you to be put down instead.

"Ordered the yellow curry (carrots, potatoes,onions, DARK chicken) One of the best currys I've had. I selected spicy and I started tearing up the first spoonful so I'm not sure I should review it considering I could hardly taste anything. Big quantities with tender chicken. Crab ragoons were typical but had more crab than I thought. Mango sticky rice is huge. They give you a whole mango and rice with maraschino cherries as a cute addition. Iced Thai coffee was delicious as well.

"I moved into a new home with a pool that was not in the best shape. I had no idea where to begin and needed quite a bit of help. I had 2 companies come out that refused to help, saying my pool would be too much work and it would never stay clean. Then I found Mike at Riley Pools. He spent time talking to me and getting to know me and my pool. He even came on a holiday weekend, which was not expected but very much appreciated. Riley Pools took on my pool and gave me reasonable and honest expectations. Since that first visit, both Mike and Tyler have been out to assist with repairs as well as weekly cleaning and chemical service. The prices are always very reasonable. The weekly cleaning, thanks to Tyler, has kept my pool looking spotless. So despite 2 other highly reviewed companies saying my pool would never stay clean, Riley Pools has kept it looking great. I can't recommend these guys enough!! If you need repairs or just a weekly cleaning and chemical service, consider giving them a call.",5.0

"This is just for the whole management of Cox Services in Las Vegas.

Cox is just like any oil company that pops in your head. Their monopolistic practices have made them the only acceptable cable/internet/phone provider in Clark County and they intend to do anything to bar out intruding services to compete with their digusting enlisted prices. I come from Los Angeles, where we get the same services that Cox provides for about half off. But the price is what makes the difference and Cox loves to suck the life out of you if they have to.

Because I spend a great deal of time online for multiple purposes, I need fast internet. To get that kind of service, I am forced to pay $50-55. JUST for internet. In Los Angeles,  you can get both cable AND internet for that price. Cox understands that they are the lone cable provider so they take advantage of this town.

Sad thing is, you really can't say no here unless you get Dish or Direct TV. If you do get those services, you must sign for a long term commitment which in truth, is technically cheaper in the long run.

Cox will never have lenience on your finances but it's not like you really have a choice. Even the customer representatives are hesitant when they say the prices over the phone because it makes even them throw up. I'm hoping that other services start making their way and once they do, Cox can go fuck themselves.",1.0

"I will never stay here again. I spent over $2,000.00 at this hotel. My husband and I stayed here while our house was being readied to move in to. During our visit we had to have housekeeping come and clean our room several times. They would start to clean the room and then must have been distracted because when we would come in the cleaners would have been left, the floors not vacuumed. The front desk person Peggy is the most rude person I have ever met. After having the hotel key not work in my room door several times I asked my husband to call the front desk and ask them to bring me a key. I was in the laundry room with the only working washer (the other one was broken) and not dressed to walk to the other side of the building when once again my key would not work. Peggy hung up on my husband when he asked to speak with management and then didn't answer the phone when he called. So I walked in my slippers, a tank top and sweats across the hotel once again. Peggy was at the front desk and I asked her why she hung up on my husband and she said ""because I was done talking"". I asked her to speak to the manager and she said I'm busy with a customer the manager isn't here. I admit I got annoyed at this point and asked her why my keys keep getting turned off. Told her she had the worst attitude and no customer service skills. She said I was rude and a few other things. Let's just say I will never stay here again. My advice is pick someplace else.",1.0

"OK, I love LOS and have eaten there well over a hundred times in the 12 years they have been open in Las Vegas. The quality of the food hardly ever varied and it was a SOLID FIVE STAR RESTAURANT. 

However, my last two visits held a few disappointments; I consider Nam Kao Tod to be one of the world's truly great dishes and almost always order it at LOS. The last two times I ordered Nam Kao Tod it was not the amazing, compelling, best thing I ever ate dish that it always was before, it was just OK. Another favorite, the Garlic Prawns were not prepared as carefully as usual and the portion size was HALF of what we were served before, other dishes also seemed to be served in smaller portions. I hope the problems were kitchen anomalies that won't become permanent. 

The smaller portions are more troubling, no one deserved a James Beard award more than Saipin but I hope it isn't the reason for the smaller portions and much higher prices..

"Service was good, but quality was sub par. I noticed soon after entering thay the restaurant was fairly empty (3-5 tanles being used) during peak dinner hours on a Thursday night. My roommate and I ventured here to check out their AYCE sushi, which was the least expensive around. During and after dinning, it was apparent why their price was slightly lower. The food quality did not match competitions in the area and their selection was also quite limited when compared to others. I can normally set large amounts of food at higher quality sushi restaurants, however, I only ate 2-3 rolls (which were merely rice, fish, and avocado, no better options) along with a few orders of nigiri. After that, my stomach became upset and quite bloated. I also noted immediately that the rice was VERY warm compared to other sushi bars. Whole the rice is normally cool or room temperature, the heat of the rice was very off-putting and altered the taste of the already lowER quality fish. I won't be returning here and will gladly pay $3-5 more for an AYCE option down the road for a better variety, higher quality, and improved overall experience.",2.0

But about 2/3 through the movie, my kids get too scared and want to leave - so we do. On the way out we hit the booth and I explain that through my own fault I overspent on the tickets, forgetting to note that two of our party were kids. All I wanted, if possible, was the difference between two adult tickets and two kids tickets, roughly 7 dollars total.  Instead, without being asked, they voluntarily refunded us the entire $34.50, noting that we hadn't stayed for the whole movie. Now that's classy customer service.

"Luchita's is definitely different than other Mexican places around. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad. To the lady complaining about the burrito, the menu perfectly explains what you are getting: ""a flour tortilla filled with your choice of shredded chicken, shredded beef, ground beef, refried bean, or vegetarian, then topped with melted cheese."" It's not their fault you were expecting something different. If you look up traditional burritos, that is how they are made - flour tortilla, stuffed with meat or beans. Just because everyone is used to chipotle's burritos being filled with whatever your heart desires, it does not mean that's what you're going to get at an actual Mexican restaurant. (If you do want a big burrito filled with lots of stuff, they have one, too.) Luchita's is definitely a little more ""Americanized"" than other nearby restaurants but I prefer it. I don't feel sick when I'm done eating there. If you really want authentic Mexican, order some of their specialty dinners. Luchita's is one of the few restaurants around with chiles rellenos and empanadas. Delicious.",5.0
"So yeah.  Zero stars for this place.  I went for spring break with my fiance.  I get that part of this has to do with the fact I am there in a high tourist season, however our hotel at a decent place was less that what it cost us to rent a Kia Soul.    We were not allowed to change our car even though we had no desire to be driving that.  We were basically harrassed about insurance for ten min.  They told us that we had to top off the fuel within a five mi radius and bring in a receipt with this information, as that failure to do this would incur a penalty.

To put another driver on the vehicle was more than twenty per day.  In some cities in a non tourist season you can get an economy car for that price.

The USB connection ports didnt work so charging iPods ect wasnt going to happen.

The major complaint happened at check in.  We were in a rush and I left some items in the vehicle.  I noticed that I left them when I was in the line for Southwest (that was a horror show as well), I called three times from the airport, once from the plane and once from our layover.  Then I called from St Louis where we landed.  Each time leaving messages.  I got a call a day later.  A majority of the items werent found.

The woman in the lost and found was nice, however couldnt explain what happend.  I spoke with her manager who told me that she would look in to it and call me the next day.  That was three months and five left messages by myself ago.  All she needed to do was say that they looked at the video tape.  Thats it.  I heard story after story from the Lost and Found woman about what they did, however it really never made sense.  Why some and not all of the items were recovered doesnt make sense until this day.

So while I understand that I didnt have to go to spring training and then it was my fault that I lost things, this was a rip off with a serious lack of courtesy to the end user.",1.0

"Go for the happy hour, enjoy the drink specials ($5 martinis among others. Yay!) and order the Big Ass Burger, but before you do remember these points:

It's open seating during happy hour (which runs 4-7). There were people sitting and standing around showing various states of impatience when we arrived. We walked around through the bar and front patio (the only areas open for happy hour) searching for an open table. Finally, a very nice manager caught up with me and offered a booth in the dining area with the caveat that we'd need to finish up or move to the bar by about 6:45, before a dinner reservation came in. We jumped at the offer, likely pissing off some others who had been waiting as well, and probably longer . No complaints in the way it was handled, but be aware that it's popular happy hour with open seating and when you arrive for a table you are basically on your own.

Second, it's an older crowd.  They look more like Scottsdale golf course residents than workers from the surrounding buildings. No problem there, either. Just a reminder that the line between ""happy hour"" and ""early bird special"" continues to fade.

Only one vegetarian burger on the menu: Earth Burger made of portabella mushrooms. I personally dislike mushroom burgers, so I passed. Also, why is a veggie burger more expensive than a beef burger?!

I had a variety of sides instead: Sweet Potato Fries, Beer Battered Onion Rings, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. Sweet potato comes with a side of powdered sugar, making it a great sweet/savory dish. The onion rings were incredibly light and airy, which is abnormal for something beer battered. Truffle fries were my favorite, highly recommend! One of these sides can serve 2-3 people.

Then they started whispering amongst themselves and looking angrily at us as if we did something other than order three hamburgers to go for $68.13 !
We have been Gordon Ramsey fans for a long time and this was our Very FIRST  experience at any of his restaurants.  What an incredibly disappointing experience !!  I guess the hamburgers were good  but honestly we lost our appetite.  We will not go back to GR BURGR.  (Manager see check # 8531327) Management needs to really choose who they put out in front to greet customers!!  They should be personable and friendly ...especially at a restaurant located at Planet Hollywood that caters to so many people from all over the country and world.

"Now that the hype is over the wait isnt so long.  Actually  at times there is no wait at all.  They have also started using ipads to showcase menu items that may have been explained above most guests culinary experience i.e, the banana  shake was not called a banana  shake originally  lol.

The food. Mmmmmm the farm burger.  Have you ever had duck bacon?  Forget slapping my momma I wanna slap G. Ramsey.  I can eat 2 of these burgers its that good.  Also sampled the blue burger, it was also delish.  The parm truffle fries a lil on the salty side for me but hey I was sober, shame on me for being sober in vegas lol.  

The now named banana  shake, best shake I've  ever had in my entire life, hands down.",4.0
"This place is phenomenal!

One of our favorite places to go for food in Vegas!

However... note to business owners/management:  The onsite manager stood there and did nothing (except talk to the servers).  It was super busy, and our onion rings were served cold.  When they were re-served, the outsides were crunchy and hot, but the breading in the insides was raw in the bigger rings.  (They looked good, but were not well-cooked).  This problem would have been easily avoided (I'm assuming for ALL customers that day/time) if the onsite manager had taken the time/trouble to actually walk around, or even perhaps sample the products from the different batches.  I laugh when I imagine what Gordon Ramsay's reaction would be if this was his T.V. show and he saw what was going on.",5.0
"I am one of those gals who loves to paint her nails but rarely gets manicures. I simply do not know the lay of the land in those places! Feeling fancy one day, I asked a friend where her beautiful nails were done and she recommended Dynasty. I have been there twice now and both times were enjoyable. I was able to walk in and be seated right away. The woman doing my nails this last time did a fabulous job. I brought a photo and my own polish for a party look I was going for, and she exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to show off my fun party nails, and will definitely return when I'm feeling fancy!",4.0
The only thing holding me from rating this restaurant 5 stars is pricing and portion. you shouldnt have to charge $25 a plate for 3 bites of food.. Cmon get the hell out of here with that. But with all that said the food here is pretty good but I think you can get a deal on their suckling pig dish if you have like 8 people..we saw another table ordering it and it looked awesome! Anyways the place is solid and if there was a happy hour on all their tapas dishes I would come back,4.0
"I don't understand why this place has so many good reviews. Small portions of mediocre food for an outrageous price. We've spent a lot of money on dinners in the past in Vegas and always left happy. This place broke the streak. The service is subpar. The waiters aren't helpful with their recommendations and don't even think about ordering something slightly different than what's on the menu--the waiter and chef looked like they were annoyed when we did so. Last but not least, the food just didn't taste that good. Go somewhere else while in Vegas--so many other better options.",2.0
"For someone that loves tapas, and loves modern / molecular gastronomy even more, Julian Serrano was total bliss.  From the moment we sat down, everyone was super accommodating and friendly. The waitress obliged our many questions about the dishes. Even when we asked probably dumb questions to the sommelier, he seemed just genuinely excited to talk about wine. Definitely not the usual smug a*hole you find at most expensive restaurants.

From the rather dark and cave like ambiance of the Aria Hotel's casino floor, Julian Serrano (JS) is a pop of very bright colors and trendy styles. There are decorative sound barriers between the casino floor and the restaurant, so you are sheltered from all the noise and smoke of the casino.

The tapas dishes were the second best tapas I'd ever had, second only to Jose Andres. The traditional Spanish dishes are tasty, but you can generally get them at most Spanish tapas restaurants. Branch out, and try the dishes from the ""Modern"" section of the menu. These are the hallmarks of Julian Serrano's creativity, not just a mastery of traditional Spanish dishes.

Best Dishes:
The molecular mozzarella with pork belly was fantastic. 
The rabbit and garlic mash dish was very garlicy and delicious.
Huevos Estrellados: This dish was a heart attack we had no chance of finishing, but it was delicious. French fries, fried eggs, and chorizo. Wrap your head around that one.

Not so great dishes:
While I love lobster, and I love pineapple, the lobster-pineapple skewer was too salty/rubbery, and not my favorite.
The gambas/shrimp dish was just cooked shrimp in a bowl of garlic-flavored butter. Really nothing to write home about.

Dishes run about 10-15 dollars each.  Total bill at the end of the night was under $200 for two of us after a bottle of wine (average price, not vintage, not the cheapest on the menu), enough tapas dishes to really fill us up, and a split dessert.",5.0

"HORRIBLE PLACE!!!! 

got the filet mignon and lobster tail! the lobster tail was HORRIBLE it tasted like rubber way over cooked and too much sauce which gave a horrible nauseous feeling!!

the filet mignon was already had better at cheesecake factory.

The roasted chicken was over cooked and disgusting.

they messed up on the french fries that we had ordered on the side.... it was burnt!!!!!!!!!

the service was horrible.... we saw a waitress maybe once or twice... throughout the night before we were given the check. She never once came by to check on us and the food!!!!!

our main server was the bus boy who got everything and was friendly enough to check on us... unlike the waitress.


we did make reservations and ended up being seated 30 min later as well..

5 star restaurant? I THINK NOT!


THINK AGAIN BEFORE COMING HERE.

for over cooked food...",1.0
"After watching Top Chef and having already been to Michael Voltaggio's stellar restaurant (The Dining Room), my wife and I had been looking forward to trying Tom Colicchio's ""Craftsteak"" for several months. So, the first thing we did when arriving at Vegas was make reservations.

I'll mention a few things: My wife and I are both under 30 and we were a party of two. I've always felt that if you really want to know how good a restaurant truly is, you visit as a party of two. Any restaurant in the world will bend over backwards to make a big party happy (servers know that more people = bigger tips), but when a restaurant treats a couple well, you know that they have class. 

Sad to say, this was the most classless fine dining experience that we've ever had. We would have complained to the manager had they been anywhere to be found... alas, Yelp.com gets the supreme pleasure of hearing the brutal truth :) Have fun with this guys/gals!

First: for $110 a person, you can eat like a king in Vegas. The food here was edible, but so is the food at any $30 buffet in town. You come to a place like this for top notch service and mind-blowing food - Craftsteak failed at both.

Service: 1/5

As many yelpers have suggested, the service here is almost non-existent until you are filling out the tip line on the check, when it becomes patronizing. We waited nearly 20 minutes before one of our four servers even bothered to ask us if we wanted to get drinks - and another 20 minutes before they asked if we wanted to order. With four servers you'd think that a party of two would be able to place a drink and food order within a half hour.

Now, before you think that this was intentional politeness on their part (nobody likes to be urged to order right away at a nice restaurant), this wasn't that - this was them being nearly oblivious to the fact that we were in the restaurant in the first place; Which is odd, because we made reservations and were seated front and center in the middle of the dining room. 

Still optimistic, we asked for an explanation about how the restaurant preferred to serve it's guests - but instead of being offered a clear explanation of the menu, the waiter rambled off a nearly incoherent sentence or two about how we should really just order from the chef's tasting menu. Ok, thanks for nothing - we are at Craftsteak, we KNOW that we're here for the chef's tasting menu! We came to spend!

20 more minutes passed before the next of our waiters arrived. He, again, advised us on the chef's tasting menu. We urged him to explain the tasting menu and finally we got an explanation - which would have been great except that he got his numbers completely mixed up. He explained that each guest receives 2 salad tastings, 2 meat tastings, and 2 side tastings. Our math said that meant 6 different tastings per person - 12 total - another Yelper mentioned 16 plates of food per couple, so that sounded about right. 

We waited another 15 before anyone came back to take our order...

The third waiter shows up like the friggin' hero of the day. We proceed to place our order, he informs us that we have everything wrong - you only get 1 of each tasting selection... which is kinda funny - because it defeats the purpose of the ""tasting"" menu if you are just going to serve massive family size portions of a few things, but whatever. We ordered the tasting menus (the wagyu beef versions, which were $130/person).

About 30 seconds pass before we did a little math and realized that we were actually paying quite a bit MORE for the tasting menu than if we had just ordered ala carte for the items that we wanted to try thanks to our fellow Yelpers (Bisque, Quail, Yukon Puree, Filet, etc.).

Throughout the meal, servers rarely came to the table to check on us. Service was tacky, although they were so pretentious that someone might confuse it for them being ""fancy"". Cmon yelpers - it's not ""fancy"" to leave cold, uneaten bread on the table for the ENTIRE meal when you have the main course out. It's not ""fancy"" to leave the clean, empty wine glasses on the table when we are on our second round of cocktails. Fine dining establishments are careful to manicure the eating process, this felt like I was at TGIF Fridays. Servers bumbled around, breaking 2 wine glasses and hoping no one saw. We had dirty, finished plates of food in front of us for the majority of the meal. My drink sat empty for no less than 25 minutes. 

I could go on but Yelp limits me to 5000 letters ;) 

Food - 2/5:
The Ribeye was tasty, but thin and covered in fat and gristle. The Filet was overcooked. The lobster bisque tasted like it was doused in fennel seeds. The quail, onions and yukons were good. The rest was mediocre at best. Again - it was edible, but for $110+ per person, my jaw should be in my lap. Worse, no ever checked on us despite $270 of food being on the table. 

Save your cash - or better - use it for a plane to LA and visit The Dining Room. We left disappointed.",1.0

"Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. Tried this place out. Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home. It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great. The problem is.. it wasn't very good. The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment.",2.0

Then asked me if I  liked rich guys. I was so annoyed and miserable, especially with my throbbing bleeding finger. Had to wait hours on my check up later on as well, just for them to tell me I was cleared to work again. The second doctor was nicer, and atleast thoughtful in pain sense, he told me that it was very close to seeing the bone, and was sure of the amount of pain I felt. Glad its over with now.",2.0
"Came in to visit client's for 3 nights. They offer shuttle service every half an hour to Mandalay Bay if your without a ride.

The lobby has several computers for printing of e tickets and they offer limited complimentary bfast although I passed on the bfast each day.

The staff at the front desk were friendly and they gave me complimentary water bottles which was nice. I'm not sure if I'll stay here again but this was a reasonable place to stay without walking through smoke filled casinos.",3.0
"I find there are very few establishments that do what I would really call 'good business' still left in the world.  I'm sure there are plenty I just run in to them every once in a rare while.  The Keg is one of them.

Two stories:

The first time I went here my friend and I just wanted a good steak so we searched out yelp and found The Keg was close.  Right off the bat I noticed the atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing over the top, but enjoyable.  I also noticed that the wait staff knew their shit.  Our waitress explained all the specials and recommended her favorites without hesitation.  The real highlight was before our food came when the manager came over and asked us if it was our first time.  He then brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house to kick off our meal.  

The second visit was for a friend's birthday.  We ordered a round of chocolate cake shots and the manager showed up to mix them himself and bought us our first round.  He also gave us each recipes to take home with us. 

The food on both occasions was great, I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, and I will definitely be going back.",5.0
I've been going to this restaurant for a number of years. I must say they have the best Prime Rib Burger I've tasted since I moved to Arizona. The service is always good. No matter what I order it's delightful. I recommend this for anybody looking for a great place to eat!,5.0
"I ordered the arizona burger last night and it was THE WORST hamburger I've ever had. It tasted like an over cooked, left over burger from a BBQ. The buns were also very dry, almost stale. I don't understand how anyone would serve the food they decided to put in front of me. The server never asked if we liked our food. She just picked it up (it barely had two bites from it) and asked if we wanted more beer. Very disappointed in the establishment. Not worth the drive and the hassle of parking a street away.",2.0

"Soooooooo. My friend and I came here because 1) it is walking distance 2) hello Mexican food and 3) it's always busy. I
I don't know if they were short staffed or
just the most unorganized bar? 
When we sat down (at the bar) we were greeted promptly and given a water. We ordered our beers and then waited. And waited and waited. The main reason we went is my friend was starving. We finally found someone and asked for food menus. We were given A menu. To apparently share. 
We then waited 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our orders. 
Once our order was placed the food did come out promptly. I had nachos and they were covered with fresh cut veggies and totally delish. He had the Mac & Cleese with pork which he also loved. 
Not once did anyone check on us. 
Not once did anyone ask if I wanted another beer - my glass was empty for 10 minutes. 
What if we were dead?!! No one would have noticed! 
The manager maybe owner appeared to have possible ingested PCP intentionally and was skipping behind the bar hollering.

"I don't go to bars anymore, so I'm not going to lower my stars just for that reason. I don't know what Fosters was like, what everyone kept talking about that this place was before a long time ago, but this bar had a nice ambiance. It has a church motif with a large cathedral like ""window"" that changed colors over the dance floor and cool ""medieval"" like ""flame"" lighting and faux lit candles. There were plush leather couches in a cozy side area which I liked, but it wasn't removed enough to make it easy to converse without having to raise your voice. Besides the noise level of what is basically a one-room bar, I didn't like the smoke machine as I kept thinking my contacts were dirty and it made talking even worse (I'm a little hoarse this morning). But then again, I don't do bars, so overall this place was well done in terms of design and would be a great place to go to in a group. The bartender was easy to get to and my drink was made very strong. Thumbs up.",4.0
"Okay. It's about time to write a review on this place. I've been coming here since it opened and have to admit that the quality has been slowly been going down for me. When they first opened, it was fantastic.

First off, the fries have been a disappointment as of late. The kimchi fries has been tasting less and less fresh. Just trying the fries themselves, they seem over cooked and tasteless. I stopped ordering them.

I stop getting the kalbi since the meat is not cooked properly and very chewy. I can tell that they are using a less quality meat now. I switched to squid and they were wonderfully cooked before but now they are over cooked and chewy. There is nothing wrong with the fresh veggie toppings but wished the protein were cooked properly.

They really need to clean the garbage area. The trash is obviously not working with the small shaped opening and it needs to have a flap or cover. There are all these small insects flying around and has become a nuisance during the warmer weather.

I used to rave about this place to friends but now it's not even someplace I would recommend. Try the burger joints across the street or even McDonald's by the corner.",2.0
"Definitely try the kimchi fries !!! It was the highlight of my night....just thinking of that savory meat fries kimchi and gravy was soooooo delicious....other than that, the banh mi was meh, it's basically a regular banh mi but with BBQ meat such as beef or pork for $6.....it's pretty pricy if u ask me, but next time when I'm back, gonna be trying the tacos and baos....it's a really small place with only about 6 tables so be prepared to take out or eat standing",4.0
"*4.75 stars*

It's back! It's back!  And it's delicious as ever still.  However, I found that it was better the first time.  Perhaps it's because you got to choose what you wanted in your taco prior to the renovations.

I came here last Friday with my friends.  I ordered myself the kalbi taco (since they ran out of pulled pork) and the kimchi fries.  The kimchi fries were DELICIOUS.  Very different -- if you're not into the ""sour spicy"" then don't try it.  They had pork in it as well, and it was delicious.  The kalbi taco was absolutely delicious, and had a good mixture of everything.

My plan is to try to have everything on the menu before the end of the year.  Gluttony at its best.

Why 4.75 and not 5?  The place is tiny.  Very very tiny.  Lack of seats, especially on a Friday evening.  My friends and I were crowded around the bar seats.  

Otherwise, delicious.  Need to try duck confit banh mi.",5.0
"Probably one of the poorer stays I've had at any hotel/motel...was going to say ""in recent memory"", but quite possibly ever.

To start with, the ""free wifi"" doesn't really work - at least not from the room I was staying in. The television in my room did not have reception, except for very fuzzy reception on a select few channels (who uses antennae anymore for television reception?), not to mention this motel is in a seedy area of town.

To top it off, there were urine stains on the bath-mat in my bathroom. No, I'm not kidding.

The one plus is a complimentary shuttle to the airport, and the rooms are cheap. Fortunately, I only had to endure one night as all I needed was a place to crash and any early morning shuttle to catch my flight home...

Would not recommend unless you're traveling on an extreme budget, or unless this is your last resort for where to stay....pay the extra money and stay somewhere nicer.",1.0

"Ok this place used to be called Mercadito (cute Spanish word for Market) placed inside Red Rock. I'll tell you I loved it! For one, they had a nice selection of fresh tacos, even had the taco of the month. Their civiche was amazing, and the guacamole was out of this country amazing. I also loved that on Tuesdays they had industry night and gave a 50% discount (eventually coming down to 30%) but still, a highly recommended, fun and delicious Mexican restaurant.

So what happened? It closed down and was renamed and revamped. Apparently a new company or owners took over and added this weird art. My problem is the menu. All of a sudden they have Fajitas? I like faijtas but why change a menu that was popular?

This place would get packed back in 2015, we had to wait 40minutes but we knew it be worth it. So we walked in, on a Tuesday and was surprised to see it was kinda slow. And even more surprised to discover the menu was petite and the flavor wasn't out of this country. 

I'm conflicted, it's not that it tasted bad, and it's not that it's overpriced and I miss my discount. It's just not impressive anymore. The guacamole is ok, my girlfriend had some Mahi tacos and they were served on flour tortillas and she wasn't going crazy for them like before.

I miss my jalapeño Mexican Mac+cheese, and now there's nothing exciting to order.

In the end, it's worth a shot for just having a margarita and some chips and guacamole if that's your thing. Just bear in mind the food isn't anything to rave about.",2.0

We wound up staying almost 5 hours enjoying ourselves and receiving excellent service. Next time we visit Libre, we will definitely ask for Joe to be our server again.

"Disclaimer: This is the most critical review I've ever written.  I am conscious of the negative aspect of internet culture that allows people to make unduly harsh comments at a high rate.  With that in mind, these are my honest feelings about my stay.  

As soon we arrived, we were hit with 80's hair metal cranked to 11 with no place to escape, except our room. On every inch of the hotel prepare to enjoy Dokken's greatest hits, and that deep cut from Warrant.  Our sleep this weekend was interrupted by the person who thought it was wise to decorate the hallways with actual drum cymbals.  I'm wondering if anyone during the design process considered the possibility that some guests might try to show off their drumming skills on the way back to their rooms after a night of drinking.  Needless to say, there were a lot of John Bonham wannabee's staying on the 9th floor.
 
Keeping with the theme of sleep deprivation, we were couldn't sleep due to the blinking smoke detector installed right above our bed.  When all the lights were shut off, and the black curtains were closed, the blinking smoke detector lit up the room like the lamest rave imaginable. This could go on for pages, so I'll continue with a shorthand checklist of problems:
- Guest Services was terrible.  I had to call 5 times to get an engineer to the room to fix the air conditioning.
- There were no responsible adults to be seen on staff.  All the employees are either in Motley Crue shirts, or working valet.  I really felt like if I complained about anything, they would shrug their shoulders and say ""sucks bro."" 
- There is no place to relax in the hotel unless you want to pay 25 dollars for the spa.  The pool is a giant party filled with cellulite and Bro culture. 
- The food tasted cheap,  like it was cooked by the gallon and over-sauced.

At least the bed was soft.

"Acai is the new froyo?

I joined the line for a free acai bowl mostly because I never queue for free anything and thought my bucket list should include doing so just once.

The atmosphere is sort of the mullet of snack shops: Jamba Juice-like in the front and medical-office-like in the back. For a while in the line, I was worried that I'd accidentally queued for free botox or pedicures or weird treatments that involved cucumbers and mild electric currents.

The acai bowl, when finally achieved, was really good. It's sweet-tart in a refreshing way -- it does actually taste roughly the red-purple shade that it is -- as it's basically a fruit smoothie soft-serve. The five-ounce bowl comes with slices of banana, berries, and a sprinkling of granola that's useful for absorbing the last melted bits of soft-serve. In the relentless sun of suburban Tempe, it has the magic taste of feeling about five years younger, deeply wise and earnest (if not actually in touch with the spirit of yoga masters), and in need of flowing garments with fringes.

When not a free offering, these are ungodly expensive. They're probably also little calorie bombs on the same scale as froyo.

If I were at this shopping center again, I'd have another on my own dime because Tempe is, for me, a vast beige suburban wasteland of dehydration that I need Calories of Refreshing Happiness to endure, and these calories are extremely refreshing and happy. If it were where I change buses on the way home from work, though, it wouldn't be a habitual stop.",3.0

"Very cute interior and exterior design, I like the concept of a mansion come restaurant. It was quite empty Sunday for brunch but hey that makes for a very attentive server so no complaints.

The good
-Awesome food! Seriously exceeded my expectations, the chef can cook alright!
- Huge portions...yummy!!
- Impressive brunch menu, more impressive than designated breakfast spots (ie. Cora's)and comes with a fruit salad.
-Great prices!

The bad
- Service could be better, waitress was less and less attentive and engaged in a conversation with friends at the bar.
- Could use some updating to make space more esthetically pleasing and spruce up a bit.

Overall I will definitely be back, amazing food and I'd love to try the lunch and dinner menu. This may become my go to brunch spot in markham!",5.0
"Anna is incredible. I am so happy I chose to have her as my dog walker. She sends daily reports and pictures which, to someone who works all day and misses their puppy like crazy, is a god send. She frequently takes my dog for longer walks than planned and sometimes takes her to the beach for an extra long walk at no extra charge. 
Anna is very sweet and loves my dog. She also spends time training her which is helpful while I'm working. 
She stayed over at my house one weekend while I was away and looked after my pooch which was actually very reasonably priced considering the extra attention my puppy got. 
On top of all of this, she runs her dog walking business very well. I appreciate the invoices she creates and how well organized she is. 
Overall she is the perfect choice for anyone looking for someone to love and care for their little furry ones while you are away.",5.0

"I was pretty disappointed by this place.

All the rave reviews, all the media coverage, it just didn't live up to the hype for me.

The portions are HUGE, but it is also on the pricey side.  The presentation is great, but those alone didn't do it for me and actually worked against it. 

The huge portions are overwhelming and you really don't want to eat more.  I had the fried chicken benedict.  It was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The chicken was good, but the rest (aside from the bacon), really didn't work well for me.  I didn't like the chipotle cream sauce they used either, country gravy would have been awesome.

In sum, it's good to try, but I really wouldn't go back.",3.0

"I'm not a huge fan of dry-rub chicken wings, but their Louisiana rub is to die for. It has the perfect amount of heat and flavor!
Other than that, all their wings are made fresh and come out hot right away.

The only thing is, I wish their Garlic Parmesan was better. They really don't do justice to my favorite flavor. Their Garlic Parmesan is just regular wings with a slight taste of garlic and covered in shredded Parmesan that you could probably buy at the Wal-mart next door.

Wingstop, Imma let you finish, but B-dubs got the best garlic parmesan sauce ever.

Other than that though, this place is great for lunch and I love coming here when I'm on the way home. Definitely recommend Louisiana rub over any other flavor.",4.0
"Where do I start? Well... My friends and I waited for 20 minutes before we had to go back to the hostess stand to ask if we actually had a server to which she responded ""yeah (insert servers name here) is your server, did you want me to get her for you."" 
""That would be great"" 
Eventually we ordered our drinks, a few friends ordered food. Our empty glasses and dirty plates sat on our table all night. We decided to endure the 7 minute wait at the (very quiet) bar to get refills on our drinks because it was better than waiting on our server. My friend and I actually left our table, went to joeys next door, ordered a drink and sat at their beautiful bar- while our friends waited for the server to return to our table. The tables that surrounded us in the bar area were filthy with empty glasses and dirty plates an hour after the guests left the establishment. 
I strongly believe the finger of blame should not be pointed at the server (which is why I didn't mention her name, or the manager (who looked overwhelmed and didn't appear to be very helpful with the pile of glassware at the bar, or surrounding filthy tables) 
I believe this is a head office issue. I would suggest hiring a training team to assist with your employees and helping them understand the steps of service. I am not one to publicly review a restaurant online- but I was left with no choice as their is no email address on their website or even a place to make a complaint.",1.0

I go to Vegas a few times a year. I've stayed at Mandalay bay and had good experiences so I was excited to try the Delano. We booked the two queen suite and were excited because we don't usually do suites. We arrived at the Delano around 11 pm already frustrated from awful traffic from Orange County only to be told that they over booked and we didn't have a room. It totally ruined our night. They ended up putting us in a regular room at the Mandalay bay which was nice but we booked and paid for a suite. It was a huge disappointment. I won't book here again.,1.0

"Ssssspicy, haha. But I like it. 

I was introduced to this restaurant by an old friend and I have been loving it ever since. They share the same parking lot with Oyshi and a few other recognizable places so parking can be a little eh. Be vicious! jk.

They have a very chill ambiance here (hope you like k-pop) and it's exactly the type of place you feel comfortable just chatting it up with friends over a delicious meal. I also love the white lights, korean manga in the booths, and ""play area"" here. You will be thankful for the tea that they serve in tin bowls instead of water if you want to eat spicy. However, just ask and they can bring you out some water.

So far, I have tried:

Kimchi Fried Rice: STOP READING AND JUST ORDER IT (jk, but it's really that good)

Fried Dumplings: Just crispy enough for some crunch on the outside, but be cautious about the inside because contents might still be hot. Definitely use the sauce that accompanies it. Yum.

Dduk Bok E with Ramen Noodles: OH GOSH IT'S SO GOOD! And so darn spicy! Haha, but I just can't get enough of it. It's a korean casserole with ramen noodles and seafood as well as some veggies. This one is definitely for sharing. 

Dolsot Bibimbap: This is something that I order to help give my mouth a break from all of the spicy foods and it is definitely delicious. White rice to be mixed with cucumbers, bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and seaweed in a warm pot. 

Soon Dubu Jjigae: This is a Spicy Tofu Soup and it was alright. Not the best I have had, but not the worst either.

Ramen: About $9 for a bowl of delicious ramen. My brother ordered this once and I wanted to steal it from him!

The only mildly ""bad"" experience I have had here was when one of the waiters had forgotten to put in our orders twice, but he was so apologetic that we couldn't even hold it against him :) the servers here are very sweet.

I'm definitely a fan and love bringing my friends here with me! Do yourself a favor and try them out.",5.0
"My friend got us comped tickets and a comped sweet here while we were attending the Billboard music awards upon our arrival it was hard to get checked in at the front gate because it's a private hotel and there are three different buildings but we found it and to my surprise an hour after checking there was a door knock on my door
And there was a bellman with a complementary fruit cheese and chocolate basket
We were also given a bottle of wine

"Oak Ridges Community Centre is a community centre with many different things going on. The have an Eco Centre that has many artifact items and information on the nature or the area. There are activity and program rooms for multi purposes but from what I have seen, it's mainly used for educational purposes. They have a large swimming pool area with two pools. One for children and the other for adults or the more advanced. The Oak Ridges Community Centre also has an aerobics centre, fitness centre and a gymnasium. It's a really nice community centre. One of the best that I have seen yet. 

I went there for a Volleyball tournament and probably pick up sports a couple of times. The floors are well maintained and they have relatively high ceilings which is great for certain sports. I would definitely recommend this facility as it is one of the most beautiful community centre that I have seen with a wide range of facilities to utilize. Only problem is there is not really a change room for the gymnasium. Overall a great community centre. Check it out yourself and you will agree. JimStar Out!!",4.0

This is now my go to place for authentic quesadillas and tacos when visiting AZ. To compliment the great food and service, the price of it is great.

I love sprouts! One of my favorite places to shop. Good prices on good products. I've found I can trust the brands they carry. This location is closest to my house and the employees are all very polite and helpful. They seem pretty knowledgable on products as well. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the neighborhood. The CVS next door is ghetto and bringing the whole plaza down. Something needs to be done about the trash flying around the lot and the homeless asking for handouts on my way in or out of the store.

"Simply put, this is an exceptional restaurant. I was fortunate to dine here twice during a trade show in Las Vegas. The first night was with a large group of people and the menu was Prix Fixe. Most the time you'll think that they're doing this just to get people fed and out-a-here. Not the case at all. Each course was a delight culminating with my main course - the salmon.

The next night was with 1/3 the amount of people and the menu was standard fare. Wider choice. In each case, you'll start with a fantastic mix of naan with tasty sauces. Then the crispy shrimp - awesome! The handmade meatballs are fantastic (and I wasn't a big meatball fan but at this place I am). The crab-lobster maki rolls? Delicious.

The first night I had the pacific salmon with miso glaze, mizuna, soy butter, shiitake mushroom. Simple and delightful. The second night, Jesse the waiter recommended the ribeye. Never had one so good and I've eaten at steak places in both Chicago and New York.

Lastly, the service. Top notch, world class. I was taken care of by Jesse the waiter both nights. He and his support staff handled their duties with perfection rounding out the entire positive experience.

Oh and the ambiance and atmosphere? Hip but not over the top. The kitchen is behind glass and you can watch what's going on but really it sets an atmosphere of energy and movement. The only, if ever so slightly small nitpick is that it's loud. But really, it's the energy that makes it loud as people are simply enjoying themselves. I certainly did.",5.0

"We were visiting Vegas and a friend's aunt (who lives in Vegas) recommended this sushi place. I ordered a deep fried CA roll and the fried rice. My friend ordered a deep fried CA roll with cream cheese and the fried rice and my other friend ordered a regular CA roll with miso soup.

It was okay, but I've definitely have had better. I don't like when places use fake crab because they usually use way too much. That's what happened this time. The fried rice was good because they did it off of the teppenyaki tables, which is my favorite.

"My co-workers compromised with me and decided to take me here on my birthday recently. One of them hates Thai food and doesn't like to get nuts with anything ""exotic"". This time they made an exception. 

I've been to Pinkow (which is very close) many times and was always very satisfied with everything. However, many people people told me to ""try Archi's, try Archi's"" so I did since it was close to where we worked. It gets insanely busy at lunchtime, so I'd go at around 11:30am for lunch or an off time for dinner. When I walked into Archi's it was a little too nice and lacked the great questionable dump factor that I really enjoy of the great Thai places I've been to in Las Vegas (Pinkow now being an exception with it's newer locations). As always, I searched the menu for ""Spicy Mint Chicken"", but only found ""Spicy Basil Chicken"". This raised an eyebrow for me since every Thai restaurant I've ever been to has had the mint version of this dish. Anyway, I ordered it. They probably could have made the mint version, but I wanted to see their take on it.

I got the lunch special which comes with soup, a wonton and an egg roll. I have to say they really do give you a lot of food for the price. I always ask for a ""10"" in spiciness and they did a pretty good job of obliging. It's never really a 10 though. 

Overall, the food was pretty good, but they put big chunks of cucumber in the chicken which I've never seen before and that was kind of a turn off. I had to segregate the cucumber from the chicken like a little kid since there was a strangely abundant amount of it. 

My co-worker, who doesn't really vary from Americana, got the sweet and sour chicken. It looked and, by his report, tasted like dog food. I guess that what you get when order Chinese food from a Thai place. All in all, Archi's is good. It's just not my preference. It just could have been a little dirtier.",3.0

"My go to place for jerk chicken. This place by far has the largest portion size to dollar ratio - $8 (including tax) will get you close to half a chicken's worth of delicious, fall-off-the-bone jerk chicken on a bed of rice and steamed vegetables. Whenever I open up the styrofoam box, my friends all ask me where I got my meal from, because it's just that good! They even have a $5 lunch special that might just do the trick for you (but not for me, cuz I eat too much )

There's a reason why there's almost always a line up outside, but it moves fairly quickly, making it a great alternative to Seven Lives just down the street if you don't want to wait forever. They're also open rain or shine, hail or sleet, blizzard or hurricane - you can often see them standing next to the grill outdoors in the dead of winter.

Anyways, the buses are clean and there's ample space. Wifi is shotty so bring something to keep you busy. My seat had no USB charging port if that matters to anyone. If you are leaving or arriving during rush hour, expect to be late. If these things matter for you, I would suggest you find an alternative but there won't be anything as cheap as Megabus to Montreal.

"We ordered dinner to be delivered to our house. The delivery was fast. We had a mix up with the combo due to an error on our part. The owner called us personally to explain why we didn't get fries with our gyro. He was very nice, personable and understanding. This is a man who cares about his business. 

I only gave it 3 stars because the food itself was just ok. I ordered a shawarma salad and added chicken. It came in a clear container with a ""Best Buy"" date sticker and a label stating what kind of salad and a price tag so I know this was not made to order. I work in a hospital so it reminded me of the cafeteria there. Baba gnoush was packaged the same as well although that was absolutely delicious. The chicken on the salad was so hard. It was like the outer part of a store bought rotisserie kind that had been shredded off and left to sit for days in the frig. I took it all off and gave it to the dog. He was happy. The dressing and salad itself was good though. 

I think if he presented his food in a more fresh way his business could thrive. Cafeteria style is not attractive. Especially since we paid $33 for a gyro, tea, salad and baba gnoush that was low quality. He is a good guy though. Maybe he will read this and take some pointers from an outside perspective.",3.0

I told the guy ""3"" times not to put tire shine on my tires, because I live on a dirt road and it turns them orange. So he wrote this on the window. He said he would do a full interior clean ( besides the carpet cleaning) and hand wash for $69.99. I was thinking ok, that sounds alright for everything. I told the salesman I had an appointment at 3:00 pm, so that gave them about an hour and 45 minutes. ""No Problem!"" he says. So finally 5 till 3:00pm they came to give me the keys. Well I didn't pay yet ( wanted to make sure everything was ok ). I could see the water spots from 15 feet away, they put tire shine on 2 of my tires ( which now are turning a lovely color of orange ), and the dash of my Tahoe looked like they ran a dirty wet rag across it. I told the guy I wasn't going to pay nearly $70.00 for this. He was all, "" give me 5 minutes"". So I said ok. Then 5 minutes was up and they weren't anywhere close to having it done. After about 4 more ""give me 5 minutes"" I just told them I had to go, and it's not right for them to charge me full price. So they gave me a voucher for a ""V.I.P. Car Wash""  for next time I was in town. So I told the guy named Roy that I would be back in 3 weeks. He said he would make it his personal responsibility to hand wash, wax and do the interior. I returned 3 weeks later. The same sales guy was trying to tell me that there was no way a guy named Roy told me this, because the only guy named Roy that worked there was in oil and lube only, and the guy that signed the voucher transferred out. So after them trying to sell me another wash, and telling me the chip that was in my windshield was gonna spread ( even after telling them that I've had it repaired and it's been fine for 2 years) and trying to sell me a windshield. Well I guess more trying to rip off my insurance by replacing it when it wasn't needed, we finally got a manager to approve just a hand wash and vacuum. So when they get done, I went to look at it and even though it was better than the last time, my rims weren't even wiped down and they didn't vacuum. I was just disgusted, and wanted to leave. I went in to give the women my voucher and leave, she came up with a total of $15.00 extra I was suppose to pay. After waiting for the manager again they finally okay'd it. I went to get my keys, and guess who I see ""Roy"". I asked the guy that handed me my keys, what was the name of the man drying that car. He said ""Roy""! I was seeing red at that point. So I just got in my car and drove away.",1.0
"Stopped here this past weekend while I'm Las Vegas for a family outing and absolutely loved it. We split the steak, chicken, and shrimp at the teppin table and fell in love with the food and service.

"Visited here on a Sunday evening with the family. It is located in a small plaza in Aurora. Papous Tap & Grill is a fun, casual dining experience. There is a cool bar area where its seems many locals come to watch sporting events. Mixed crowd of young and old, good for kids. The dining area is large, clean, with plenty of cool decor. Good for groups and service is pretty fast, at least the time we were there.

Menu is big, has a little something for everyone. Nachos, wings, gyros, pizza, subs & wraps and awesome burgers. My wife and I both had burgers and they were tasty. My son had corn dogs and fries and finished the plate. Next time in, we will build our own pizza. They also have healthier choices like soup, seafood, veggies for a sides or large salads. Full bar with draft beer, especially local brews. Mixed drinks and drink specials! 
The service is good. Girl waiting on us came back to the table to check on us a number of times. Type of place were you can have good food and have fun without being afraid to be a bit loud with your group. The 3 of us will be back because we all enjoyed it. Way better then any chain restaurant in the area. Give it a try!!!",4.0

"I wanted to write a review to let everyone know that Dr. Dave Smith is an amazing dentist. Before I went to him, I was always covering my smile, embarrassed how my teeth looked.  I was in my late thirties when I had my braces put on.  Dr. Smith saw my insecurities about having braces at my age and assured me that more and more adults are having braces.  It was a ""journey"" for me, but the outcome was GREAT!!! I love how my teeth looks and my smile.  I gained back the confidence that I once lost. I have recommended him to all my family and friends.

"May be my new favorite spot in Charlotte.  I love supporting a local place over a chain--King's Kitchen is a non-profit, with 100% of profits going to feed Charlotte's homeless AND they employ homeless and give them job skills to be successful in the restaurant industry.  I ordered lunch and had a glass of wine while I waited.  (Washed my hands before eating and the restroom was spotless.)  The Event Coordinator, Joseph, let my friend and I both try the glass of wine we ordered before we bought it, and made wine suggestions based on what we liked, (ie: I said I liked Pinot Grigio, not too sweet, and he suggested the Pinot Gris.  My friend loved Chardonnay--Joseph said he had a Napa Chard and a French Chard, and the French was his favorite.)  Nowhere else does that.  The sandwich I got-sourdough Panini with chicken, was fantastic.  The sourdough had the right amount of butter, and had grill marks like it had been done on a real grill, as opposed to something electric.  The chicken breast was a good size, and the pimento cheese on the sandwich was so good.  The flavor and texture of the beans was fantastic--flavored with pork and not mushy like some.   Atmosphere was fantastic so I was definitely not wanting to go back to work.  Can't wait to bring people here.  I've passed this place so many times and I'm only mad I didn't try it sooner!",5.0

"We were in town for Turkey weekend, which means we needed a restaurant that could hold a crowd.  We came here for dinner on Saturday night with a total of 11 of us, including 2 very well behaved children (not even being sarcastic - it's just true).  We had a great time, and the restaurant itself was lovely!  It's very bright and even though it's loud, it's not deafening.  Everything everyone had was really good.  My hubby and I shared a wedge salad, but there were also a couple of Caesar salads and chopped salads at the table along with the soup of the day.  Our salad was super crisp and really good!  The Caesar salad was also delicious from the bite I tried!  For mains, I had the linguine carbonara and my hubs had the prosciutto pizza, and we split the two.  Both were really good!  The carbonara was a little creamier than I usually like, but it was seriously still so good!  For dessert I shared the brownie with my nephew.  FYI for anyone on a diet, you should always share dessert with a 6 year growing boy!  I seriously only got a couple bites in before he had ate it all, but it was also really good from what I tasted!  
I would definitely come back here again next time I'm in town.",5.0

"I may be in the minority here, but I really like this airport. I've never had a bad experience here, ever. I've flown into so many airports in the U.S., and this one sticks out in my mind as one of the better ones in terms of service. 

I come here fairly regularly because it's the closest airport to my dad's house. It's pretty far from glamorous. Hey, it's Cleveland, well, just barely in Cleveland, but I guess it still counts. They try to make it cool with sculptures and art. I don't really care what airports look like to be honest. 

The TSA here rocks. You read that right. I seriously appreciate them. I go through the pre-screening with my son every time, and they make it as easy and painless as possible. They have been well trained. I was told I could call ahead and tell them I was traveling with someone who needed special assistance and they would take care of me, no waiting in line! This is a fantastic service in my opinion. It's not available at every airport though, so you need to check ahead when traveling. Some cities are pretty rude too, which is why I just love this airport, the employees here are always so nice. You can tell that they've been trained well, it shows. The management here that I've dealt with far exceeds the one in my hometown airport, hence the 5 stars.",5.0
"6:30 - Wow, what a cozy little place, I'm so excited to eat here, everything on the menu sounds absolutely delicious.  Chef Decorte came around and welcomed us, giving off a wonderfully warm aura. This place is definitely super friendly, me likes.

6:50 - Oh emm gee, the amuse was appetite whetting and an annoying tease. I'm absolutely starved and craving more.

7:00 - Pre-apps arrive and I'm ecstatic. Delicious croquettes, rich foie gras torchon, silky smooth chacuterie, deeply flavouful terrines, accompanied with some of the most amazing bread I've ever eaten. Getting my wine glassed re-filled and I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.

7:27 - Sharing four dishes as our real apps, fish soup, steak tartare with fingerling potatoes, deliciously creamy and garlicy escargot, more croquettes. Second bottle of wine ordered and opened.

7:45 - Happily waiting for mains, good conversation, good people, all smiles.

8:00 - Still waiting...  Haven't seen our waitress in a while, getting a bit drunk at this point. 

8:21 - Our food finally arrives and... hey! it's extremely disappointing.  The duck marget was imo inedible as it had an extremely bitter flavor akin to cough medicine, the cassoulet was flavorless - beans completely undercooked and difficult to eat served with chewy, unappealing duck.  The duo of beef was decent, but really under seasoned but at this point I had lost my appetite and enthusiasm to continue.

8:37 - We're informed that we need to leave as the second seating is about to begin.  No time of coffee or dessert, get out, you took too long waiting for your food.

9:00 - We take refuge at Splendido for our desserts and aperitifs (and more chacuterie)

What started off as a fantastic dining experience quickly soured and turned into a punchline for the rest of the night.  What a shame because Ici Bistro went from being completely awesome to total disappointment within a 30 minute time span.  Maybe we were just unlucky.. oh well.",2.0

"I finally decided to write a review on Sedona. 

The biggest reason why I gave this place two stars is because everything I loved on the menu is now GONE. what.

The main reason I used to love this place was for their Surf & Turf for $24.99. It was all day any day. The Surf & Turf consisted of a New York Strip Steak and a Lobster Tail. It was a great deal and as of a few months ago they took that off the menu. (I discovered this the last time I was there, sometime in the late summer.) So I ended up ordering just a steak and decided to try the Foie Gras Fries ($17.99) and loved it. 

So, this past weekend I went for a going away party and was excited to get the Foie Gras Fries again as something to snack on. BUT they no longer have it. **SUPER SAD FACE**

I decided to try the Proscuitto Salad and have some calamari instead. 

In short, food is still ok but most of my favorites on the menu are gone. And, I do want to mention that it takes forever for food to come out.",2.0
"To Sedona's Credit,  the GM contacted me via e-mail to rectify the situation.  I promptly responded, but have not heard from her since.  I assured her I would try this establishment another time and update the review based on that visit.

I sincerely hope the email was not just to get a ratings boost.  Time will tell...




This really pains me, but I can't give Sedona more than 1 star!  I see a lot of other decent reviews, but that simply wasn't my experience here.  

After driving by no less than 100 times, I finally decided to take advantage of the $19.99 Steak and Lobster special.  This is my weakness and I had previously never met a Lobster I didn't like!  

Upon entering, I was struck by a feeling of attempted class.  I say attempted because the walls are really quite bare, but the decor that they do have is not cheap.  The lighting is reduced and the furnishings are on the more upscale side, but something just doesn't feel right.  I walk up to the bar, primarily because it is wide open, take a seat and prepare to ask for a menu and begin the ""what Vodka do you have"" game.  I am immediately greeted by a bartender in a classy (from the front) black dress and told ""If you aren't gambling, you can't sit there"".  Now, call me crazy, but I am more accustomed to ""Hi, how are you today?"" or... God forbid from a place ATTEMPTING class ""Good evening, Sir.  What can I get you?"".  My expectations were obviously high... after all, this IS the place with the discount steak and lobster.  Being no stranger to a video poker machine, the only civil response I could muster was a curt smile as I inserted money into the machine and ordered my drink.  As the bartender turns away, I notice that the once ""classy"" dress is has an open back and she has a freaking mural tattooed on her back.  Nothing against tattoo's, but this is a FAIL!

After about 20 minutes and setting off half a dozen flares to get the bartenders attention, I ordered my food.  In the interests of time and YOUR boredom, I will skip to the point and say that most of the 25-30 minutes that I was waiting for my food, most all of the staff (I think even the cook - he certainly wasn't a 'chef') were gathered around the service area discussing their weekends.  Another FAIL on the class front.

Food is here-  A firm believer that there is no other way to eat a steak than medium-rare, my cow is cooked to baseball mitt levels.  The seasoning was non-existent and the presentation was sloppy (sorry, didn't think to take pictures at the time as I was busy downing TUMS). The lobster was rubbery, obviously over-cooked.  By far the most edible item on my plate were the veggies, as I had to send the potatoe back for another microwave session.

I will not be back here, which is really disappointing because I keep getting text messages and email offers from the apparently mandatory players club card I signed up for (skipped that part, but it was entertaining).   Sorry Sedona!",2.0
"You know how whenever people eat food on TV, they seem to overreact about how delicious the food is? They moan and groan and smile and close their eyes while savoring the food. I always thought it was just for TV, but Lago managed to evoke those emotions out of me. Wow.

I went with three friends during CES weekend right when it opened for the day. While they set up our table, we waited near the front of the restaurant in this lounge-ish area; that was pretty cool and hip. The restaurant decor was very clean and modern. Each table has a simple metal vase of fresh flowers; I thought it was a nice touch. Tables have a marble finish, so they're great for the instagram background LOL! They definitely put a lot of attention to detail in the presentation of the place; when we refreshed our plates, the server made sure all the logos on the plates faced you instead of randomly placing the plate onto our table. And since I went for lunch, there was plenty of light streaming through the windows facing the fountains. 

For drinks, we got the ""mojito passione"" and ""rose and rye"". Presentation was SO ON POINT. The mint leaves of the mojito were even gold dusted! My friend and I did think that the drinks were pretty strong, The server did mention ""rose and rye"" was his favorite.

For food, we decided to go with the tasting menu. The food is tapas style, and they had a lot of options, so I'm glad we had the chef do all the menu picking for us. They ask if there are any allergies to be aware of. And then you just sit back and wait for the best food journey of your life. 

They bring out two dishes at a time. NOTABLES WERE: the bistecca (as part of the surf and turf), lobster gnocchi, and the burrata dish. That sauce for the steak was SO BOMB. After my first bite of meat, I had the biggest grin on my face. And even as I'm writing this review, the memory of it is bringing a smile to my face. The lobster gnocchi sauce tasted very similar to lobster bisque, and we all loved it! The biggest letdown was the pasta dish with truffle; it was just okay. The other dishes were a blur, so good thing I took pictures of them! haha

Our subtotal came out to be 406 for 4 people. We ordered two drinks and a dessert in addition to the tasting menu. Our server was great, and they even refreshed our plates halfway through the meal.

TL;DR This is undoubtedly a pricey place.  But for the food, the ambiance, the view, the service--and let's be real, we're on the strip in Bellagio, it's worth it.",5.0

"Went to SW Steakhouse last night. Sat right next to water. Lovely scenery, but I personally thought the ""show""on the lake was a little underwhelming. I would rather have just listened to some nice soft/classical music, myself. The service was good...especially from the host who took GREAT care of us despite our late arrival time. The food was just OK for me. Husband had chili-rubbed ribeye & I had the butter poached lobsters. For sides: potatoes au gratin, creamed corn & sautéed mushrooms.  We also shared the crab cake appetizer. Everything was just ""pretty good"". Nothing ""WOW""'d me...and I REALLY wanted it to. I think, honestly, it's because we went to Wolfgang Puck's CUT Las Vegas a while back. It's a little more expensive but so wonderful...especially if you're celebrating a special occasion.  Spend a little more & go to CUT.... You'll thank me later!  ...And NO, Wolfgang Puck didn't pay me for this review, lol. I'm just being completely honest!!",3.0
"i ate here on 10-25-14 around 6 pm.  i made reservations for 1 only a couple hours before.

holy ambiance batman!  the interior of the restaurant was pretty dang nice!  not sure how one is able to sit outside.  i didn't bother and took a table inside the restaurant facing the water/light show.

the bread basket was freaking amazing!  best free bread i've ever had!  my caesar salad was good.  my taste buds do say the salad was a little over priced.  for dinner i ordered a 20 ounce bone-in ribeye and a side of mac & cheese.  The ribeye was great.  It was no different than any other $60 prime ribeye.  the steak was not caked in butter and seasoning.  it was quite tender and had good marbling and very juicy.  the mac & cheese was a huge portion and very good.  for dessert i have no idea what i ordered but it tasted good.

"Ah, Custard's.  This was a staple in my childhood.  I remember going here for lunch on the last day of school every year with my friends.  In the summer, we'd stop for ice cream after a long day of swimming at Avonworth pool.  I had forgotten about Custard's until I had to drive past every day on my way to work.  It's still delicious, and the prices are amazing!  It's so inexpensive.

I don't think there is any bad ice cream here.  Some personal favorites include the hot fudge sundae and the ice cream of the week flavors.  The orange cream was one of my favorites for forever, and they used to do an amazing coffee ice cream too.  A small is less than $2.  What more could you want in life?

The actual food is really good as well.  I LOVE their footlong hot dogs with saurekraut or chili!  The also have amazing Italian subs!  I'm actually not sure if I like the food or the ice cream better.  It's standard American fare, but it's good stuff.  Again, the prices are amazing!

The parking lot can get a little packed, but this is an old school ice cream stand.  It's only open in the summers so we still have a while to wait to enjoy it's deliciousness!",4.0

"For some reason I thought that I've already wrote a review for this place because I've been going here for years! I literally stumbled into this place by accident. We were actually looking for an Italian restaurant, and close by was more of a pizza place, not so much pasta. 

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is definitely a hidden gem. It is next to the Euphoria Wellness dispensary. It is a small family owned restaurant. They have bar style seating along with normal restaurant seating. They have a specials board and a normal menu. Their menu ranges from $5-$18. 

They literally have the best katsu in Las Vegas that I've tried so far. Depending on how I am feeling I either get the Chicken katsu or one of the tonkatsu. It's a hefty serving! It comes with rice and salad. The salad is just shredded cabbage but whatever the dressing is made out of is the best! It pairs well with the katsu! You also get a side of miso soup and a little pickled shallots. Everything is so good. You also get to make your sauce with the tonkatsu sauce and crushed sesame seeds. 

The tonkatsu donburi is my second favorite. When I order food to go or for pick up, I always get the donburi mostly because if I ordered the normal katsu, it might get soggy. The Donburi is really good! It also comes with the miso soup. Make sure you try it out! 

The melon soda float makes for a drink/dessert. Just saying!

Oh and the service is great!!!",5.0
"My friends and I were looking or a place to chill and have a few drinks and we came across Ri Ra Irish Pub in Mandalay Place and figured to give it a shot. None of us have been to an Irish pub so I we were excited to find out what they have to offer.

The hostess asked if we preferred to sit close to the live band but she not-so-subtly implied that we may want to sit in a booth further away because it gets pretty loud. We took her advice and sat in a booth in a room where we could still hear the music but still hear each other.

Cha-ching! First thing we noticed was that they have happy hour all day everyday for the entire month of March. A pint of Black and Tan or Half and Half is only $4. The boys took advantage of the happy hour and the girls ordered cocktails which were at a regular Strip bar price of $13.

We ordered the chicken wings which were pretty decent and the fish and chips. We were surprised by how good the fish and chips tasted.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the batter was light and not greasy at all. The chips were well seasoned. The regular size was $13.95 and the large is $18.95. We just got the regular and it was filling for two people. 

To end our meal, we asked the waitress for Irish coffee and she asked, ""Do you want real Irish coffee?"" to which we agreed even though we didn't know the difference. Little did we know that real Irish coffee comes with a good amount of whiskey! It was good for the first few sips but got a little too strong for our amateur taste buds. One Irish coffee costs $8.

All in all, our first Irish pub experience was memorable. Service was really good; they checked on us regularly and kept our table clear of extra glasses and plates. I would definitely go again just for the fish and chips and to take advantage of their March happy hour special.",4.0
"Neat place, supposedly the structure was shipped from Ireland. We came in for an appetizer but ended up staying for dinner.

Had the scotch egg for an appetizer and it was unlike any scotch egg we had ever had. They split it open and filled it with deliver egg creaminess. It tasted like deep fried Easter morning. 

We also split the dubliner which is a lamb burger with rosemary, carmelized onions and some kind of creamy deliciousness. 

The Brussels sprout and bacon were fine but needed something. We added a bunch of salt because they were prepared with none. 

The warm bread for the table looked delicious, however, we were not given any.

"I had the reuben sandwich.  It was terrible.  Incredibly dry.  I could not chew it enough times.  After gnawing my way through half the sandwich, I gave up.

I had the sweet potato tots as a side.  They were soggy and tasted of bad fryer oil. 

My friend had a cup of soup that tasted like nothing but salt.  Disgusting.

I advised her that this is my 4th leased Honda Civic from them and that I always get a 1st oil change "" free"".  She looked into it and could not find written confirmation, she had a manager named Christine pull the contract and still could not find confirmation, with no arguing at all,  another manager waved the $70.00 Oil change.

"The quintessential college-town-type dive bar with an interesting layout, a big mixed crowd, fun music and plenty of bars selling fairly crappy cheap drinks.

"I can't rave enough Love to Wax more! My auntie has came to see Melissa for years and has always told us wonderful things about her experiences there! 

We are from NM and wanted to have a fabulous spa day while we are on vacation. My sister and I have always been skeptical about getting Brazilian waxes because they just sound scary and painful. This experience was beyond incredible! 

When you first walk in, you walk into the cutest atmosphere ever! It looks like a Pinterest inspired room and it is so adorable! The whole building smells like wonderful pumpkin and marshmallow and makes you feel so warm and safe. Like a beautiful fall day. 

I had my auntie go in the room with me since she's been seeing Melissa for years and it made the experience even more comfortable! 

You go into the back room and she started off with the brow waxing. I'm a talker when I'm nervous and she was able to deal with my ten billion questions and awkward conversations because of my nerves. She's so patient and kind! I have pretty wild jungle madness brows so I was nervous about getting them done since they are pretty weird brows. Melissa made my brows look absolutely amazing! She's so gentle, I didn't tear at all when she did my brows! Then we went onto the Brazilian which I was super nervous about. Melissa is very gentle and educates you through the process which was awesome! The facial was totally amazeballs. It was so relaxing and my skin has never looked better! I left feeling so informed about skin and hair which I would have known nothing about and I have a game plan on what to do for my skin when I go back home! 


Love to Wax is AMAZING and a MUST go if you are looking for a wonderful spa experience! We can't wait for our next trip!",5.0
"If there is such a thing as a waxing goddess then Melissa is it! From the moment I met her 3 years ago I have NEVER let another person do my Brazilian or eyebrow waxing. She is so gentle and makes every appointment feel like you're out with a girlfriend chatting about life! All of my friends go to her and they just rave about how amazing she is. I think what I love the most is no matter how many times I have seen her, at each appointment she asks me what I'm looking for that day which just shows how considerate she is and understanding that people may be looking for something different at each appointment. I always leave feeling amazing! If you are looking for the most gentle, caring and skilled waxing person in Vegas look no further than Love to Wax! I promise you will never look back!",5.0
"This place is a small wonder. Since I am a South Indian, I love Indian food in general both South and North Indian. Most of the Indian restaurants in Cleveland tend to serve North Indian food that is fully Americanized. There are some places where you can get some Authentic taste on certain dishes but the biggest problem at most places is, the food is darn expensive and full of MSG (Mono Sodium Glutamate). Thank god, I food this place. The food tastes so authentic and good. No MSGs. My favorites are Fish Curry, Egg Briyani, Ginger Pepper Chicken, Samosas, Puffs, Vadas, Dosas, pretty much everything. Calling out all Indians especially south Indians, this place is a small wonder. In love with this place and food. Don't miss Indian food anymore.",5.0

The owner was nice enough and the place clean with good seating.

"I do very few Yelp reviews, but I must say something about Desert Nail Spa. I was a walk-in, so I was happy I was assisted immediately. That is when my happiness ended. The tech was okay but filed my nails down as far as you can without causing bleeding (??why??). I got a gel manicure. Toward the end, she scolded me about my nails. I am not sure why. I felt a very negative vibe there--is it because I am not a regular? Was I given a novice tech? I chose Desert Nail Spa because of the wonderful reviews. I observed the owner keeping an eye on everyone which shows me he cares how his business is going. I also observed many techs on their phones/texting. In our small business, my husband and I expect SUPREME customer service--that is what sets us apart. I want this man to succeed (looks like he is) but it might not stay that way with a tech who clearly would rather do something else. My regular salon on Shea and 93rd will get my business from this point on.",2.0
"I had a standing appointment, and I received a call the day before my recent appointment. Karen, ""bumped"" my appointment for another patron who had history of booking more appointments than me.

"I've had many Dim Sum experiences in many different cities across the US.  Although I've lived in Las Vegas or 5 years now, this is officially my FIRST Dim Sum experience in this city.  We came here to celebrate Chinese New Years last night, so Kung Hee Fat Chow.  Or Gung Hee Fat Chow, depending on your dialect.  

The outside of the building transport you to an authentic city in China.  Chinese lettering and a huge sign that read, ""Dim Sum all day"" really brought us in.  The carpet is definitely outdated, older tables as well.  Adding yellow lining lights on the ceiling and you're now transported to 1960's China.  Definitely needs a revitalization.  The staff is cordial.  Definitely not as pushy to sell you more Dim Sum as I've experienced in other cities.  They also explain the dishes thoroughly in English so you know what you're getting.  Here's what we got:

Chow Mein - probably like 4 plates altogether.  A little oily but so good.  Small crispy noodles with grilled onions.  

Fried Shrimp Puff - Got 3 plates of this in all.  Crispy gyoza like dumplings filled with shrimp.  Super yummy!  Served with a dollop of mayonnaise.    

Juicy Pork Dumpling - Watch out!  The juicy liquid is hot so don't just stick it in your mouth so quickly!  Perfectly steamed.

Steamed Pork Shiu Mai - Reminds me of pork hash from back home in Hawaii.  LOVE.

Shrimp Shiu Mai -  Exactly like the pork, just with shrimp.  Still love.

Shrimp Paste in Green Bell Pepper - They actually shaped the paste into a ball and placed it on top of a big square of steamed bell pepper. The pepper was a little odd.

Pork and Chive Shiu Mai - SUPER OILY.  I had to wipe it down with my napkin.

All in all, a little too oily.  My hands were constantly oily all night.  Not the best experience, I've had better dim sum.  Don't take my word for it.  Please come by and see if you feel the same!",3.0
"Dim Sum all day is a great feature. Very flavorful, very warm. I have no complaints about it. 

However, I ate dinner here and the food wasn't great. Everything was extremely flavorless. I don't know if it was intended like that so the customer could add seasonings to their liking, but the soup we got tasted pretty much like water. There was also a fried tofu dish that was pretty much tasteless, although the texture of it was nice.

Service is good. Waitress was friendly and accommodating for anything we needed. 

I would come here again, but for dim sum only.",3.0
"I actually would like to give them 0 out of 5 stars, but since that's not an option....

I was bored from the get-go.  I was in Vegas with three guys - I wanted to do a Cirque show, they wanted to do a burlesque show.  Since I'm not uptight and don't mind watching boobies, I said okay.  It was actually really hard for me to not get up and walk out and I was really hoping something awesome would happen at some point, but it never did.  When we walked out, all three guys told me they were sorry!

The only positive to this came from leaving and running into the open faced poker tables (Fridays and Saturdays) on the way out.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'll return to The Riviera for those tables.",1.0
Absolutely the best place we had to eat in a long time. Highly recommended! Very picky about sushi. Super fresh and tightly rolled (properly). Burgers are fantastic first burger ever I didn't put ketchup on nor did my husband...and he eats everything with ketchup. Fried pickles are the best I have ever had. We like hooters pickles these are 1000% better. Mostly because they are thicker and fried to perfection. We are just driving through tonight but will visit Charlotte again soon just for Cowfish! Oh and FYI the area is really nice.,5.0
"I'm in the service industry myself. That being said, everytime I order hot tea there the server rolls their eyes. I get that hot tea is a pain but I don't roll my eyes when someone asks me for loose leaf tea at my restaurant because it's my job. I'm a huge tea person, so this is one of the big reasons I go there. Also, I feel like their sandwich platting could be a little neater but everything is delicious, so it makes up for the sometimes sloppy presentation and grumpy service. I'd recommend it, I'd just warn my friends of the burnt out servers.",3.0

"This was a strange review to write as the food is top notch and deserves five stars. The only reason I gave it four was due to two issues that will be irrelevant to some people. First, the cheapest bottle of red wine was $70, which I think is ridiculous. I don't think it's asking too much to have a $50 bottle of wine on your menu. I like wine with food, but am not a connoisseur, so the difference between a $50 bottle and a $100 bottle is nil to me. Second, you're much better served going with a group of four or larger. Sides and appetizers state they serve two to four and they are huge and way too large for two people. You will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two people as the seafood bar (more to come later) selections are usually two pounds or more. 

On to the food...amazing. Your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market inside of the restaurant. There is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening. Each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price per pound. Most were in the $50/lb. range. We had originally ordered a Mediterranean Sea Bass, but it was only available at two lbs. or larger, so she recommended a similar selection that I can neither remember nor pronounce, at a pound and a half. Two lbs. would have been far too large for the two of us and we were not interested in leftovers. The seafood was so fresh and simply prepared. It was grilled, lightly seasoned and topped with a little oil. They let the seafood be the star and it is incredible. Our appetizer was the spreads, which included Tzatziki, Hummus, Tarmosalata and Fava. It was great, but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didn't want to fill up on an appetizer. With the seafood we also ordered a side of their grilled peppers. Again, great, but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten. Outstanding meal all the way around, but paid for a good amount of food we couldn't eat. Also, it's pretty amazing that all the fresh seafood can be on ice in the middle of the restaurant and yet no ""fishy"" smell.",4.0
"I've lived in Mesa my whole 26 years of life, and had yet to try this place. I consider myself somewhat of a sub connoisseur since I worked at Ned's when I was 15, but I digress. I stepped inside and was quickly transported back to the 1990's: I mean this place hasn't been updated in years I tell you! I pushed past the cringe-worthy green countertops and was met with a smile from the girl behind he register. I ordered the small smoked turkey on wheat and my first bite was... blasé. Then I quickly realized it's because it doesn't come with cheese! What sandwich doesn't automatically come with cheese? (This is a rhetorical question, obviously the BLT is one.) I then ripped open their regular potato chips hoping to add a pop of pizazz to my palate. Sadly, it was met with more blandness. I mean, I get that they're regular potato chips but in a world chalk full of flavors you have to up your game a bit if you want to set yourself apart... or repeat customers at least! I so badly wanted to like this place, I root for any business in Mesa to succeed but I can't say I'll be back any time soon.",3.0
"Great vibe, great owner - a nice little Persian cafe without having to truck on up to the hinterlands - I am a fan.  

OK, I love this place. A lot. But I feel sort of compelled to ask... WHY THE H#$%! AREN'T YOU OPEN BEFORE 5PM??????

 I know, I know - No dark & sexy before 5pm - BUT - since they already have everything in place to just open the doors early and simply BE one of the best coffee places on College St - Why don't they? Ok, I confess that my ulterior motive is to turn this place into my virtual office - someplace where I can be comforted by the environment and further comforted by the discomfort it would cause to the droids that, quite frankly, make me really uncomfortable.

"Costco, in general, is a magical, magical place.  While there are only two of us in our household, I can always find things to buy in bulk at Costco.  In my opinion, Sam's Club hasn't got ANYTHING on the awesomeness that is Costco.

Costco offers a lot of higher-end products.  I got some really nice cookware and storage bowls from there for a VERY reasonable price.  They have many high-end products they offer here, especially with electronics and small household appliances.  I like that they offer a lot of organic meats and cheeses, although I still find them a little more expensive than I care for.  I really like a lot of their Kirkland Signature products, which are far better than a lot of other generic products I've tried.  They also offer a large selection of vitamins (in bulk, of course) and natural healthcare products.  They also have GREAT prices on gasoline at their Costco member station.

However, there are some days in which their large parking lot is nearly full with people.  On the weekends, it is SO chaotic there, and you often have to wait 15-20 minutes in the checkout lines to get your things.  This part annoys me quite a bit.  So long as I go there on the week days (except Fridays, of course), everything is honky dory about this place.",4.0

There are definitely better places around town that are cheaper.",2.0
"I loved this place!

First of all, I made reservations about a week in advance and I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary so they gave us wonderful seats.  We got to sit right in front of the windows with an excellent view of the Bellagio water shows.  

The food was excellent.  My fiance ordered their romaine salad and their NY steak... I had their escargot and salmon.  Everything was soooooo good.  And best of all: their chocolate souffle.  OMG.  So freaking wonderful.  Their cocktails: orgasmic.  I loved it!

Best of all, we got to meet Mike Tyson who happened to be eating there as well.  No worries guys, I left with both of my ears in tact ;)",5.0
"We went here twice on a recent trip to Vegas. The first time was fantastic -- we were early for lunch, had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the staff was attentive. We had excellent dishes. To my surprise and happiness, they had gluten free cheese poufs instead of a basket of bread. If I could have ordered an entire plate of those, I would!

On account of the nice time we had there at lunch, we popped up there for dessert late on Tuesday night after a fairly disappointing night. We thought that dessert, drinks and the fountain would perk us back up and make a nice end to our trip. Big mistake. We were dressed for where we had originally planned to go, which meant nice jeans and sweaters. I wear semi-religious clothing and that's OBVIOUS when you look at me. Despite the fact that we did not meet their dress code, we were ushered into the elevator (unaware of the dress code, mind you. We are not regulars and it is not posted.) My partner was instantly pulled aside by the hostess and asked what his jacket size was, etc.

I realize they are a nice restaurant and they want a particular reputation. Damn near ten at night on Tuesday, however, is maybe not the time to enforce it, especially as it was not posted, and the downstairs elevator staff did not warn us. I realize we are not swanky. We probably are not their desired clientele,  but given that we stated we just wanted drinks and dessert, they might have stuffed us in a corner and called it good enough? (For the record, we left -- a jacket over a sweater in a restaurant would have been misery.)

Bottom line, they need to post their dress code. And if they insist men wear jackets, then they need to put jackets over girls that are wearing inappropriate outfits too. Otherwise they come across as a badly-disguised meat-market. And maybe, on a weekday night, that's exactly what they are?

I'd still recommend this place for lunch, but I don't think I'll be back because of how badly they handled their own policy.",2.0
"THIS RESTAURANT IS SO CROOKED! They have a crooked staff all the way around, from the host to the servers. IT SUCKED! Worst treatment ever received at a fine dining establishment. In a nut shell, my girlfriend and I waited an hour for a table we requested to be by a window for the view just to have dessert. We didn't mind the wait but when we finally did get seated an hour later, we were asked by the server to move to the lounge area because they can ""ACCOMMODATE"" us there. We even told the hostess that we were just having the dessert and she said it was OK. The server just wanted his tip rather than to do his job and serve. I wish i could rate this Restaurant a big fat ZERO because over all they suck! Yes! i might not have been there to have a full meal, but we deserve to be treated equally. NOT RECOMMENDED.",1.0

Bellagio Fountains the Paris Balloon, and City Center... one could not ask for more... (tip: very pricey)",5.0
"I live down the street from this new restaurant and always wanted to stop by and try it.  I stopped by on a Monday just to find out they close on Mondays bummer.  I finally had the chance to try it out. I was not sure what to expect since I had heard they served a variety of dishes. We walked in to an empty front reception area, but were then greeted by a smiling gentleman. We were seated quickly with no wait time.  The decor was hispanic inspired, la loteria and yet I could smell chinese food! Once seated I could smell seafood too, I was very confused yet intrigued! Our waitress was great very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, we had so many questions.  She brought us chips and salsa that were all gone within minutes. I ordered a margarita i had seen on Yelp and my waitress seemed very confused since I ordered it as Pinta margarita and its actually a diablo margarita! My eye went straight to the chile rellenos and that's exactly what I ordered. My spouse ordered a michelada with modelo negro and a molcajete dish that came in an actual sizzling molcajete.  I was sadly notified that the chile rellenos were no longer available so i settled for the red chicken enchiladas. Both our dishes and drinks were very good.  I will definitely be back to try those chile rellenos! My honest opinion they should just focus on one food specialty, Mexican dishes.",4.0

"Located in Caesar's Palace, this place always seems to be busy.  My husband and I decided to check it out for lunch and there was a 30 minute wait at 1pm.  We decided it must be worth it, and 30 minutes later, we were seated. The entrance is lined with fish tanks FILLED with Goldfish and the rest of the decor is very trendy, hipster, China.  The tables are a bit close together, but comfortable.  I ordered the Hand stretched noodles with pork and veggies.  It was awesome, as was my husband's review of his cold (also hand stretched) noodles with beef and veggies.  My only complaint was the extra 20 minutes we waited AFTER we were finished eating, to get our check.  I finally had to flag down another waitress and ask her to get ours.

"I have to say what are you thinking SMG? You went from comfortable, rocking recliner like chairs, with plenty of leg room,  to a chair right off the exit row of a plane. The backs of the chair are hard molded at a 2 inch recline. The sides armrest are high, hard and unmovable insuring no contact with the person next to you. So great if you don't like the people in your row, sucks if your on a date. And last but not least, you added rows and chairs so the seats are narrow and the rows impossible to exit. In a time when theaters are working hard to give movie goers something better then there home theater why is SMG going retro.

Things I hate: the pathetic lack of identifiable service and the overly loud environment.

Red Room is loud as all hell, drunk as all hell, and dirty as all hell. The bohemian feel is nice, but bohemian service is sub-par. They lack uniform and coordination, so it is difficult to identify them. The bathroom situation has improved from several years ago, at least.

The food though is really The Red Room's saving grace. Their pad thai with chicken and tofu, though it has one additional ""meat"", still comes under $10. The portion size is fantastic as well; finishing it was a genuine struggle.

The dichotomy between the food and service problematic, though it's a fixable problem. I just doubt it'll even be considered, given it was in this state last time I visited, several years ago.",3.0

"staying at the marriott grand chateau was very pleasant. my party of six stayed comfortably in a 2br suite.  

this hotel is indeed intended for the older crowd. around 2am on a friday night, one of our neighbors ratted us out and told the front desk to tell us to keep it down.  which is strange since we occupied a 2br suite.  we were in the common room where there were empty bedroms on either side.  so are the walls really THAT thin that you can hear us a whole bedroom away or were you jealous that you werent working your way towards your own century club?

walking in and out of the hotel you'll see posters for the luxurious rooftop lounge, Sky Bar on the 38th floor, focusing on great drinks and awesome night views of the Vegas strip.  so up to the 38th floor we went for the midday happy hour.  we were eagerly discussing the shots and drinks we were going to order, oh liver, beware. 

out the elevators and through the double doors, there it was - 2 kiddie sized pools filled with all the grandmas and grandpas in their freckled leathery skin. um, what? upon further inspections, there were about 15 lounge chairs, and too many kids. where was the bar?! oh there it was... a cart sized bar station on the other end, where the only way to get to it is to walk right alongside the pool and risk slipping on the wet pool deck.  because we're alcoholics, we decided to move forward and get our drinks.  as the bartender was pouring our shots, i kindly asked her if this was the sky bar, in which she replied ""yup! that'll be $73"".. daaaaamn what kind of happy hour is this?!

also other items to note, they dont do room service, elevators are tricky to operate, and the complimentary valet service (as nice as it is) can take awhile getting your car, which isnt great if you're in a rush.  but this is definitely a family/kid-friendly place to stay.",3.0

All the crepes were $9.99. They were a very decent size and filling for breakfast. First time we went, I had the crepe with spinach, mushroom, and cheese, topped with a bechamel sauce. It was awesome! My husband got a crepe Suzette, which he enjoyed.  Second time we went, we got the nutella crepe.  It was good, but it was almost too rich.  It was only nutella on the inside and topped with whipped cream.  Could have used maybe some fruit inside like strawberries or bananas to cut the sweetness.  We would definitely eat here again. It's also great for people that want to eat and run because you have a busy day ahead of you and don't want to wait forever to be served.",4.0
"It's a good little joint which serves nice tacos. They're not out of this world amazing tacos, but good tacos. This place is great for a quick little bite when you're wondering the streets of Kensington Market and craving Mexican food. Their tacos are not as good as Barrio Coreano, for instance, but they're cheaper. The staff is friendly and fast. I will probably be back next time I'm in the neighbourhood.",3.0

"In a word? 

Omnomnom...

Wait? Is that a word? It's a sound, for sure. And we made it a lot devouring our dinner at this great place!

Fresh, plentiful, tasty, creative. Oh man. I have a new favorite, fo' sho'. A little slower than some places (as others have pointed out) but worth it, I think. They take their time to make sure it's executed perfectly. Service with a smile and we lacked for nothing. 

The shitake mushroom roll was earthy and perfectly balanced with the crunch of veg and a touch of crispy tempura. Served with some tempura fungi on the side, and it's a complete dish! 

The Rose and White Rose rolls have been entered into my foodporn um, brain bank... ;) No rice (perfect for me): it's amazing fish, sauce, and a touch of veg here and there... WRAPPED IN MORE FISH. #winwin

We also had a soft-shell crab roll (the name escapes me and it's not on the online menu) that was similar. More fish wrapped in fish. Really. #happyMuse

We had a few other rolls, including the Rock and Roll, the Firecracker, a crunchy scallop roll (served with additional panko-breaded scallops! Yum!), and an unagi/avocado roll. All very, very good. The sauces were not overly used - Bonus points! - just enough to go with the flavor profiles they were trying to create. No sauce-drowned fishies here!

To taste the fish on its own (as Bentern says in his review, without the ""tacky"" sauce), we did order some nigiri including salmon, tuna, and uni. The uni, my favorite but not that of my dining companions, was fresh, sweet, and perfect. Always a great sign of a great place, IMHO.

Again I have to point out that I like that they don't pack their rolls with rice (and have a LOT of non-rice options). The menu is *extensive* (the online menu is a fraction of the options you actually have). In addition to the sushi and sashimi, they offer some entrees as well.

I don't mind a lack of AYCE because I don't eat enough to make those ""deals"" worth it. However, I could see the draw in having something here... They can be on the pricey side. That said, Friday night we had a hell of a meal between the three of us... a ton of great food, a couple cucumber salads (meh... just a lot of cucumber in a martini glass... wasn't impressed), some soup, and all those rolls. For... 70ish bucks? Three people? Not bad at all for what you are getting.

And now I am hungry... Dinner, anyone?",4.0

I found HD nails when I was passing by the Beauty Supply Warehouse which is next door. I looked them up on Yelp and the reviews were good so I thought I would give them a chance. I went in yesterday for a shellac manicure. I had the please of getting my nails done by Kim who was excellent. She was very polite. Listened to what I wanted and gave her honest opinion also she did such a clean and precise job. She made sure to clean up all edges of my nails and gave me an amazing hand massage afterwards. I would highly recommend HD Nails for your nail needs. I am looking forwards to going back again in a couple weeks.,5.0
"The food is delicious. The service is great! They make it feel like you're a friend coming over for dinner. We love everyone there. In a normal week we are there 2 or 3 times. And since they recently expanded their menu, there are even more good things to try. You can't go wrong with the classics like the chicken pho or any of the different beef pho (my favorite is with the steak and brisket). But getting some of the other dishes usually turns out to be a great idea. My wife usually only get the chicken pho but she's been venturing out and enjoying her different choices. Spring rolls are a staple and the chopped pork with rice (C1 I beleive) is really good. Pour that fish sauce over the rice and go ahead and plant your face in it!

"So since I was out shopping by myself, I thought I would take advantage of the situation and get some breakfast that I normally do not get to eat. So I went to Mekong Marketplace, the SE Asian market center. Wandered around a little and decided to eat at Hue Gourmet, a Vietnamese little joint. I had the Bun Cha Ca (rice noodle soup with fishcake) and an order of 4 Cha Go Tom (pork and shrimp egg rolls). The egg rolls were very good and not too pricey. But the noodle soup was a little disappointing. The noodles were squishy and overcooked, the broth was weak, the veggies were sparse, and the soup had tomatoes in it! Maybe I am ignorant, but I never had Asian noodle soup with tomatoes in it before.....but after doing some research, I found out that this soup typically does have tomatoes and a tomato based broth. The fishcake was ""different"" -- not the typical Asian fishcake you get in most noodle soups. And they gave me a little container of chopped chilis which I dumped into the soup. Big mistake -- they were chopped Thai chilis and now both my mouth and my asshole are burning!!!",3.0

"This is the absolute worst place to get married. We did our ceremony only at Mesa Arts Center up on the Joanie Flatt Terrace, as it was offered as an alternative space through our venue. We met the coordinators Friday evening (the night before the wedding) to do a walk through and a rehearsal, they were polite and showed us where we would be and overall were nice. Saturday was a completely different story. On Saturday, the same women we had spoken to less than 24 hours before, denied ever meeting us. We were told by both Mesa Arts Center and 12 West Main that the terrace would be ours, and all surrounding classes would be cancelled or moved for the hour we were up there; which was a total lie. Not only were there dance classes in the room we needed, a glass blowing class so kindly used power tools during the ceremony and a repairman was very loudly working on the elevator leading up to the terrace. Plus, to make it even better, another wedding was going on and was blasting music so loud the officiant had to basically yell into her microphone. The coordinators from the arts center maintained that they had not showed us any of the rooms and that none of the classes were to be cancelled. They were so unprofessional and rude, you would think they were doing us a favor and just allowing us to be up there, and that we didn't pay four figures to rent the space. I've never been so disrespected, and it was almost unbelievable that they were doing that to us on our wedding day. We booked them because we have always loved the arts center, but after that we will not be returning customers of any kind.",1.0

"This is by far the best go-kart track in Vegas.  Gas powered karts - not electric ones like the other tracks - give you that real racing feel.  They are MUCH faster than the track, so you really have to drive.

Staff is always helpful and friendly, track is perfect for all skill levels (not too easy or too difficult) and it's a great bang for your buck.  Just about anytime I have friends or family visiting me in Vegas and they ask to do something non-traditional (i.e. not gamble, get trashed, hit the strip clubs or spend hours throwing food down our throats at a buffet) I take them to Fast-Lap.  Not once has anyone I've taken not been thoroughly impressed and had a great time.  It's a blast - try it!",5.0
"My uncle and I were feelin' some delicious pizza, and delicious pizza we received. I've been to both locations multiple times and the food is consistently amazing.
We ordered:
-The pizza with arugula and prosciutto (i'm too lazy to google the menu for the name of it)
-arugula salad
-calamari
-400 plates of bread and oil.. figuratively speaking 

all perfect and wonderful! I highly recommend the salad. Get whatever pizza you like, but the salad, you NEED to get the arugula salad. It's life changing. 

 Ok that's enough about the food..... 

The service was SO fantastic! Our hostess/server, Margret was super friendly and hilarious. My uncle has a very silly sense of humour so it was nice to not get any pretentious ""we never laugh or show we are slightly human"" attitude. I want to only go there when she is working. Is it creepy as hell if I call the restaurant and ask if she's working? Probably. 

My uncle kept making a joke about the pH of the water and one of the bartenders came out with pH strips and we tested it at the table...  I thought it was funny, and a nice touch. 
Also the bus boy who brought our bread was friendly and a babe.

"Seasons Buffet is exactly the kind of hidden joint I'd expect to find when exploring eateries outside of the Strip.  And although, it's not really all that totally off Strip, it's far enough away that your efforts to visit them will be rewarded with extra attentive service and better eats.

Best of all, Seasons easily outshines other similarly priced buffets with the sheer quality and variety of their offerings.

So, first of all, the place looks great: modern space with plenty of legroom so not to impend on the comfort zone of fellow diners, a back wall filled with enough tvs to watch the game and the Food Network at the same time, and best of all, each and every serving station is pristine.

I liked finding two buffet items normally not served during lunch: grilled veggies and brisket.  The brisket was tender and juicy.  It was a little under seasoned but if you dab a little BBQ sauce, it's bound to impress.  The grilled veggies were crisp, slightly caramelized, and probably one of the healthiest things I may have ever had at a buffet (is that sad?).

The showcase item was their fish tacos.  And I'll be the first to admit, they are exceptionally done.  The outer taco shell is crisp-ily grilled while the inner shell stays bendy enough to help house, not only the moist and tender fish, but all the fixings that make it so yummy.  My only gripe is that you're limited to only 2 tacos per order . . . which, I guess, in retrospect is pretty smart considering I'd probably go overboard and OD on them.

The desserts were a little disappointing . . . but to be expected for a buffet.  They were mostly bad but not completely terrible.  I was able to finish half a scoop of cappuccino ice cream and a sliver of cake; although, the fact that I don't remember what cake should say something.

Fortunately, instead of ending my outing with dessert I had one last order of fish tacos.",4.0

"Eleven is hands-down, without fail one of Pittsburgh's best restaurants. I have eaten here a number of times and have had nothing but great eating experiences.

Here's a tidbit from a review that I did on my blog (http://intrepidmoves.blogspot.com/) back in October of 2012.

""Seasonal Heaven.... Eleven. was. delicious....I'm a big fan of innovative, fresh food - and that is exactly what this restaurant offered....Being a big fan of beets, I started with a beet salad. These roasted red beets were dressed with a light vinaigrette and were mixed with pumpkin seeds. This was an interesting October touch, unique and delicious, and while overall I enjoyed the meal, the salty roasted seeds made the dish, to me, seem a bit too salty. Didn't stop me from eating every bite though! ""

Dinner is on the pricier side, but well worth it. This is a great restaurant for a special occasion. This summer I went with a group of eight or so people and we had a private room upstairs - one very vibrant woman from Scranton, unfamiliar with the eats of Pittsburgh - just couldn't get over how great the restaurant was. She asked the waiter to have the manager come up so that she could give him her compliments. She told him that she has never been to a restaurant where every single person in a large group like this could speak so highly of each and every single one of their meals. 

The only 'disappointing' moment I have ever had at Eleven was when I was at dinner with the group mentioned above - my friend Maura and I decided to splurge on a pricier dollar bottle of white wine - annnnnnd it didn't come chilled. I generally don't complain at restaurants, but as Maura's mother (vibrant woman mentioned previously) said, ""you tell them, it's a 60 dollar bottle of white wine, and it's going to need to be chilled."" So we took that route - added some please and thank you's - and the bottle was immediately on ice. I wouldn't have expected to have to ask that question at this establishment - but, mistakes happen.

My most recent experience was for lunch at the Tavern (the bar part of the restaurant which has a different menu). Always on a hunt for a good Bloody Mary - I was very satisfied. The bar area is beautiful - high ceilings, dark wood tables and chairs - a very calming atmosphere. I had their famous fried brussels sprouts, and mussels that were to die for. 

What it comes down to is that you just can't go wrong with Eleven. The Big Burrito Restaurant Group nailed it with this place.",5.0
"Just had their sunday brunch and it was fantastic!!!! it was easy to get a reservation but it was on a post steeler game snowy sunday morning. We decided to do the Prix fix which is $25 and includes an appetizer, entree, a pastry basket and a cocktail. Totally worth it!!!! 
 I got the blood orange mimosa and the flute was large (just the way i like it) for my appetizer i got the crispy brussel sprouts (sans the anchovies) and they were AMAZING!!  my BF got the oysters with their house made hot sauce and they were ""orgasmic"" we both got omelettes and the portions were large and the quality of the food was top notch. Our server was very friendly and he was attentive. He even inquired if i wanted a meatless substitute for my entree. Eleven is definitely my favourite restaurant in Pittsburgh as far as consistency goes. The brunch just confirmed it.",5.0
"My permanent eyebrow experience with Rachel at White Lotus Salon in Gilbert, Arizona.

For the last several years, I have been covering up my faded awkward looking previous eyebrow job with my hair bangs hoping that nobody would notice.
Several of my outspoken friends urged me to redo it. So I combed the internet and I even drove out to Los Angeles for a day for a consultation with an artist who had excellent reviews. 
To make a long story short, within my research, I was given the name of Rachel of White Lotus Salon by someone in the same line of work.  I made an appointment and met with Rachel.  She was very professional and friendly. Rachel asked me what I expected and we both worked at picking the right color and the desired shape of the eyebrow.  At the end of the consultation, I was comfortable with Rachel and decided to have the procedure done.
On the day of the procedure, I was very nervous and anxious as I knew that covering up the faded bluish eyebrows and reshaping would be challenging and permanent!  Rachel alleviated these fears by making sure that she explained each step along the way and would have me look in the mirror several times throughout the procedure so I could see the progress being made.
I was very happy with the results. It certainly was a huge improvement as to how it looked before.
Several weeks later, I returned for the follow up visit to do the touch up.  Rachel meticulously took her time in doing it and I can tell you the work is superb.  I couldn't be any happier and I'm glad that I found Rachel. Really, It was a lot better than I expected!

My other doctors just masked the pain with more narcotics but Dr Fabito sent me to have a lot of test done, acupuncture and even a chiropractor over the 6 years I was his patient. He made ever attempt to try to see were my base level was by trying to wing me off the medication but I was not ready! I then added alcohol to the mix which landed me into a detox facility for a short time! I was always very honest with him and scared to death but he made me feel the pain and took my medications back..he did not refuse to treat me he just needed me to come to grips with my pain..after more alcohol and no pain medication it landed me into a 30 day treatment facility at Las Vegas Recovery Center were my life had to change! I am now 4 months clean from any type of narcotics and for the first time in my life I am no longer numb..I  can finally feel again...discomfort a lot but nothing like the panic of running out of my medication!

"Obviously Chuck-E M. doesn't understand Ritos.  You don't go here for horchata, water, or ambience for that matter.  You go here for one of the best green chili burritos in town.  The ""kid"" at the front desk has also been nothing but friendly to me and I go here all the time.  The lady at the front counter is a different story, you can tell she hates being there.  Please let me the restaurant in town that does a green chili burrito better?",4.0
"I previously had written a review giving Bad Sass Backdrops one star because we had a very unpleasant experience when ordering the backdrops. However, when we did receive the backdrops we ordered, we were very pleased with the cloth backdrops. I do not think I would go with them for canvas but I love their fabric backdrops and plan to purchase more from them. Even though I was not a fan at first, they won me over by the quality of the backdrop and how resistent to wrinkle they are. Their prices are very good for the product you receive. The only reason they did not get a 5 star was for the length of time that it took to get the fabric backdrops since they are purchased and shipped from China.",4.0
Worst noodle soups you'll ever find in Vegas. Pretty much they serve you hot water with your choice of noodles. No flavor in the broth. Absolute disappointment.,1.0
"As far as Sports Books go its very upscale but extremely friendly to both genders. Plenty of screens, several different areas for viewing besides the main stadium, and plenty of comfy seating. And for the big ballers they even have luxury boxes. 

But Yelp is all about the food and this place comes through like its name. Its classic Emeril with several items on the menu from his restaurants but he also put traditional bar food items on the menu like nachos, pizza, and buffalo wings. It is the Palazzo not Hooters so don't be surprised with the prices for these items. But like always Emeril's food is on point. We sat at the bar and were a little disappointed because the bar stools were affixed and couldn't sit close to each other. We had the Grilled Beef Rid Eye with horse radish cream and mash potatoes, and the Acadian Caprese salad which came with lightly battered shrimp. 

On a side note what is up with Emeril and his Stinginess with Shrimp. The salad only had two and and the famous BBQ was seriously weak for 15 bones even though its the Palazzo. Please its only shrimp!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The rib eye was seasoned and cooked(medium) just right and the salad was very tasty. I will be going back to see his take on traditional bar food, but overall if you don't mind dropping cabbage on a good meal with your lady and good service and atmosphere then you won't be disappointed with Lagasse's Stadium and she won't be either.",4.0
"Roosters is a phenomenal restaurant nestled in uptown. Went last night right before the bobcats game.  Unfortunately didn't have reservations so our only option was to sit upstairs at the chefs table. This was the best experience and will sit there everytime we go again. Its like being in the middle of hells kitchen only without all the competition and language.  It was an experience to see each address each other as chef, work together and bring amazing food. 3 seats down I believe we had the honor of the head chef/owner (sitting there enjoying food)who checked in with us to make sure everything was up to par.  We started with the cheese and salami pizza which was perfect size to share and tasted wonderful.  We then moved to mac n cheese, chili cauliflower, duck breast and as an added bonus the chef gave us a sampling of their creamy yukon. All were to cooked to perfection and easily one of the best meals I've had in Charlotte. Mac n cheese was creamy, perfect spice on the cauliflower and the duck was cooked to perfection.  We finished the meal with some bread pudding which was also very tasty.  will definitely be heading back soon",5.0
"We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite.

The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had.

"I was doing some downtown shopping and decided to come here for dinner. Entering this place, I was greeted by some great looking girls and they took my shopping bags which was sweet. The inside seems newly renovated and clean having a chic, red and black theme with great seating and a awesome looking bar. There was also a live DJ which was pretty cool. There were many business suits having a drink and kicking it back. Our server was really nice but had a squeaky voice, my friend got annoyed. For my drink I had the peach sangria which was awesome. For appetizers I had the carpaccio and cheese platter since I ended up grabbing a bottle of red wine. The carpaccio was delicious but they happened to forget the cheese platter and apologized for it and immediately brought it out. I have had great cheese platters before but it was strictly appealing for its presentation but tasted too funky for me and did not enjoy. After awhile, I grabbed the filet mignon which was slightly too pink and happened to tell the squeaky server and she happened to justify that it was fine and convinced me thats the way it is. I was unhappy but hungry so I ate it anyways. Also, I just don't enjoy when theres too much peppercorn, which kind of took away from the steak. Along with the filet mignon, I had steamed vegetables and potato purée as my sides and that was great.  I take my steak seriously so I kind of got turned off for dessert. It started off nicely and ended not the way I wanted too. Overall great eye candy and ambience but the food could be better if they listened to their customers needs. You just dont mess around when it comes to steak ;)",3.0
"Ate here for lunch and paid the $15 to skip the line (comes with a glass of mediocre champagne) but it was well worth it.  At $50 each + the $15, it was amazing. Here are things I enjoyed: pesto pasta, rigatoni with red sauce, endless charcuterie and cheeses, fried chicken with honey, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, char sui baos, potstickers, enchilada, bacon waffles, shrimp, sea bass, and every dessert.  I did not like the mushroom and egg puff pastry, it was bland.   Next time I'm going to do dinner, but overall this buffet is the shit.

Btw: the service was HORRIBLE.  I have never encountered a more miserable waiter in my life.  Also, the women in charge of seating people were slow and incompetent.",4.0
"I wasn't impressed. Having been to the Bellagio's Buffet and Le Village Buffet at Paris, nothing I ate here at the Wynn seems to stand out. On top of that, the automatic 18% gratuity charged on groups of 7+ made it $40 each, more than Bellagio and Paris. By comparison, Paris' dishes are more unique and tastier. The Bellagio's desserts blow this and any other place away. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here when I can go to the Bellagio or Paris for better buffets at a cheaper price, unless you're staying at the Wynn of course, in which case you don't care about the price.",3.0
"3.5 stars. Being nice for the 4. We waited in line about 30 minutes which isn't too bad all things considered. Service was good, our drinks were never empty. Everything tasted fine and was fresh, but nothing was super memorable. Nothing I crave but not a bad buffet.",4.0
"- The only thing I have tried here was Lahmacun (#1 on the menu). This is totally different from a regular pizza that you get from pizza piza or pizza hut. Lahmacun came in retangular and very thin slices that were filled up with ground beef. The pizza was extremely flavourful. They also gave me some parsleys, onions and tomatoes that went sooo well with the slices. 
- Portion: can fully feed one person, definitely not two if you are both in the hunger mood. But if you already had some food and want another dish to wrap up your meal, then one pizza should be enough for two people.
- Price: Expensive (about $12 for #1) very pricey since the portion was small, but it was worth it. 
- Place was not big tho, they do provide some sauces on each table.
- It took about 20-30mins wait for a pizza, so if you are in a rush, then you should call in half an hour before.
- Will I come back? definitely yes, I would love to try more of their food.",5.0
"holy moly. i never thought i'd stand in a line for 45 minutes in cleveland to get a gyro of all things. this line was a monster. as was the gyro i got at the end of it.

steve's gyros is located in the westside market among a bunch of other amazing food stands. just waiting in this line brought business to the other stands next to it. we got some popcorn, fresh juice, and purchased and got fresh fish cleaned while waiting! 

most of the wait was because the meat wasn't cooking fast enough for the demand! they had 3 heaters that would spin the meat and cook it. at the right moment the ladies would shave it off and cook it. i really appreciated that the lady would shout out the reasons why things were slow. it just made me a little more patient by knowing that

the pita was a little greasy for me. actually the whole thing was dripping grease out of the foil. but i ate it up anyway! my gyro was so huge and the ladies gave me so much meat i HAD to take some out. there was no way i was going to get a single bite of anything but lamb if i didn't take some out. they loaded it up! the foil could barely hold in all the meat! 

***please note: there is a sign that does say your serving depends on your attitude****
so don't waltz in there feeling entittled to anything. cause you migth get the opposite of what you asked for!

they also have these very strict rules about their business. no cutting in half. no ordering for others. better follow their rules or you'll be leaving empty handed! why? ""because i said so"" as their little sign explains",4.0
"I get it.  Airport food is not fine dining.  No big expectations.  This stuff reminds me of something out of a microwave --- in fact I'm pretty sure that is how they make it.  I'm not exaggerating.

"This place is one of those establishments where people have been true to since childhood, me being one of them. Even will see the local celebs in there from time to time, I have personally sat next to jerry calangalo ( ex owner of az sports teams, probably not spelled correctly) and others on a few notes. They have the perfect shredded beef taco, and I also enjoy there red chile burro, so try the combo. The chips are good and come non stop, I love the spicy red sauce that comes with them, it's tasty to douse pretty much everything you get with this sauce. One not so great thing is that they charge you for every soda you drink, I drink ice tea because of this - ice tea = free refils. They have good service and whenever I come across a waitress that is lack luster, they seem to disappear by the time I make it back.  It may seem tacky in there to upscale scottsdale folk but I think it has authentic written all over it. The food will back it up, great place for you and your family, but seriously stop leaving 1 dollar tips for parties over 3, I swear the cheapskates of america frequently go to Pedro's because walking out I have seen everything from 50 cents to one dollar left as a tip.

"This sushi place has become me and my husband's favorite sushi place on this side of town. When we first came here there was a little bump in the road. But after the first night things started getting better as we went more often. We've become friends with the wait staff and the owner. They are such amazing people. Judy, which is our favorite waitress, has a very bubbly personality and is very sweet. The sushi chefs are working in their stations as fast as they can. Not gonna lie, I personally know one of the sushi chefs, Bryan. An old friend of mine. I'm not the type of person to brag or anything but with the many times we've been coming to this spot, the staff knows us and we get some chef specials from the owner himself. He has approached us and talk to some of the customers. When the owner and the staff found out that me and my husband got married they congratulated us and gave us a dessert of our choice on the house. Even on the receipt the wait staff wrote congrats! 

I was told by my parents to treat others how you want to be treated. So therefore I have treated the people here with mad respect and I get that back from them. 

It definitely doesn't take a big name or a big space for a place to be good in quality and in service. Sometimes it can be from a tiny space that has the best service and good quality. 
Don't take my words for it, try it for yourself.",5.0
"My husband and I visit LV every 1-2 years and always have at least one meal with sushi. Growing up and having lived in Hawaii for most of our lives, we know what good sushi is and are often disappointed...but not this time!

We were in LV the first week of July and my husband searched for sushi restaurants on Yelp. This restaurant is nowhere near the strip, but it isn't a very long drive, either. We got there at about 10:00 PM after we went to a show. It's located in a small shopping center with a large parking lot. 

Although the space is small, it is just right. We were warmly greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. The seating is very close, but somehow it all works. For those who prefer, there is seating at the sushi bar. 

They have a large and varied menu, and we went for the all you can eat. We didn't eat as much as we normally do since it was a little late, but what we had was excellent! Very fresh fish and the proportion of fish to rice is perfect. No skimpy pieces of fish here. 

Something that weighs heavily on our decision to return to a restaurant is the service and Sushi Koma has top notch service. The wait staff continuously checked on us, cleared dishes and asked if we'd like to order more. We didn't even know who our ""waitress"" was because they all worked as a team and waited on all the tables. I give kudos to the staff and management for this. And they were all relatively ""younger"" and extremely pleasant and friendly. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. 

Needless to say, we will be eating here on our subsequent visits to LV and will recommend it to others. I highly recommend Sushi Koma!",5.0
"Ugh.....The ONLY good thing I can say about this place is that the alcohol prices are not bad, thus 2 stars and not one..
We went to see a comedy show, TPB'S Randy and Mr. Lahey, and we're extremely disappointed in the venue. We purchased the VIP tickets expecting a little more due to the fact that they were an extra $50 per ticket.  They had no VIP seating section.  As a matter of fact, several of us just grabbed tables and moved them to the lower section of the floor.  However when the show started anybody and everybody came down and stood in front to of us.  When we first went in we had to stand in another line because they didn't have the lanyards ready with the VIP badges. Then when we stood in line for the meet and greet after the show they didn't even check to see if we had VIP passes and some people got through that didn't pay the extra.  The floors were sticky, the tables were dirty, just not a good experience.  This place lacked the organization that they should have had for this kind of event.  I hope it didn't discourage these guys from coming back.  We were not the only people upset, many were.  What a huge misrepresentation.",2.0
"Went into Club Tattoo just to check it out and look for some new jewelry for my tragus piercing. I was immediately greeted and helped; the gal got the piercer, Headrick, for me and he walked me through the best types of jewelry options. I was excited to get my new piece of jewelry and really excited when he said he'd put it in for me too! He took his time with me and was friendly and personable.
     
     I hadn't planned on getting a piercing but Headrick made me feel comfortable. I decided to get my cartilage pierced; he made a few dots on my ears to let me see the different places I could get them. I really appreciated his creativity and how he gave me a different perspective. Now I'm getting a series of three in a unique spot.  Even though it was only an ear piercing, he was attentive and awesome!!

     Headrick was so professional and knows what he is doing. My piercing was quick, easy, and didn't even hurt after! He also gave me a care sheet where he wrote down the heal time, gauge, date, and jewelry change time. So professional!! And the prices were not bad at all, I'd pay anything to have such professional service, so I think I got a steal!

     I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a professional piercing. I'll be going back next time I visit! I just loved Headrick!!!

"Go and see Dr. Lee !!!!!
I been wearing glasses since I was 11 , my vision started getting worse from myopia , to astigmatism until I developed keratoconus.
I spent thousands of dollars seeing incompetent doctors who just made me spend more and more on ""fittings"" , last doctor made me spend over 1000 dlls on useless hard contact lenses that hurt my eyes and keep pupping out in the middle of my day.
I went to doctor Lee, I took my toric prescription and got a full eye exam, I have to say I love the staff everyone is very friendly and professional so eye doctor visits will be fun and not scary on how much they are going to over charge per every exam, and how much is going to hurt my eyes.
Dr. Lee is amazing, also is a complete expert on toric , bifocal and sketchy prescription with very high powers like mine, I can't literally even leave my house without contacts, he just got it done the first time , didnt freak me out about the keratoconus and he was so open minded because he is a very prepared doctor, he fitted me on color contacts as well , special order for me, and clear ones for comfort while i work at the salon with hair spray, hair color, bleach and lots of chemicals.
Dont waste your money specially if you dont have insurance as me, Dr. Lee will turn your eyes and emotional health into a clear dream.

This place has it in spades! There selection differs slightly from time to time but the donuts I have had are great. The cronuts are excellent, there banana cream pie donut is ridiculous and even though its simple, there donut with fruity pebbles on it is great as well.

"Went there for a Saturday Lunch, service was really slow as the restaurant was packed and they only had 2 waitress. People couldn't place orders or pay their bills, naturally food service is delayed too. There was 6 tables that waited 10 mintues to pay, finally the guy beside me couldnt take it anymore and walks to the cashier to pay; soon as this happens 6 other people do the same, and there was effectively no food delivery or other service until they were done 10 minutes later. 

Finally after 25minutes of wait(reminder this is for lunch) with no tea or soup, I was able to place my order. somehow my waitress did not serve me tea-It's something that comes with every Sushi restaurant so I didnt ask, after my sashimi got here with no tea, I couldn't find my waitress again to ask her for it. I gotta say its a different experience to have sashimi without tea, didnt really like it.

Food portion was average to small, not really worth the price(13.99 or 12.99). my 12 piece sashimi had 9 piece salmon in it, I got tired of salmon by the end and left two piece in the plate. As I was about to pay, a old lady(looks like shes the manager or owner) realized I did not have tea, served it to me and apologized for having too much salmon in my dish. She was sincere, the restaurant was busy, but never the less forgetting tea and have 9/12 salmon sashimi is not something I will go back for. She did not offer me any compensation for my next visit, so I would likely not go back.",1.0

"JB located in the NoDa area is the dive bar of all dive bars. Great bartenders very down to earth & makes great drinks. JB based on some of the locals I've spoken to live by their Mac & Cheese  which comes in different flavors, my fav is the classic which is awesome to say the least. I have to admit that there is A & C squad. From my experience the later it gets the food quality changes. I've come around 12pm on Friday vs 1:30am on a Saturday and ordered the same thing with different results. 

Anyway with all that being said its still an awesome spot and they have events and live music out on the patio. Great group of people and diversity with varying music so a little something for everyone. 

I recommend the Mac and try the wings which are great. The hotdogs and chili are also a fav of  mine. JB also steams their drink glasses which was new for me. Coming from NY, that's not something I've seen in high end bars.",4.0
"I remember the first time I came to this place. 4 years ago I just moved to this side of town and was searching for a decent sushi place. Henderson is littered with sushi places but the good ones never offered AYCE. I understand that but sometimes I'm just in the mood to OD on sushi. 

Years ago they was offering a special for that time being of AYCE sushi lunch for $18.95. We took a chance since we didn't find any good AYCE sushi nearby. This place is literally a hole in the wall, being in the vicinity of a grocery store and surrounded by fast food joints such as Taco Bell & Dairy Queen. Don't let that stop you from visiting. What it lacks in trendy decor, they make it up with a good variety of sushi.

I always take and suggest Sushi Bay for guests looking for AYCE sushi. It's not expensive and the variety will make anyone happy. My sister is a diabetic and they offer enough riceless sushi for her and for anyone looking to cut down on carbs. Sushi is never formed with too much rice (like some other AYCE sushi places) and when I mean variety I mean the sushi isn't replaced with 1 ingredient  and is renamed. 

I always coming when the ""rush hour"" is over for AYCE sushi. If it's too busy you can eat at the bar. I recently ate here for their lunch special too. Their lunch special isn't anything special but is priced for a quick healthy lunch. Some reviews complain about the host/hostess and to be honest perhaps they don't want to talk so much because maybe their english isn't perfect. Who cares though? I'm not paying to talk to them. 

Will be coming back in the future just as long as they keep up the good work.",5.0
"This place is on hit legit. The sushi culture has become so main stream and expensive that its just gotten ridiculous. When I eat sushi I want good rolls and fresh fish. I seem to end up going to places where things are average but the prices are ludicrous. Those places usually have the staff dressed up as Geishas and something in a traditional Japanese gi like a scene from enter the dragon. This place not so much. 

It's small and never really crowded. Some people may look at it and wonder why but to me it means that they don't need smoke and mirrors to entertain would be customers. I dig sitting at the bar. The chefs will put on anything on the TV. It's a plus during baseball season because you can stuff your face for 9 innings while catching a game. Everything is good. I've yet to have something I wasn't a fan of. Then again if your a sushi person your probably down to try anything. My advice drop in with an appetite its worth the price.",4.0

Was sad that there were no Asian dumplings other than some Chinese pork buns. The lamb chops were nice. Not overcooked. And the roast beef was tasty enough. The desserts, again...not much to trumpet except for the mango coconut pane cotta which was so yummy I went back for seconds. Friendly and attentive waitstaff. ......

we got our buffets comped so price to value ratio didn't bother me so much. But if we had to shell out 40 bucks for this dinner buffet I would have been disappointed.

Just few examples - 
* Salty icy king crab legs: totally not edible
* Prime rib with serious lack of flavor: I don't mean put a ton of salt, no. I mean just adequate seasoning to bring out the natural flavor
* Subpar sushi/ sashimi
* Dessert that are pretty to look at but totally deficient in bright fresh flavor or delight to a perfect end of a meal

Why not create a competitive edge with low glycemic dessert selection with stevia (not the Truvia junk... Use Stevia in The Raw) or organic blue agave syrup (Costco carries them), for example? Or how about artisanal ice cream/ sorbet that packs some awesome flavor?

Really, for the money and time (which equals to money) that we spent and for comparative selections out there... Hmmm. 

1 star for ambiance - locational advantage of being at Bellagio
1 star for service - we got our drinks & silverwares and reasonably efficient removal of used plates",2.0
"I haven't been to the Bellagio Buffet in years so i decided to go back for brunch. Everything was good quality, tasty, service was pretty good, they kept the endless mimosas coming...it was a good brunch. Nothing really was that spectacular that it stood out to comment on, but it was still a good brunch spot. One thing that i was completely disappointed with was the dessert section. As i was enjoying my brunch, i kept eyeing those french macrons. OMG, right???? They have french macrons! Who doesn't love em!?? Unfortunately, when i went to get them, they were all gone. Gone, as in not coming back out. We asked and the lady behind the counter said they were done and not making anymore. Umm? Seriously? You ran out of something at a buffet? I haven't experienced that EVER...and i definitely wouldn't have expected it at a pricey buffet at the Bellagio. Totally disappointed with that part of things. Oh well. Meh.",3.0

The staff are polite, and the work they did on my bike has always been affordable and done promptly. A couple of times they didn't even charge me for small adjustments. As someone who loves riding but isn't a ""gearhead,"" I value their advice and they haven't led me astray yet. I was having problems with my tires going flat, and the owner recommended a different set of tires, which turned out to be fantastic - no flats since.

"I've been a customer of City of Phoenix water for a long time now.  I've never had an issue with them in the past.  Bill comes like clock work, never an issue paying online.  I get to use my credit card so I get reward points while paying something I have to pay anyway.

My bill is pretty standard year around, doesn't really fluctuate at all, maybe by a few dollars if I'm doing something different.  I've never been stunned, shocked, or surprised.  I tend to pay more then what my bill is so that I don't have to think about it for a few months, or so that I'm paid ahead if anything should happen like I lose my job.  They never hassle me about that, never try to return the money, they carry the credit over onto the next month so it's really nice about that.

I recently bought a house and had to switch my water services from one house to another.  No issues there, gave them a call, maybe sat on hold 10 minutes tops, my water was turned on the same day, and they provided me my new account # right over the phone.

And considering you don't really have many other options out there, they treat you pretty well.  One thing I've tended to notice about companies is when they monopolize any specific area, they usually start giving crappy customer service and start treating people like dirt because they know you have no other options of where to go.

But City of Phoenix pretty much has the market cornered on water, trash, sewer, and they don't treat you like trash.  They have always been really nice with me personally.  Not sure about other peoples experiences but I've been pretty happy with them over all.",5.0
"I called before arrival to ensure they had my size tire. They had my tire size, where most shops did not. Upon arrival I rang the bell for assistance several times before having to call on the phone to let someone know I was here. When I pulled around back they were able to get me right in. While I was waiting for them to show me the tires I was reading signs they had posted everywhere advising customers there is no warranty and they are not responsible for used tires after you leave and cash only for used tires. They also had multiple signs saying they are not responsible for any theft loss or damage to your vehicle. I mean, the fact that you even had to post this made me uneasy.  The last shop I went to they did offer 90 day money back warranty and you could pay with whatever form of payment. I was too far to go back to that other location so I stayed at Chandler tire. It wasn't the worse experience I've ever had but it wasn't the greatest. All in all I was in and out and the tires that were given to me were decent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here and I wouldn't refer anyone but if you're in a bind and youre close by its definitely a last resort.",2.0

"I scream for BLVD Creamery in the middle of the strip! The way this location looks from afar looks fairly new, clean, & like a fun candy shop. I mainly came here for the adult milkshakes! Only in Vegas where you can walk around with alcohol in your hands, but what better way for a sweet tooth to have a shake that has alcohol in it!

* Verdict:
- Cabernet Sauvignon gelato (4/5 stars): I only sampled this & it tastes exactly like the wine. It was hard to decide between a scoop of this or a milkshake.

- Prosecco gelato (4/5 stars): Tastes exactly like prosecco as well. Next trip, I'll grab a scoop!

- Adult cookie jar milkshake (3&half/5 stars): All the cookie goodness mixed with Bailey's Irish Cream & Skyy infusions vanilla bean vodka. Mix it well & you'll taste a bit of the alcohol, but the chocolate overpowers it. I didn't get much of a buzz out of it, but it was a good casual ""adult"" drink! ($15)

* Serves:
- Ice cream
- Ice cream sandwiches
- Malts & floats
- Candy
- Alcohol separately from the sweet stuff (see refrigerator on the side)

Must be 21+ to sample any of the alcoholic creams of the menu. I'd recommend this for your fun tastebuds, but the price is a bit up there.",4.0
"Came for Saturday brunch with a group. Food took an hour and a half. Food was cold and not good. I got the beef hash which was supposed to come with eggs but the server brought it out without eggs and when I asked she said it doesn't come with eggs. The beef was tough and not good. The food didn't come out together. Many orders were not correct. It took another 30 minutes to get the syrup for the French toast. Overall very poor experience. Bad food and bad service = bad restaurant. Worst of all my companion got a fruit cup that only came with cantaloupe, he hates cantaloupe.",1.0

"Stopped by on the way to school since I thought it would convenient, didn't think much of the place since I have driven past it for years.  It's a small, clean family donut shop with a decent selection.  I got 2 dozen donuts to feed some athletes I coach. When I got to school, I had one before the kids and it was awesome.  Light and crisp texture - great tasting!  The kids went nuts over them especially the blueberry ones. They were still raving about them at practices hours later.

"Starving and exhausted from a night at Chateau, my boyfriend and I were looking for an inexpensive lunch on New Year' Eve. We walked by Ocean One when we saw they  had lunch specials (on a weekend? a holiday weekend no less!) We walked in and saw it wasn't very busy. I didn't get the chance to see the reviews on yelp (gasp!) but we were pretty happy with the experience. We got seated and asked for a drink order quickly and our waitress soon enough got our lunch order. We had the calamari to start, and i had the jerk-seasoned mahi sandwich. My boyfriend got the grilled salmon. The calamari came out sort of looking like a mess, in a pool or marinara and shredded parmesan but it was actually really good. I'd never had calamari like that but it was my favorite part of our meal. The mahi sandwich was great, nicely cooked and the jerk seasonings were excellent. A little spicy but not burn my tastebuds spicy. They came with seasoned fries that looked freshly hand-cut and those were great. My boyfriend's salmon was ok. It came with shredded veggies and mashed potatoes that were also sub-par. But for about $7 each entree, it wasn't bad at all. The service was quite slow, but since the food was great, i think they deserved a better rating than my fellow yelpers had previously given them.",4.0
"Nothing is more precious than my little kitties.  I realize that made me sound like a total crazy cat lady, but admittedly I am!

So when it comes to your kitties health, you want someone to take it seriously!  I've thankfully only had to deal with them twice before.  Once for the round of kitten vaccines and neutering.  I believe for the two kittens it was around $175.  

The other issue I had was that my one cat had pretty gross eye junk (obviously technical terms I avoid).  The vet who saw me was incredibly friendly and very gentle with my little furry friend.  They were able to fill my prescription of eye drops right away so I wouldn't have to worry about it coming in.  About $50 later I was on my way.

"I wish I could give more stars for the unbelievable service we receive from Patti . I can't even begin to tell you the amount of respect and appreciation we have for Patti and Critter Sitters. We adopted a 1lb. Feral kitten named Smudge 2 1/2 years ago . This fur baby could barely walk or hold his head up . He was in desparate need of love and support and nutrition. I had him for only two weeks and had to leave on a trip. I was so worried as it is extremely difficult to trust anyone to be responsible , accountable and dependable in Las Vegas in general . Patti came right over . She genuinely cared about Smudgie and about us . She wanted to meet us and the kitten and discuss everything that we wanted. She fell in love with our kitten and I could just tell she was going to care for him . She was very thorough in discussing the care we felt we wanted for him. She even asked if we preferred tap water or the filtered water from the fridge , cold or room temp . She asked which vet would care for him in case of an emergency . I just can't even explain the comfort level I feel . She has had the key to my home for two years now . I travel quite a bit and trust her implicitly . I even locked myself out of the house one day at 6am and she drove over to let me in ! She is just a genuine human being who loves her clients and their fur babies. There is not an ounce of deception or fakeness in her soul . She is a true angel to animals . She sends me the sweetest texts of my boy every time she visits . It makes me feel good to know he is loved while I'm gone. when I return home , he is calm and happy , so I know she has spent time with him. Patti has become part of our family . Our kitten still exhibits feral behavior and he doesn't take to people easily. You must invest time , love , patience and caring before he shows affection. It took Patti som, but he bonded with her and I feel so comfortable having her to rely on at a moments notice. You really should give Patti a try .Her rates are more than reasonable for the service she provides. SHHH don't tell her . : ) Patti @ Critter Sitters is by far the best kept secret in Las Vegas !",5.0

Japanese decor inside and out. Sushi, nigri, robata grill, and hibachi items on the menu. Ordered a few things off the appetizer and robata grill menu. YUM-O!

Blackened miso cod-- delish and almost breaks down in your mouth as you eat it.

Sea bass - also small portion but flavorful and nearly ""melts"" in your mouth.

Everything was great, as well as dessert. Creme brulee (never a fail) and the sorbet.",4.0
"Had breakfast at TC's this morning and was seated immediately. Very odd considering that it was 10:00 on a Sunday morning and there were a ton of people sitting outside waiting for a table. And no, we did not do call ahead seating either. Felt kinda bad if we did accidentally take someone's table but I was starving and what the heck was I supposed to do?
First thought when sitting down was that the uniforms that the waiters and waitresses had to wear were absolutely ridiculous and unflattering. Waist high mom khaki shorts with pastel polo's and loafers? WTF? The husband and I thought maybe they were going for an Easter theme? I actually felt bad for these poor kids. Yes, I say kids because most of them appears to be in their 20's. I also noticed that none of them were unattractive. I thought the stepford wife description I have seen in several reviews was an exaggeration but I can confirm that it is not. 
I liked that they had a carafe of ice water on the table. Also ordered the pina colada smoothie shoogle. WTF kinda name is that anyways? Well it was decent but there were lots of ice chunks and pineapple at the bottom of the glass that did not get ground up. For my meal, I ordered the farmers market eggs benny with potatoes. It was ok, just mediocre in my opinion. Being that eggs benny is my favorite breakfast, I have eaten a lot of them in my lifetime. This was one just not memorable for me. The eggs were cooked fine and overall, it was ok but the hollandaise was kinda bland not to mention was separating (I could see oil or butter separating from it) and the avocado was a little brown for my liking. The potato's were alright but nothing special. The hubby ordered the spicy Spain omelet with potatoes. The menu clearly states that it is ""drenched with salsa and sour cream."" Yet, when it arrived, there was no sour cream. I asked the waiter and she stated that that omelet no longer comes with sour cream but she would bring us some at no charge. She later told us that the next time we ordered that omelet, make sure to ask for a side of sour cream. WTF? I guess I am just confused as to why they can't just change the description on their menu? In any event, the hub said his omelet was simply k but didn't have enough filling in it. He also said that by topping the omelet with salsa and cheese and then heating it under the broiler, the salsa had a weird consistency and that he would rather have had the salsa on the side cold instead of warm. To each his own I suppose but the fact that his omelet, like my Benedict, was nothing memorable makes me not want to go out of my way to return here for breakfast. I will say that the apple cinnamon jelly on the table was good for the first few bites but it was a bit too sweet and Cinnamoni for my liking. I also didn't even think of it before but one reviewer had a great point about the ""community jelly."" Who knows how many nasty little mutants have licked the spoon or used that spoon on an already bitten piece of toast. 
My final thoughts: As stated before, I would not go out of my way to return. However, if someone else wanted to go or we were in the area, I wouldn't put up a fight to try it again. I would probably order the crab pastry benny next time and see if that is decent although with my meal today, I don't hold high hopes.

PS: I noticed that there were doors separating the rooms so this may be a decent spot to go if you were having a large breakfast party or meeting",3.0

The food is outstanding - never a bad meal. Whether you have the special or something off the menu, you won't be disappointed.

"Trevor, the manager made this experience really good. To be honest we did not get the chance to enjoy our meals in the restaurant because of our time limit. Our company came here during our one hour lunch break and we had to rush getting in and out with only one server on the floor. The manager personally went into the back and helped with cooking, packing, and processing payments. Due to our circumstance we were given a 20% off discount on our meals. Although, we could not sit to enjoy we enjoyed our food to go and it was amazing. It was a bit rushed but considering the circumstance I cannot deduct from the quality and service.

My girlfriend and I also enjoyed how the servers were educated on the dishes and would explain them to us upon bringing them to our table. It was that little something extra. Chef Keller was also there for our dining experience and gave us a sample of a dish and a plate of petite fours to cap off our meal. Both were delightful. The food (we both ordered the tasting menu at $90/pp) was incredible. Chef Keller is a culinary genius.

"I try not to give out too many 5 stars, not because I'm a snob [although I kind of am when it comes to food], but it's because those 5 stars to me, speak of something special.  And Fleur de Lys is something special.  I've never been to Hubert Keller's flagship restaurant in San Francisco, so I have nothing to compare this to, but I can compare it to other places I've been.  This place rocks.

The 4 course prix fix menu was, for me, the way to go.  Yes, it was expensive [$89 w/o drinks], but let's think about this:  If you're going to Fleur de Lys, you almost have to forget about the price.  For 2-3 hours, you just have to get that out of your head and relax.  The 4 courses:

Truffle Onion Soup
Chorizo Wrapped Sea Bass
Braised Short Ribs with Guiness Reduction
Warm Chocolate Fondant Cake

The menu built quite a crescendo until you're knocked out by the decadent chocolate molton lava cake.  The start of the dinner was not light, by any means, but as he courses built, the flavors got more intense and the richness was there without being overpowering.

Great, great restaurant.  One of the best in Vegas.

Yes, it's pricey.  And if you're expecting them to feed you and dab the corners of your mouth with the money you spend, it would be understandable.  But I really have to say that this was an extraordinary dinner and for 2-3 hours, I just didn't let the prices bother me.  I just played few less hours of slots and poker. :)",5.0

"Not your ordinary sandwich! 
Now I have read some of the comments that the sandwiches are over priced, or should I say more expensive than most sandwiches. Well, this isn't your typical deli. First off, if you can finish the whole sandwich I am impressed. I have a hearty appetite and I am perfect with just half a sandwich. That is another half for another meal. Talking dollars here. Now let's break down the Pane Bianco creation:

Fresh Ingredients: There is nothing more important than fresh vegetables, cheese and meats. Pane Bianco hits the mark on this qualification. 

Seasoning: Love the dressing they used on my Soppressata sandwich. 

Bread: Good luck finding a better bread for your sandwich. Delicious and right out of the oven.

Atmosphere: I like it. I know some people had issue with it, but this place is about a simple menu with a simple process to get you seated and eating ASAP.

"So after my Friday mom group I heard that there was a new cafe that all the moms frequent after wards so my friends and I headed over there strollers in tow. 

First of all why this is a hot spot for moms is beyond me since there is hardly anywhere to put a stroller and no where to change your kid in the bathroom (quickly found out when my friend's 6 month old had a poonami).

So the three of us crowded around a table for two and we each ordered a sandwich and drink. I ordered a green tea latte while my other friend ordered a mocha. Not even close. My friend tasted hers and turned her nose saying that it didn't even taste like coffee - it just tasted like frothed warm milk, whereas mine tasted just like coffee but with a tea bag floating in it. Gross. 

So we went back to the barista and told her that the drinks didn't taste right. They then decided to argue with my friend saying that her mocha was right despite the fact that there was obviously NO coffee in her drink - it was pure white, and that that is how you make a green tea latte: with a shot of espresso. 

Now I'm an avid tea drinker, I don't touch coffee, and let me tell you: that is NOT how you make a make a tea latte unless you want a disgusting one. I told her that that is obviously not how you make one because wouldn't the coffee drown out the taste of the tea thus making the whole point of having tea in it useless in the first place? She begrudgingly made it over again.

If it wasn't for my yummy brie and cranberry sandwich the whole experience would have been a write off. If its one thing I know for sure - its not to sit there and fight with the customer especially when you know you're in the wrong, or even when you're in the right, because customers always know best. Especially mothers who need their caffeine fix. Don't fuck with those ones. They'll cut you.",2.0

"So I did it. I stayed at the Plaza for a little staycation for 3 nights for my birthday. Despite all the negative reviews they were having a promotion buy 2 nights get 1 night (wednesday only) free so I said what the heck ill stay there. We paid $90 bux TOTAL for 3 nights..tues wed and thurs. That also included the $10/night ""resort fee"" which is bs. So the fee includes 2 bottles of water in your room for every night u stay, wi-fi and access to the pool and gym.  The pool was fine it was small but it was clean and they played music so I have no complaints about that. The gym if you can even call it that, had a handful of extremely outdated cardio machines and guess what they did not work. Only 1 machine in the whole room worked and it was the 1990 elliptical! They had one weight machine and some dumbbells but i wanted to do cardio so I was disappointed. The wi-fi worked and I got my water 2 nights during my stay I did not get any on my 3rd day. So resort fee is crap. Next the rooms. We got 2 queens in the South Tower and we got a smoking room. Now bf and I dont smoke but we thought if any of our friends came down they could smoke in the room. Bad bad bad idea. The hallway getting off the elevator reeked of smoke then the room was just stank. It was to be expected but even 2 air fresheners didn't help the room smell any better.  The sink was clogged and slow draining the whole time and the bathroom was so tiny. There were stains on the floor and it always felt wet so we had wear shoes the whole time. But alas it is the Plaza. My biggest complaint was that the power was out for a while and when we called the front desk to complain the lady who answered said it was no fault of theirs bc it was ""an act of god"". Did she really just say that? We asked if they had backup generators and they said yes but only for emergencies.  Not that the power going out is an extreme emergency but come on its 100+ degrees in the summer in Vegas and im paying to sit in a room with no air and no tv and ""its an act of god"" is the best you can come up with?

I think the take-no-BS servers may throw some people off though. The crazy lines and debit/cash situation also add to the ""attitude"" labels but that may float your boat",4.0

"I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say that The Mission is ""as good as it gets"" like the five star rating suggests, BUT this place is pretty damn good. I've read some mixed reviews, and was hesitant about spending the money and hitting an off night, but when my wife and I ate here it was fantastic! 

The entry way through the open courtyard is very inviting, the decor and lighting is classic and dark, yet hip and upbeat at the same time. The music does have a surprising range to it, but it all worked for us and it actually added another side to the dining experience that you don't usually find. It FELT like a night out at a lounge and that's what we were going for. The service was top notch: our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food came on time but not too fast. Gave us just enough time in between to enjoy our drinks (I recommend the Caiprihina... I had three and they are super tasty, especially in the hot weather). The manager or owner even came by at one point to ask how everything was. 

The food was delicious, and just like others have said, there are so many things to choose from! We had three dishes from the tapas menu and combined they were plenty of food for us both. We had the duck empenadas, some kind of flat gorditas, and one of the pork belly selections. My favorite was the pork, and although the duck was good, the dough on the outside was a bit too thick and overwhelmed the filling a bit. The flavors were wonderful though, and we left very satisfied and not one regret about the price. Stop by for a fun night out!",5.0
"We went for Sunday brunch, this place is almost perfect, unfortunately we got stuck with the worst server in the place (we could tell because all the tables around us were getting great service).  The setting is ideal, by the pool at palms place, bright with tons of windows.  We felt like we were in a little oasis away from the strip.

You could tell a lot of original thought went into the sunday brunch as there were a bunch of things I'd never really encountered before at a buffet (candy bar, breakfast pizza, pyjama attire, junk food dessert, white trash menu, fresh smoothie bar etc, etc).  Refreshing these days where every bar tends to copy each other by calling itself some derivation of ""social house"" (same decor, same food, same overpriced food, same, same...give me something unique!)

Anyways I'm getting off topic, but all I really need to say is that the simon Sunday brunch is really worth checking out, it's one of the best food establishments I've been to in Vegas.  Perfect setting, delicious food, and a unique concept.  A bit pricy at $38 per person, but I think worth it.  If you want to take advantage of the deluxe bloody Mary bar or the champagne bar it's extra $.

A couple of my favourites from the meal:
 - simon roll from the sushi bar
 - junk food platter, make sure to use the take-out container from the carmel corn to stock up at the candy bar on the way out.
 - freshly made smoothies, i tried a couple and i liked the berry one the best (the chocolate protein one the least)",4.0
"Yes, it is a bit convoluted getting to this place from the Palms casino floor.. two elevators.. long winding corridors.. two moving walkways (lots of twists and turns). But when you do finally get to the place you'll be pleasantly surprised.. for this is one of the best 'casual dining' restaurants on the Strip. Before a concert at The Pearl, we did all apps.. all very good... ahi tuna tartar.. crab-cake (exceptional).. sashimi.. pear-endive, blue cheese salad.. and there's more very interesting items to choose from.  Service was top notch (Stacey).. and the total bill was half what you'll pay in many other places. Do happy hour from 3 to 6 and the savings improve. One note to management.. put a Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc on the wine list and the whole experience goes from 4.5 to 5 stars.",4.0

Extremely friendly ladies working here! I came in to get some ink refills and I was welcomed in and got a great deal on two cartilages. For being my first time I got a coupon off for next time and was given directions on what might happen when my printer reads the inks (didn't happen) but it's always good to be prepared. I was told to call the store if any issues came up and I felt I could instantly call the store to ask for help without feeling clumsy for missing any information. Ink works great no issues and it's been about two weeks now. Definitely coming back when I run out and highly recommend you come by as well.,5.0
"Wow the reviews couldn't be more accurate. This place is the worst! The girls working there are clueless! I went in to try Mac Foundation for the first time (my Guerlain had run out). I explained what I was looking for (sheer coverage as I don't care for matte or dewy look). The girl picked out the mineral foundations and told me to sit down. Told me, not ask me. I humored her and took a seat. She proceeded to spend about ten minutes on my face and when I looked in the mirror I was shocked. Was she color blind? I politely stated that I really believed this foundation looked really heavy on me and didn't look right. It looked really cakey. I asked if she had something lighter and she got really snarky and said ""if I go any lighter you'll see everything and it will look like you're not wearing anything at all"". Ummm that is the point of foundation you dummy I thought to myself but before I could get another word off she walked away and started helping another customer as I am still seated in the chair. Apparently she was done??? So I left the Mac counter with this mess face and stopped briefly at Dior where a very nice older lady immediately looked at my skin and was like ""oh honey sit down let me fix this for you"". It was THAT bad! Save your money and your time.",1.0

"My Monday from hell started off with a blowout on the freeway.  After a quick change-out with the spare, I made it into work where the first thing I did was log on to Tedwiens.com to schedule an appointment.  I received a phone call from service manager, Carrie who assured me she could get me taken care of today and immediately put my mind at ease.  

On my drive over, I couldn't help but think about how I was probably going to get gouged in the repair cost because they knew I was desperate.  After a speedy check-in with a very-friendly staffer, I was elated to hear the exact opposite would be the case!  It was Carrie who again saved the day by telling me my old tire could absolutely be repaired and for only $21!! 
I even think I was in and out of there in under an hour!  I just wanted to give everyone there a big hug.
Thanks again, Carrie (and the rest of the helpful and personable staff!), for turning a crappy day into a great one!",5.0
"This review is for the Automotive Department. I was so happy after bringing my Porsche Cayenne here for a safety inspection to get my Ontario Plates. The service was quick, fairly priced and they gave great customer service. Unlike the service reps at the Porsche Dealership on Front Street.

You guys rock!",5.0
"I'll never understand this place and the logic. They would rather try and charge me a $5 cover charge than to just let me come in and spend $30-$40 on drinks!
     A cover charge? To see a crappy band? 
  They seem to stuck on booking tribute bands, which in my opinion is just about the worst type of band! And again, A COVER CHARGE!
 Used to be a fun place with good music. Not anymore, which is sad since it's so close. 
Maybe someday they'll get a clue and realize charging a cover is a losing proposition.",1.0
"I am typing this review on my iMac, which wasn't possible a week ago. After having the hard drive finally crash, I was forced to get the computer fixed. I learned several years ago that the Apple Genius Bar isn't a bar, and is far from having ""geniuses"" there, so that wasn't an option for me. The last local company that repaired my Mac is no longer in Vegas, so I did a quick Yelp search and found Chaz at MacCure. 

All the reviews indicated the service and knowledge from Chaz was top notch. I placed a call into MacCure and spoke to Chaz direct. He was no nonsense and direct with me on the phone, which I appreciate in a world full of being told what I want to hear, and not what I need to hear. He immediately diagnosed the problem and directed me to purchase a new internal hard drive for the iMac. Once purchased he asked me to call him back and gave me the cost breakdown for what he would do to get the computer up and running. 

After a quick trip to Fry's for the new hard drive, I met Chaz at his home where he operates his business. Chaz was super knowledgeable about all things computers and Apple products, which was backed up by the various Apple certificates adorning the wall of his office. He told me everything would be up and running in 24 hours.

A day later, I was picking my iMac up, which was up and running with the latest OS. Chaz also went through the computer and made sure there was no malware from before. Chaz isn't cheap, which in my opinion is a good thing when you are dealing with data recovery and computer maintenance. Whats the price of all your data being saved and back on your computer worth?

When you need help with your computer system, info technology or other digital devices, Apple or not, give Chaz a call. He'll be straight with you, and if he cant help you, he will tell you and refer you to the right person. I am definitely taking my stuff to MacCure from here on out.",5.0
"One of my friends showed up at my work today with a pink box.  Who doesn't like a bakery box handed to them?  That box was loaded with cupcakes, chocolate peanut butter, red velvet and cinnamon toast.  I only tried the peanut butter today, but the cupcake was fresh.  The icing was delish.  I cannot wait to go to the actual store.  I can see we are headed into a beautiful relationship.

Part II
I was on that side of town yesterday and actually visited the store front. It is like a mecca, walking in there.  Great place to take kids.  There is a wall of candy and a sprinkle topping bar for kids to decorate their cupcakes.   Great idea.  The cupcake flavors are fabulous, they offered vanilla and chocolate cupcakes with all kinds of flavored icings, vanilla, chocolate, bailey's irish creme, frangelica, strawberry, peanut butter and coconut.   Basically bad news bears if you are trying to cut out fat.",4.0
"Decided to come here because of the delicious looking pictures and the 5 star rating. The restaurant was empty with 2 other couples. The space was clean, roomy, and the one waitress was very nice. We found the prices to be quite high. 

With that being said, I decided to order the dumpling ramen. When my dish came, it turns out what appears to be TOP RAMEN! I was very upset paying $8 for this bowl. 

My boyfriend ordered the kalbi rice bowl. The flavour was tasty, but super oily and salty. Moreover, the Korean style side dishes were just bizarre. 4 small cups (mini spicy shelled shrimp, fish patties, flavourless bean sprouts, and black beans?) This dish was a whopping $20.

Additionally, he spent an extra $2.50 for tea flavored water. They must have waved the tea bag over the pitcher. 

Also, this restaurant is billed as a sports bar, but we were watching the local news instead of the NFL wildcard game. 

Should of gone with our gut feeling of eating elsewhere since there are delicious Korean diners down the street.",1.0

The ambiance was amazing, a total contrast from Commonwealth. The bartender came over and sat down to go over the menu, and even adjusted one of the regular cocktails for one of us. No piano player, but a fantastic experience all the same. This will be a regular spot every time I'm in Vegas from this point out!",5.0

The exterior has many picnic tables for large groups with pergolas. The line to order your food, maybe because it was my first time, was hard to find. After wondering around we found it. 

The service, well its ok. Kind and straight to the point. Its a cafeteria line.

I ordered the turkey jalapeno sausage, it was dry with no real character of flavor.  The hot and spicy sauce was not hot nor spicy. The pickle bar was pretty good and I enjoyed the water melon.

This place was a huge disappointment to say the least.  Ordered the machaca burrito plate which came with rice and beans.  Everything was very bland.

"There isn't anything at this hotel that really stands out. The rooms are more affordable than some of the other hotels on the strip, but you get what you pay for. My wife was attending a conference here, so we didn't have a whole lot of say in where we stayed. The standard rooms have tons of popcorn ceiling texture, dated wallpaper and furniture, and the bathrooms are nothing special.

The casino isn't that great either, luckily Paris and Bally's are connected so you can just walk over to Paris for more choices on games and a better atmosphere.

"Semi-fast casual breakfast, lunch, and brunch place. The food is amazing quality, touting organic options, mostly locally sourced, vegetarian and gluten free possibilities. I had the French toast (the top seller) which was a locally prepared hard French bread dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar with a citrus glaze, dipped in maple and a side of fruit. The last had the heirloom tomato (caprese) salad topped with bright flowers. 

The high point aside from the great flavor and freshness was the presentation. One wouldn't expect it from such a casual affair (which has high rolling lawyers and even the Mayor of Phoenix dining on occasion.)

The low point is the portion size which isn't huge but don't let this deter you because where quantity only slightly lacks, the quality makes up for it quickly. 

The owner is a super genuine and nice guy and the staff is happy to help and informative. One of the best local spots we've been to in a while.",5.0
"I came here for some breakfast on a Sunday.  It looked like a good place to try so I came in.  Not being able to eat wheat there is a limited menu but I settled on the Quiche with fruit and an Americano.  The Americano was decent but not as good as my little espresso maker can make at home which I had one earlier.  The Quiche was also pretty good but I could tell it was not baked that day because it was served ice-box cold!  It looks like, for the most part this place is all about freshness and quality.  They even have organic coffee.  If the quiche had been baked that day I don't think they would have needed to store it in the refrigerator.   It was pretty good cold, I imagine it would be great warm.   The fruit was fresh and I'm glad that was cold!

The rest of the food that went by looked really good.  Too bad I can't eat bread because there were a few things I would try here!  Overall cute place and I would come back here again.  I see they have some draft beers here and grass-fed angus burger.",3.0

"I contacted Julie to see if she would be able and willing to do some work on a suit that I needed for a very important interview I had coming up (date and time unknown at this point). I was looking to get the pants hemmed up a few inches, my sleeves shortened, and some alterations made to the shoulders to prevent them from protruding out too far. She agreed over the phone that it would be no problem, and I met up with her at her place in order for her to take my measurements. She explained her pricing (very fair) and that her average turn-around time was one week. This was on Monday morning.

On Monday afternoon, I received the call from my interviewer saying my interview would be held on the following Tuesday at 7:00am. I immediately called Julie and left her a message saying that I would definitely need my suit by that Tuesday at 7:00am. Based on her previously quoted week turn around time, I didn't imagine this would be a problem but I understood it might still be a tight crunch, and that's why I called to let her know.

On Thursday of that week, I called her again just to check and make sure everything was OK and on schedule. Again she promised that everything was fine and it was all going to be OK and that she would ""definitely have it ready by [my] interview.""

The following Monday at 11:42am, I received the text message: ""Hello Eric... I have completed your pants and 1 sleeve... have to get ready for work now but I will finish this for you I promise... it will be ready for you for your interview for tomorrow."" I texted her back and asked if she had any idea of when it might be ready, but I didn't hear back from her. 

So, at 10:30pm that night I called and spoke to her. She said she hadn't started working on it yet as she just got off from work and she informed me that she had also decided not to do any alterations to the shoulders like we had originally agreed on because she already shortened one of the sleeves the full length and if she made any further alterations to the shoulder the whole sleeve would come out too short, and she didn't want to bother with having to undo the sleeve hem she already made thereby having to start over. Seems to me that if the sleeve length is, say, 2 inches too long and you have to take the shoulders in  1/2 inch, you'd only alter the sleeves 1.5 inches to allow for that extra half inch at the top (""Alterations 101,"" right?). Instead, she offered to finish shortening the second sleeve and call it a night and said I could bring it back to her at a future date and she'd do the shoulders for free. I reminded her I needed it for an extremely important interview in a matter of 8 and a half hours. Much to her annoyance, she said if I was willing to wait longer into the night, she'd go ahead and undo the first sleeve, redo them, and alter the shoulders like I had originally requested.

At 12:44am I got the following text message: ""Ok so I truly don't think the shoulders will be done... I finished everything else but the shoulders are a bit complicated once I got in there... so sorry. Anyways I am done so we can meet somewhere half way."" She gave up and declared her work ""done,"" without having followed through with what she said she would.

Around 1:30am my wife picked up the suit from her and paid her. She made it home around 1:45am. The pants hem was fine, although the pants themselves were horribly wrinkled and creased. We never agreed that she would iron or press them, so I wasn't expecting differently, though the extra touch would have been appreciated especially considering the following, additional shortcomings:

The sleeves were altered terribly. The stitching was very sloppy--loose and very uneven with lots of free-hanging loops and zig/zag clusters. One of the sleeves had a large cut in it at the end that rolled from the outside onto the inside. I can't tell if she snipped it with a pair of scissors after it was altered or if she gashed it first and then continued to go about sewing it up and allowing it to show on the outside. Either way, ""Alterations 101"" fail again. If it weren't for the dark, late night parking lot pickup we might have noticed this before we paid her and probably would have only paid for the pants.

I have included a screen shot of the text messages we shared and pictures of the terrible stitching and damage--I sincerely hope Yelp lets them stay up. If they aren't there, feel free to contact me and I'll be glad to send them to you. Cannot recommend her any less. She makes all the promises in the world but lacks any of the ability, skill, or motivation to complete them. Look elsewhere.",1.0

It's pretty good if you're watching your carb intake. Nowadays if I ever get anything here it's the protein shakes. Overall the food is okay it isn't bad. Service is your average you order at the counter and on your own after type. My main turn off about this place is how overpriced it is vs portion. You can easily go elsewhere for cheaper meals and just as ""healthy."" If you are too lazy to cook at home after your workout and don't mind spending the money... then this place is an okay choice.",3.0

Although I'm not sure if that's what it was called. The ingredients were lemon, cucumber and mint! In a souffle right ??!?! This was so amazingggggg, so refreshing  , delicate, light... elegant.. ! All in one!",4.0
"It's safe to say this has become our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is incredible. We just returned from some time in Italy and this is comparable to the old lady window made pasta of Rome. 

On top of the food being fantastic, Howard, our server is funny, attentive, and knowledgeable. We keep coming back. 

Thank you for the wonderful ambiance, service, and food.",5.0
Great bar that brings back the old school vibes of Chicago. Met the owner over the weekend and you can tell why the poace is so beloved. Great drinks and beer selection. A must if you are in the PHX area.,5.0
"I had a below average experience during my first time at The Duce. First off, 2 of the menu items I asked for they were either out of or they no longer serve.  The salad I ordered for 7 dollars was as basic as a 3 dollar add on at a comparable restaurant.  The challa bread brisket is a great idea and tastes pretty good.  The alcoholic beverages are unique and taste great. I will also mention that the items in the vintage store are over priced.  The clerks there are not very friendly, in fact, they kept starring at my group of 4 as though we were going to steal something (which was very far from the truth). I may not go back, but I recommend that others check it out purely for the unique venue and good drinks.",2.0
I contacted Fabian to remove some patio furniture and miscellaneous junk. I received a great quote and he showed up on time and took care of my needs quickly. I will definitely use him again and recommend him to others.,5.0
"I love the food here and the fact that they deliver is also why I am loyal to this restaurant.  If I feel to lazy to drive over there, I know I will get the same delicious food delivered quickly to my house and it will be still hot.  

Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly, we love the fried rice and tofu dishes.  There is a lot of variety for vegetarians.",5.0
"I have tanned in their versa spa four times with a 5 time pass. This last time they upgraded me to the bronzer (normally a $10 up charge) they did give me that for free because I stated I didn't get any color the previous times. This time was not much better. Barely a darker color for around three days, then gone. I don't know if it's the formula they use but regardless, I wouldn't spend any more money on their spray tan machine.",2.0
"Worst VersaSpa tan I have ever received in my life. I've had well over 20 in the past 3 years to know how to get a good one. Never have I ever had a problem. I came here in December and had some weird color difference on my back side and thought maybe it was something I did wrong. Went to another salon a few weeks later and didn't have an issue. Came back to this salon yesterday and ended up with my legs being extremely streaked, my arms are about 5 shades darker than the rest of me, the backs and insides of my arms have almost zero color, and there is a terrible, terrible difference in the color of my hands from my arms. One arm is even noticeably darker than the other and one leg is a lot darker than the other! It seems as if my right side didn't receive as much color as the left. I noticed the color issue immediately and even felt like the machine had not sprayed my back side properly (you know how it feels and it definitely didn't feel as if as much solution was sprayed.) I went to find the receptionist to ask about how to fix this and could not find her anywhere. I waited for another five minutes and still couldn't find her. Highly disappointing and now my skin looks absolutely terrible. Never coming back!",1.0
"Volo is one of the best beer-centric bars in the city. They do things that set them apart from the competition. 

This place is not only a craft beer mecca but also doubles as a brewpub. The folks at Volo brew their own beer under the monicker ""house ales."" In addition to their own concoctions, they also have a large selection of draft beer (over 30 taps). What I like about their selection is that it is almost exclusively Canadian beers with the vast majority of beers on tap being from Ontario, it's always great when bars support local brewers. 

Despite much of their draft beer being local I did see some beers that I had not seen before. Volo tends to carry many one-offs from local brewers and on the occassion that I went even had some collablratove beers from local breweries. In addition to the extensive taps list they do have a pretty exotic selection of bottles, however these are a little too pricey for my liking so I tend to steer clear of them. 

The owners of Volo are also the brains behind the annual cask days festival, they have a yearly IPA challenge and often have special events such as tap takeovers. They certainly get bonus points for being one of the champions of craft beer in Toronto. 

The place itself is pretty intimate, and has a spacious streetside patio. There is no waiter service so one has to go to the bar to get drinks. The place is usually buzzing but the service doesn't seem to suffer, the bartenders are always willing to make suggestions and certainly know their products very well. They have a small uninspired food menu which is ok if you want a snack but you come here to drink not eat. 

They are located within walking distance of Wellesley station, very easy to get to by TTC. Overall this is a Toronto gem, and one of the top 3 places for craft beer in the city.",4.0
Our main drain backed up on christmas eve. The tech who came out to fix it was Cameron. He was very professional as well as knowledgeable. He fixed the problem very quickly and identified things to keep an eye on in the future. We are very happy with the service and will only be using this company in the future.,5.0
This bar is pretty decent and usually has a decent crowd. The price of beer is pretty standard and the staff is okay. The best thing the bartender's have going for them is there pretty good looking. The are not that fast to take an order however. I will say I'd probably be back again so I'll give four stars for now.,4.0
"Went here because the UofA Phoenix alumni held a viewing party for Wildcats baseball game.

I agree with the other reviews: they are understaffed. They had 3 waitresses for about 40+ people. I was disappointed because they took 50 minutes from taking our drink orders to our food orders. Even after writing down what we wanted the waitress still forgot what beers my friends' got and we had to check up with the girl after 15 minutes and had to repeat their drink orders. Service got better at the end of the night (made sure our food was ok, refilled our drinks, and split the checks without complaining), but the beginning of the night left a bad taste in my mouth.

Food was made quickly but it was nothing to brag about: our whole table ordered burgers and they are all just slight variations of one another. Even the salsa/chips appetizer was mediocre: most of the chips were crushed up and the salsa seems store-bought (other sports bars I've been to have made their own salsa, so call me a snob I guess).

One bright side was that there was an open bar for 30 minutes after the Cats won. But overall, a less than pleasant experience.",2.0
"We went for restaurant week.  They were packed. We had an inside table but asked if they could accommodate us outside. They basically turned a two-person table into a four-person table with some effort. We really appreciated that.  The owner personally came out to help with this. Then we talked to him for a while.  Incredibly nice guy and very proud of his restaurant.

The four of us mixed up what we ordered. The first course were tapas and everyone got the same thing.

We then mixed up what we got on the second course.  Everything was awesome.

There were two desserts on the menu for restaurant week and so we split those up as well. Again, both desserts were great.

Service was also good. Perhaps a 4, but we liked the food so much I'm giving an overall 5.",5.0
Amazing Mexican food and great servers! Love this place and would recommend it to anyone I know :),5.0
"Maybe I just don't understand the trendy fine-dining scene, but I am from the school that says that if you pay a good amount of money, the food should taste good and there should be plenty of it.

I knew we were in trouble when I ordered and the waitress asked if we were sure that was all we wanted, because their portions are small and what we ordered probably wouldn't fill us up.  I told her we'd start with it and see how we felt.

She was right, but my biggest issue was the taste of the food.  The kani kani was good, but the consomme was very fishy.  And the Hawaiian Hamachi, six frito-sized slices of fish spread out as much as possible on the plate, were next to flavorless.

All the reviews I've seen on this place have been good, so it's quite possible that this is just not my kind of place.  I'm sure the quality of ingredients were top-notch, and the atmosphere of the place was fun, but when I'm hungry, what can I say?  I want food.

We had a couple drinks and said uncle.  The bill came out to about $65 before the tip, but I think our experience there can be summed up by the fact that we ended up walking over to the nearby deli at the sports book to actually eat.",2.0
"Me and my girlfriend and two other friends ate at the Japonais Lounge because we saw there was a 3 course meal for $45. You got to choose 2 appetizers, 1 main course and 1 dessert. 

We opted for the tempura shrimp roll and lobster spring rolls to start. In addition I ordered the calamari. The tempura shrimp roll was a little different from what I'd had before, the shrimp was extra crispy but still very good. The lobster spring rolls were actually lobster egg rolls (fried) but still very good with rock lobster inside and a mango salsa to go with it. The calamari was also different, instead of a fried breaded calamari it was slices of lightly pan fried squid with a sweet sauce. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was definitely tasty.

Our main course was a salmon dish, I can't remember the name but it was salmon on top of mixed seafood with a horseradish leek sauce and risotto. This was a high quality dish with many thoughtful elements like chopped up shrimp, a little rock lobster and oyster.

For dessert we had the chocolate ginger mousse cake. This was a top-notch dessert. The presentation was fantastic, I still don't know how they created the cylindrical little tower. The exterior looked hard yet when you dug into it, it was very smooth. Towards the bottom were thin layers of chocolate cake.

This place is probably too expensive to go to if you're seriously hungry, and the service didn't help. We were really the only ones there at the lounge but the food took a while between courses. Maybe the people in the restaurant get priority. Good thing we weren't in a rush. Overall high quality food.",4.0
"I like Chase, though with the roof closed, it has a bit of a warehouse feel to me.  But with the roof open, and the clever way the outfield walls swing open, it really feels close to a conventional outdoor stadium, and that's a good thing.  Free wireless now, which I think is a recent thing, and it actually seems to work (unlike Jiffy Pop stadium in Glendale, where you're lucky to lock onto a signal for more than 30 seconds).  Decent grub selection (far better than Jiffy Pop, which is horrendous IMHO).  Take the train and avoid the parking cost and hassles.  Go DBacks!  (unless the Giants are in town!).",4.0
"Had dinner last night during their soft opening and had a very good meal with great service.  Overall great selection on the menu and all of our food was very good.  On the positive side the Caesar salad was excellent and the pork Milanese was very good.  In addition, the bottle wine selection was a really good value considering the overall cost of dinner. 
A couple of negatives were the seating by the outside patio was very cold, our table was not leveled and some of the prices seemed slightly high (not a deal breaker but something to consider). 
Overall I will absolutely be going back and trying out some different menu items and this is another great addition to the North Central dining options.",4.0
"Went in today  to try a new place for breakfast. I had corn beef hash and eggs with sourdough.  I think my 9 year old could have made me a better breakfast. The only reason I have 2 stars instead of 1 is my daughters' lunch, mini burger w/fries, was decent according to her. 
It's nothing fancy and the service was okay. They are pretty cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. Definitely won't be back. As cheap as it was, still not worth the money.",2.0
"By all mean, it's okay. A bit pricey for things that they offer but they are quite tasty. 
Paeya (not sure if the spelling is right) was big not as good as I expected to be. Cavier dish was good but something anyone can make at home. Try them if you really like spanish food!",4.0
"I love the convenience of ordering and paying online , that way I don't have to wait at the restaurant. I ordered the half Mediterranean salad, gyro plate and gyro sandwich with Mediterranean fries. The portion size for the salad after adding feta and olives was just the right size. The pita bread was tasty.  A little bit thicker than I like it but good. The gyro meat was seasoned perfectly and the tzatziki sauce was tangy and creamy. Totally enjoyed every bite. The fries were seasoned perfectly and very good. Too bad there wasn't more! Overall I would say for the price and taste worth every penny. I'm looking forward to trying this place again.",4.0

"I love supporting local shops that are such staples to the community. This place had families, couples and groups of friends stop by. There is really nothing that beats a cool treat on a warm day. For all my friends out there who can't have dairy. They have an awesome vegan selection including some flavors such as raspberry, mango, strawberry and dark chocolate. I went with with dark chocolate and it was rich and decadent. They also have other dairy flavors such as chocolate malt, pistachio, roasted banana and a matcha flavour. The service was friendly, quick and I love how they topped off each order with a piece of waffle. Stop by if you are close by, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
The burger I had at this cafe inside the Red Rock Casino was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life!  It arrived hot. It was juicy. The bun was baked on the premises and toasted.

Very close to Gastonia, NC , walking distance to the Hertz and Avis lots, excellent service from the welcoming and competent staff (one of the fastest check-ins I've ever had at any hotel), fantastic bed, extremely clean bathroom, excellent food in the concierge lounge, marble top furniture, live plant in the guest room, beautiful artwork throughout the property. I still can't believe I only paid $109 per night. My only complaint was the airport shuttle, which is shared with a number of other hotels and makes a number of stops before getting to the Renaissance.",4.0

"Review Summary: Get yourself the sweet potato tots NOW! Everything else is just decent.
I stopped in for lunch today and ordered the PM Burger, which comes topped with pulled pork, beer cheese, and deep fried jalapenos. The burger patty itself was cooked perfectly to medium as I asked but was surprisingly a little dry and lacked flavor on its own. The onion Kaiser bun was okay but nothing special either. The toppings on the burger were what made it good though. The pulled pork added solid bbq flavor but was also a little dry unfortunately. The beer cheese was awesome, and balanced the bbq pork and beef patty perfectly. The deep fried jalapenos were limited in number and weren't breaded very much (which I'm glad about), and they provided a decent level of spice and another complimentary flavor. The toppings made the burger pretty good but not great; if the bun and meat quality had been better this burger would've been killer!
The best part of the meal was by far the sweet potato tots! I love sweet potato fries, and these were probably the best I've ever had. They were sweeter than most places with a hint of cinnamon, crispy outside but with a normal texture in the middle- outstanding!
The service was decent and my food came out quickly. The atmosphere seemed like it would be pretty cool, especially at night, and the location has a very large bar but not a ton of tables, which I guess should be expected from a place with ""Whiskey Bar"" in its name.
One last piece of advice to totally drive the point home: order the sweet potato tots; don't even consider another side. Yes, they're that good and were definitely the highlight of the meal.",4.0
"I'm VERY picky about Indian food, and I like it spicy! I was initially nervous about ordering from POI after reading the previous (older) reviews, not to mention my failure to find good Indian food so far in da Burgh!  I'm glad I took the chance:) Delivery was as expected through grub hub, about 60 minutes after the delivery was placed. I added a comment to ask if they would ""please make (the food) very spicy."" And they did not disappoint! Usually my request for very spicy food (a 10 on a spice scale of 10) gets me something more like a 4 or 5 on my personal spice scale. I was so pleasantly surprised that the chole and aloo gobi were made both flavorful AND very spicy. (Literally brought tears to my eyes!) This, however is the kind of spice I like, so for those who can't handle it, be mindful of the spice scale- it's taken seriously! I'm so happy to have found Prince of India delivery and will be trying it again soon.",4.0

"We had the great pleasure of dining at the South Beach location-that was amazing.
We went in with high expectations. Not only did we elope the night before so we were still on cloud 9 but we were looking forward to another memorable experience as we had in SB.

We started with an uncomfortable table that included a small chair and bench seating. I asked to sit at a different table-pointing to one that included chairs with more support, explaining I had a bad back/disability. The hostess was quite rude and I didn't care much for her lack of compassion. We made the best of it, again focusing on enjoying our meal.
Our chicken and waffles were disappointing. Chicken batter was soggy and not crispy at all, as described in the menu and as we had in SB. Waffle, under cooked, so the bourbon syrup just sat in the top.
Our server was inattentive and disappeared for extended periods. We waited for and had to ask for water several times.  I was never able to order another glass of wine due to the lack of support from our server.
We did not complain to management, paid our bill and left. The food was good, but given our expectations from the South Beach location and our special occasion, we just wanted to pay our bill and leave.

There are A LOT of choices in Vegas. It may be wise to step up the service and food quality for future patrons.",1.0
"It's rare to dine at a restaurant that truly is run like a well oiled machine. Everyone we encountered was genuine and embodied the true spirit of hospitality. Our server Ken was very well versed and provided truly friendly service our entire meal. He even had a nice dessert for my fiancé put together that was very well received.  One of the young ladies bussing, Shaniqua was very sweet and attentive.  It truly felt that everyone we met was nice. The Restaurant Manager Sarah was also a delight to meet and speak with.  We had multiple quality conversations with her and our love for the restaurant only grew.  She has a great attitude and it's very clear that she knows how to run a restaurant; food is a huge factor but hiring and maintaining quality staff is key. It was refreshing to witness such a high level of professionalism with everyone and of course the menu delivered a unique experience we will without a doubt return to very soon.",5.0
"Came here late Friday night (had a reservation) and the place was not super busy. We were seated at a tiny table for 2 and were promptly greeted by our server. 

This place does family style southern food (with a twist) and so the meals are meant to be shared. We decided to try a few things - chicken/waffles, Salisbury steak (that was my husbands strange choice), with sides of Mac and cheese, cornbread and grits. It was WAAY too much food but we wanted to try a few menu items. We were informed some items require additional cook time. They do, however bring the food out as it ready so you can eat other things while waiting. 

The food was ok. Chicken was crispy and moist but lacked flavor. Waffles were waffles. The Salisbury steak had an overpowering taste and the grits were dense. We left a but disappointed - but for all we got it was only $100. 

The service, much like the food, was average. The waitstaff work together so various people came by to refill drinks, clear plates and bring food. 

Would we return? Probably not. We kept lamenting that we were not eating the delicious chicken and waffles from LoLo's (in the Phoenix area).",3.0

"I'm lukewarm about Chelsea's. Love the patio, front and back. Love the noisy chatter. And love wasting time with wine and friends for hours here.

But I have to say I'm not thrilled with the food. The veggie options are ok, at least there is more than one choice. The flavor is less impressive though. The veggie tacos were blander than bland. The actual veggies are lovely and change seasonally: spaghetti squash, mushrooms, peppers, etc. But can I get a little salt and pepper on these bad boys? They tasted like nothing.

The veggie burger is the same as LGO, but was perhaps prepared differently. I didn't get any of that smokey goodness I love so much at the sister restaurant. The guacamole was also lacking. Good thing they brought out a few orders of those little handmade tortillas though, cuz those suckers are melt in your mouth deliciosos.

There is also a happy ending on your way out with some killer sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Between the wine and cookies, I'm good. Just wish there was a little more oomph to back up the price of the meatless fare.",3.0

"First time partying outdoors!  The club was beautiful.  Definitely appreciated the seats that were for free compared to the other clubs we were at in Vegas.  We went there for their splash dance thursday that was alright.  The crowd was more relax and it was more of a chill and drink kind of night.  The dance floor was really small which I think they should make it a little larger with all the room they got there.  We enjoyed the free drinks until midnight for ladies.  We actually left to try out another club after 2am because we wanted to party and it just felt a little to laid back for us.  Still an awesome club, I would like to go back on a Friday or Saturday to see how the vibe is.",4.0
"I have a love/hate relationship with the Pei Wei chain. Before this place opened I would go to the Gainey Ranch location because I love their patio and when the food was right it was all good relaxing on the patio. But I discovered that they were inconsistent where sometimes I would like their food and other times I wouldn't like it. 

So the wife thought it would be a good idea to abandon our normal Chinese place to try Pei Wei during their first week of operation. They had about 10 cooks woking up a storm and unfortunately I drew the short straw when it came to picking the cook to make my dinner. The meat was tough and inedible. I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore. 

Luckily I was able to crawl back to our Chinese place and let them know that they didn't have to worry about Pei Wei taking away any of their customers.",1.0

I'm also very picky when it comes to middle eastern food because I've spent considerable time in Israel and Taza doesn't disappoint.

"The amount of late night spots that I am starting to Yelp, makes me thing I should create a list. Fatburger deserves a place at that table!

Having lived in SoCal for a number of years, and now, once again, Sin City, Fatburger is a staple for late night grub. The location on the strip is open 24/7 and is the perfect choice when you are trying to nurse yourself into zombie mode. I say that because, sometimes, Vegas can be too much fun, and you are near a coma-tose point. 

Being a Zombie would take some sort of miracle. Fatburger, can be that miracle.

On my way home from the club the other night, I got hungry. There really isn't too much in the way of convenience at 5am near my place (I can't wait to move to the Strip). Thankfully, this Fatburger location popped up like an oasis in the desert.

Feeling ""healthy"", I decided to order the Turkey Burger. With Bacon. Clearly, I wasn't in the right frame of mind, but whatever. It was late.

Yeah, it was delicious, amazing, and the whole nine yards but the reason I give this place Four Stars is simple. Convenience, speedy service, and a clean restaurant.

"This is more of a 3.5. They have huge bruschetta and a nice outdoor patio area. A platter can easily feed two people. Their cucumber lemonade is delicious! 

It doesn't draw the same amount of people as the restaurant next door which is why we picked it. I'm not sure why we were made to wait 20 minutes (I needed a table for 10) for a table when the table we sat at was available when I put my name down. 

I should have checked before I paid for the bill but they mistakenly charged me for a couple of drinks.",3.0
"This place is amazing. The food is what I would say is very authentic tasting food with the right balance of flavor and heat.

The dish will feed two people for sure. The seating was a little tricky it was Sunday and it was packed the mariachi group was playing and families where waiting to be seated but after about ten minutes of waiting I was seated.

"Overpriced. I usually love seaweed salad every time I order it, but not at this restaurant. The seaweed was awful and the tofu was overwhelming. I had the vegetarian sushi, which was nothing special. Good cold sake. Buy the bottle, it's cheaper.",2.0
"Perfect spot to grab a bite to eat before you head to a game! The weather was nice so they had the big garage door windows open making the place feel open and airy. 

The food is good for bar food. I had a salad and was very impressed by how fresh the ingredients were. The rest of my table got wings and burgers which all came with a mound of waffle fries. 

The service was on the slower side but not anything that would stop us from returning. Overall, very good experience!",4.0
"Quoted me $139 to fix a broken screen on a two-year-old Samsung S4. That's DOUBLE the price other places are asking. What kind of ridiculous pricing model are these dudes using? I can buy a new phone for the price they quoted.

"My husband bought me a nutrimill at Shar's Kitchen for Christmas.  My mom also bought me a mill for Christmas as well. So, after comparing the mills I decided to return the nutrimill for a refund.  Luckily my husband kept the receipt and we had all the original packaging.  Upon bringing it back I was shocked to discover that there are NO REFUNDS at Shar's.  Are you kidding me?  
Name one other store that does not refund your money when you return an un-used item in perfect condition with the receipt, in the original box, with all the original packaging, within a week of the purchase.  

I like to support local businesses, even if it means you spend a couple bucks more, but this will be my last purchase from Shar's Kitchen.  

By the way, I even let her know I would be writing a review about my experience but she went on about how her return policy has been in place for 34 years....  Well, maybe it is time to revise it.  Very disappointing.",1.0
"My husband and I discovered Thai Suan Thip just this week as we decided to drop by Mojo Bistro - only to find it was now a Thai restaurant. This was actually pure serendipity - as I wanted Thai - but Niki's Thai Restaurant in the North Side was not open yet (we went by around 11 and it didn't open until 11:30am).

As it was very early, and a weekday, the place was charmingly quiet. We were treated not only to exceptional food, but also got to know the executive chef!  She came out and explained her approach in making each of the meals.   And to paraphrase, she does not americanize the food by adding ""flour"" and ""other ingredients"" that are not authentic. 

The food is amazing. The unique layering of flavors in the spcies and fresh ingredients really impressed us.  We went with some standards (sampler tray, chicken satay) for our starters, and then tried one of the chef specialities.  Being as it was lunch time, and I am/was 35 weeks pregnant, we only ordered one plate to share. Everything was amazing. We left with a full, but not weighted down feeling!

The background the chef provided is that she grew up in Thailand and served in the air force there until 10 years ago, when she met and married her husband (who also works at the restaurant).  She came to America with her husband, but returned to Bangkok for formal culinary  training. Her goal is to bring real authentic Thai food to the area. 

The food was so amazing - we ordered takeout just two nights later!  When we picked up our takeout, the place was busy with the happy buzz of customers.

I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant - and I am so glad it's only a mile away!",5.0
"We hired the TIN kitchen food truck for our event this past weekend and everyone loved it! They were super helpful and communicative during the planning phases, scouted the location a few days before so they could figure out where to park the truck, showed up early to set up and the staff in he truck were so friendly and excited about the food. The food was great, the people were fun and I'd recommend these guys to everyone! 

I had the chicken tacos and masala tacos and went back for seconds... So delicious!  Thanks TIN kitchen!",5.0
"Went to the food truck rally this Friday and tried these guys out. I had the chana masala taco, Thai coconut curry taco and also the BBQ pork taco. All three were delicious my favorite being the chana masala taco- the blend of goat cheese couscous and chick peas with the curry sauce is to die for! The Thai coconut shrimp taco was lacking on the shrimp and could have used some more something? I am doing a low carb diet so I just wanted to eat the fillings and asked for a fork but didn't get one, no biggie cuz my hands worked just fine :). The staff were extremely friendly and I was told they started their tacos off with the BBQ one and it had some very good flavors with some complexity to it. The day was pretty
 rainy so we didn't get to enjoy the surroundings but it was worth waiting in the rain for. Also, the tacos were on soft corn tortillas which I've never been a fan of I normally prefer flour if I'm going for carbs.",5.0
"Stopped in to grab a bite after a trip to the neighboring Target. As far as TB's go, this is one of the cleanest I've seen. The staff was friendly and our order was up in quick fashion.

"Ok, so I'm in town on business and Scottsdale is just a little, hmmm...shall we say blonde, silicone and tanner for my constitution. Ahhh...TT Roadhouse = Remedy. I walk in, and it's kinda Cheers-ish. The bartender Chris is a freakin' sweetheart, makes me a sick drink, and I thrill to the sensations of Nude Nuns with Big Guns and we (me, the random chick from NYC, and the die-hard locals who call the joint their living room) tell a few pointed,  completely un-PC jokes about rape+kickstand in context to said flick. I've had two drinks now, more folks arrive, all nice, and all totally welcoming to the outsider...none of the ""Y'all ain't from here are you"" vibe. Seriously, this is my new local when I'm in town. I even bought the fuckin' T-shirt, and that's just the kind of douchery I never engage in. That said, I think if you're into low-brow/dives and want to enjoy that with a side of super nice.

"Love at first sight. It's not often that you have a quaint little winery in this area that also has wonderful wine selection. Surrounded by some warehouse and plain storefronts this cute little house stands out among the local scene. 

Walking through the front door I feel deeper in love with the homey and rustic decor. We sampled most of their wines before deciding on a glass.  We took a look around and they also have a tasting bar upstairs with a little more a formal decor.

They have a kitchen that offers a small menu of great shareable plates to enjoy with your drink of choice. We split a panini and flatbread both outstanding! We took a seat out on their beautiful patio filled with plenty of seating. I could not get over this gem of a place. It felt like I was on vacation in wine country.

This place in one of my new favorite spots for so many reasons. If you are into more than just sipping wine they also offer a variety of events such as yoga and live music.",5.0

"It's a chain, but a pretty good one...

I've eaten at this Keg a few times, but there was a Keg back home north of Seattle that we'd go for special occasion family dinners sometimes, so The Keg has always held a special place in my heart. 

You'll get a very good meal here. Not to the level of a Fleming's or Morton's, and not even close to a City Hall experience, but you also don't pay anything close to what you pay at those places, which is nice. Two people can have a nice dinner and a glass of wine each and get out for $75 + tax and tip. I typically get the filet meal with a Caesar salad and twice baked potato. They also have good ribs, and my wife had the prime rib once and seemed to like it. 

The ""Keg Dinners"" are the way to go, since they're all under $30 and come with a steak, a side and a salad. None of the a la carte stuff that kills you at other steakhouses.

Service is always attentive, even if you sit in the bar area, which makes that a nice option when it's a 45 minute wait. The drinks are good, and their desserts are tasty and well priced. We've had the creme brulee a few times, and it's quite good.

It's really close to where we live, so we're here occasionally. There are better steakhouses out there, but The Keg is a really good one for the money.",4.0
"The pros: excellent location,  great ambience,  a variety of seating,  diverse menu,  reasonable prices, awesome happy hour

The cons: not the best service in bar area, so sit in restaurant section

Came here with a colleague to catch up on life.  We got: Philly roll and Vegas roll, both really good,  Vegas roll was one of the best ever.  Mozzarella tempura: like a jalapeño popper but way better. Sesame chicken: cut small,  crispy, delicious but maybe was over cooked. Tokyo mojito: get cucumber version. Food and drinks were yummy.  I'd go back again.",4.0
"Lunch special shoppers: Be aware that the bento box special is not available on Sundays! And I don't know about you, but I loose track of the ""names"" of the ""days"" when I'm road tripping. Tip: check the paper at your hotel. 

Our waitress pegged us as budget-conscious due to our interest in the bento box, so she steered us toward selections that would add up to a comparable price. We ordered the spring rolls (fried, delicious, yet small), and a chicken curry. I'm usually wary of curries at Japanese places due to it's over-sweet and goopy. Not the case here! The curry was light and spicy, the chicken tender, and the veggies fresh and crisp. 

When we walked in, we were literally the only people there, but several tables seated while we ate. This was probably at 100pm on a Sunday. We didn't try the sushi, but for some reason I have a feeling it's decent.",3.0
"We were seated promptly and entertained by a one man show of hostess, bartender and waiter. Our waiter was a very polite young man who we decided to test in his bartending skills. He served us with a house cocktail called the Inferno Margarita which was jalapeño, liquor infused cucumbers and tequila. Definitely the best part of the meal.
The bread served to us was unfortunately very dry and so dry that the accompanying oil did not help moisten it. We also got the pretzel and chorizo dip which was ok but not particularly remarkable. We also got the shrimp tacos which was also good but not particularly impressive. Overall will return for drinks but food needs to improve.",2.0

"Kinda surprised to see such bad reviews--I thought the rooms here were really nice! The bed was very soft and comfy, and everything was totally clean. Had all the amenities I expect from a chain hotel, though we didn't get a chance to try out the tv or the pool. Despite proximity to airport, it wasn't at all noisy. As of Aug 2014, the rooms had free wifi, although you could upgrade to a higher-speed option for a charge. 

Downside: having to pay for parking. I was honestly shocked that a hotel would charge for parking from its guests: who knew? Also we had a little trouble finding the place--it is technically close to the airport, but the streets are kinda tricky and the GPS was unhelpful because of the many close/overlapping/unnamed roads. Look at a map before you try to find it.",4.0
"Snobby, refined, exquisite, hipster, authentic, comfortable, delicious, and pricey.  All those adjectives apply here.

"When the play we were trying to see sold out, my friends and I weren't sure where to go to hang out.  We walked by this place and all decided this was it.
Compared to the suburban versions of this chain, the vibe of this place is a bit odd.  It has the atmosphere of a bar (at least in the evening, when I was there) - and it IS a bar.  
However, I had a sundae, and it was pretty good.  Nothing mind-boggling, but certainly worth the $6.00 it cost!  
The service was pleasant.  We were informed that my friend's Belgian waffle would take extra time, which was nice.  And the waffle was worth the wait - delicious!

"Ive only lived in vegas for 18months now and even though I go out almost every weekend I still havent been to the same show more than once. That is until the night I took my gf to see Absinthe. 

I explained it was an intimate freak show where the front row runs the risk of decapitation during a few events. She wasnt convinced but promised me to keep an open mind.

Its been about a year since my last visit and it was great to see some new acts and faces. The girls are very sexy and the male performers are equally impressive.

Be prepared to be offended as they cuss almost every 10mins and even go down the risky racial road but its done in such a way as to not overly offend anyone. 

The gf tensed up, gasped and even covered her eyes once as the acts are done with little to no safety nets. She left saying it was one of the best shows she has seen and she has been here over 10yrs.

Ok now for my complaints. The seats are uncomfortable. Bring a cushion as they are folding chairs that are strapped down and cant be moved. You are only there for 90 mins so its not that bad.  The lights could be better as you are often looking upwards and being blinded by the stage lights.

Its a highly recommend show as far as this local is concerned!",5.0

"I'm not at all familiar phoenix but very familiar with food and good food is a real treat when you stumble across it, so stumble I did. 
I disembarked the metro to attend the Art Walk unaware of my surrounding (Landlubbers wouldn't fully understand) only to round the corner and see Verde, OH happy Days. 
I do my homework by reviewing the pulse of all things good, so weeks ago when I arrived back from sea it was Mexican I was Steering towards so with the help of yelp I knew then I had to try them out. 
It was such good fortune that I had landed on that platform or who knows when I might pass this way again? 
Matt (co-owner) greeted me poised to go the extra distance as I ask what he recommended (common amongst many in the BIZ) and when he said green chili pork I knew he must also be psychic for that is just what I had been thinking weeks earlier when first reading the reviews at yelp. 
It was a true good eats experience from watching my meal's fresh tortillas being made, to savoring them along with small bite constructed combos alternating between the elements that made up my engaging heart's blissful delight. My tongue was experiencing such delights and my senses were as vast as the seven seas that I call home. The Verde isn't just a restaurant serving good food but a testament to the passion of its people and it shows by them going the extra distance, or maybe it was just the intoxication of the fresh wood fired tortillas and the great people gathered around that fire? 
I'll be back since I know now how to get there. Phoenix is now just a little bit smaller and Verde is now a lot bigger since as a cook I'll take the fond memories with me while trying to recreate the dishes without their special flame on the vast ocean I call home.",4.0

"Bad experience here with their FISH & CHIPS!  I was very upset and disappointed with the food I ordered.  I couldn't eat my fish at all.  After the first bite I could tell that the fish WASN""T FRESH, was OVERCOOKED and covered with THICK BATTER.  I even thought that they did deep fried it twice that was why it looked burnt and hard to chew.  I don't think i'm too old to chew the battered fish fillet.  

However, I was too silly to not send it back and asked for another one as my husband told me to.  I thought they wouldn't treat me with a nice dish anymore if I say something.  So I packed it back home and threw it away.  (- -"") now I regret it and I am still upset!

It would be better if I talked to our server in the first place... and it might be my bad to order something that shouldn't be ordered in breakfast restaurant!  If I ordered classic breakfast, I would be satisfied, I guess.  Anyway, I would rather go to Lakeview or somewhere else next time.",1.0

Authentic Italian food! Best meal my husband and I had in Vegas. I had the  lasagna and it came with a side salad and two pieces of bread. My husband had the Italian sausage.

"I came here to fix my ipod touch 1st generation. At first I was pretty upset because I didnt hear from them for a few weeks, and when I called to check up, they acted like they had no idea my ipod was even there and the phone number they had put on my file was something TOTALLY different than what I had given them. They said they would call me back the next day and then I didnt hear from them for about 2 more weeks. 

So why am I giving them 5 stars? you are probably asking yourself.
Well, when they did finally call me back, they were super apologetic, they let me know they had tried everything to fix my ipod and they just couldnt. 
They asked me to come in so they could give me a 2nd gen. ipod touch free of charge because ""it's the right thing to do"".

"There are many better casinos!!!
I stayed at Caesars for 1 week (Sun to Sun) - paying for a sleeping room, daily coffees; snacks, Nobu and one of the best but most expensive buffets ever.  During this trip I also dined at other fine establishments and for the remaining (3) days of my visit I gambled in other casinos.  So I dropped plenty of money at Caesars between the room, food/beverages and gambling!  I am unique gambler in the sense that I am comfortable giving my money to the casino as long as I get to play!!  So I made a donation every night to Caesars for the first 4 nights - on the fifth night, I played and broke even.  Ecstatic not to have a lost, I went to cashier to cash my chips!   That is when I discovered that Caesars treats the ordinary gambler as a second class citizens!  I waited over 20 minutes to cash in - 20 MINUTES!!!  Why.....because I was eighth in a growing line of people in a non-platinum corral.  Initially there were 3 of 9 windows open NONE OF WHICH was the window marked ""all"".  This meant that every time a cashier was available the platinum people were selected and the non-platinum people remained stagnate.  I get the purpose of platinum status and the privileges associated with being an elite member of a casino, airline carrier, etc. etc.  But when the fourth window was opened and it was still marked platinum and service was continued to the platinum members over the growing line of regular folks, well I along with those around me became infuriated!!!  Let me point out that out of all windows, most were marked platinum, a couple gold and only one ""all"".  This is understandable, but NOT to have a single ""ALL"" window open is completely unacceptable!!!  I complained to the teller who was not interested, I spoke to a pit boss who suggested I speak to a manager, a manager was summoned and he suggested I fill out a comment card as he has no control over the cashier station!  
I begrudgingly completed  my stay but for the remaining (3) nights I refused to gamble at Caesars, refused to eat at Caesars and would only purchase my first morning coffee at the Starbucks at Caesars!!  This ""common"" or aka ""all"" gambler will NEVER stay - NEVER gamble at another Caesars own property in Vegas or Jersey ever again!!!",1.0
"Not bad for an old relic. This dinosaur of a casino is actually a lot nicer and more modern than what I was expecting. The suite I was staying at overlooked the pools and was located in the Palace Tower, which is one of the newer towers (the Palace Tower opened in 1997, while the Augustus Tower opened in 2005 I think). The size of the suite was roughly the same, if not larger, than a standard suite at the Palazzo. But, the bathrooms are much nicer. There were 2 bathrooms (his and hers) with a 2 person shower with 2 shower heads joining them. The smaller bathroom consisted of a sink and toilet, while the larger bathroom had a toilet and bidet, sink, and hot tub. The suite was tastefully decorated with modern furniture. The king-size bed was comfortable but a little softer than I prefer. The view from the 11th floor was decent -- overlooking their pools, but there's not much else to see except the other towers and I-15. My only complaints are that the hot tub was extremely loud (like having a lawn mower in the bathroom) and it took close to 10 minutes for the hot water to kick-in with the showers. Other than that, the suite was amazing. It was a little bit of a hike from the parking garage and the signage could be improved but it's well worth the trip. Caesar's has done a good job staying relevant all these years among the mid- to top-tier hotels in Vegas. Although their clientele is definitely a mixed bag of high-rollers and some... um... not-so-high-rollers... and everything in between. They may not be in the same class as Wynn/Encore or the Bellagio, but they're a good option if you're looking for a hotel one or two steps down from that.",4.0
"If I could even give them a zero star, I would. The sad thing, I have never even stepped foot on this facility. But, after the way they treated me on the phone and the terrible customer service, I can only imagine how the food would be and how you would be treated in their restaurant. So, what is my grief? On the 3rd of May, I was driving home on my motorcycle down Hacienda and I am about to make a left turn onto Jones, when their Fiat with the plate number SKH2 almost hit me, not even paying attention to the road because he was to busy reading a piece of paper. I try to chase him down, but he runs a red light at Russell and Rainbow. When I get home, I called their restaurant and asked for a supervisor, I got hung up on. So, I called a second time, asked for a supervisor again and explained what had happened, they hang up on me again. The third time, I called they finally took my number and said that their supervisor would contact me the next day. I guess they forgot to tell the supervisor. If this is the way you treat people, then that just show how your customer service is.",1.0

Not overly smoky with just the right amount of spices. We grill and smoke often at home and this restaurant exceeded our expectation. The owner is very sociable and chatted with the patrons the entire time.  You can tell he has worked extremely hard to make this place happen. I love it here, charming place with excellent food, try it out!!",5.0
"Oh the 99 cents only store. First off, things may be labeled .99 but the register rounds it up to an even dollar. Not really a big deal, even for a frugal shopper like me. The biggest deterrent to coming here would probably be the admittedly sketchy neighborhood but there was a security guard at the door who also wandered out to the parking lot so that's a good thing. The store was quite clean and well stocked and even had a few refrigerated fruit items which caught me by surprise. The reason I visited in the first place is because I heard that they carry a very difficult to find brand of potato chips called Poore Brothers out of Phoenix. Now that I've visited though, I can definitely see myself coming back! (As long as it's not night!)",4.0

"Food was okay. Ordered our burgers medium rare and they were served medium well. I understand the need to cook meat through for food safety. But... If the meat quality is good this shouldn't be an issue. I don't like medium well, which is why I ordered medium rare. It is stated on the menu that the burgers are served medium well.  Don't ask how we want it done if that's not a option and you are going to serve it the way you want, irrelevant of how we order.
Service was good although another issue is if you're paying by credit card, we were told to swipe the card at the order machine on the table. Our server was good, but isn't that his job?  
With order machine at the table and paying ourself, the wait staff is less attentive and drinks were slow to be refilled or reordered, oh wait we do that ourselves on the machine in the table. 
Customer service is lacking, maybe I'm old fashioned, by why are we tipping if we are doing the ordering and paying ourselves?",2.0
"Picked up take out from here for the first time. I've known about this place for years and don't know what I waited for.

"Great dinner before seeing Seinfeld at Caesars!  Jerry is even painted on the wall, as are many of the other Caesars performers.  
Bread basket:  loved the cheesey bread and the pretzel bread
Wine:  great bottle of Cab, we ordered one of the cheaper ones and it was excellent 
App:  crab cakes were phenomenal  (me) and okay (my husband who said my homemade ones were better!)
Entrees:  filet oscar AMAZING!!!  Check out my photo...and all of the crab you will see!!
New York strip was good (my husband's), but both of us agreed that mine was definitely better than his.  So, the moral of this story?  Get your steak oscar style!!!
Side: cream corn brulee, really good and really unique
Dessert:  no room!

"They say the best places are the ones that are hidden in little shacks and huts. Well this place doesn't get more true to that saying. It is small, hidden, and tight. But they have the best tasting Vietnamese noodle soups in town. Being one of my native pallet cuisine's, I get picky with Vietnamese food, usually my AUTHENTIC places are in the west end of Toronto, near Jane and Finch. Don't ask why the best Viet food is always in the rundown ghetto, just usually go eat and bounce. 

Now this place Bong Lua is pretty unique. Aside from the traditional Pho, Bun, Com, they actually have  signature dish. It is called ""Bun Dap"" literally sounds like what is spelt there, it consists of a ""guon"" cold rolls with a twist. You get to choose the grilled meat you want, then inside has Lettuce, pickled carrots, vermicelli, herbs, peanuts, smaller thinner rice paper, and shrimp crackers. When you dip this ""Noc Mum"" fish sauce, crunch of the cracker and veggies and grilled meat is very satisfying. You may think ""Damn too many layers and must be a mix of confusing textures"". NOPE! It actually works very well, when you are still able to differentiate the different layers, and flavours. 1 order is enough to share for 2-4 people as an app and enough for 1 to be a meal. Almost like a BIG MAKI roll, but Viet and lighter! Oh and try their curry goat/lamb, it is very on point and satisfying. They make so many homemade dishes that a lot of restaurants don't make.

Overall this restaurant is awesome! soups on point, quality is consistent, and portions are HUGE! if you go as a couple I suggest get 1 regular size noodle and 1 app, it is more then enough food for 2. If you do feel ambitious to order the larger bowl then, please let your friends know they will need to carry you out. 

Friendly reminder, they don't take reservations, and it is a small place, but people come and go fast. Spare some time to wait during peak hours, and they dont open late, but it is well worth the time and money.",5.0
"This was probably the absolute worst place I've rented a U-haul.  I rented a trailer for 1 day, not even 1 day.  It should have cost me $29 plus tax.

"The customer service we got was super friendly. Seems like a small family run business which I liked! I got two pastry desserts while we were here: the napoleon and the fruit cake. The Napoleon was very flaky, custard filled, and delicious. However, the fruit cake was still frozen.... It was 11:30am and they opened at 10am. They still didn't have all of their breads ready for lunch time. I ordered the Da Vinci, but they had to substitute the original bread with whatever they had which ended up tasting stale.",2.0

I had slight regret from being very full after, but otherwise I would do it all over again. Way to go Chef Stacey!",5.0

"This is primarily a place for drinks and cocktails.  If you're looking for a memorable food experience, this is not the place to go to.

Having said that, the current menu is not at all like what is posted on the website.  The current slate of dishes are mostly Asian-fusion inspired, and rather lack-luster, that I feel they should have stuck to the current website menu.  And also makes me question why they opted for such a drastic change.

Anyway, if my memory serves me right, my friend and I ordered the following:

...half-dozen oysters, I believe they were from New Brunswick (the bartender shucking them didn't know what he was doing, and left shell fragments in the oysters)... 
...some sort of cold noodle salad (a take on a Vietnamese salad), which had some avocado, shredded cabbage, and sweet vinaigrette dressing...
...a torched beef tartare, that had an interesting creamy dressing on top, and was ""Asia-fied"" with sesame oil...
...and a scallop and pork belly, with a taro and chive mash (the scallop was too salty, and the pork belly was a puny strip...c'mon, really?  Skimping out on the pork belly?  That stuff is pretty cheap)

These dishes should be considered tapas, because the portions were quite small and extremely pricey for their size.  In fact, the dishes were so small, that my friend and I paid our bill as quickly as possible so we could drive down the street to grab burgers from Burger's Priest, before they closed for the night.

Normally, I would provide photos of the dishes, but the ambient lighting was too low to get any decent shots.  Overall, a great environment for drinks (as their menu appears to be catering more towards beverages), but if you're looking to get a decent meal I would recommend opting for somewhere else.",3.0

If it was bottled, it would be in my pantry.  I had the lasagna which was meat laden and although it was the lunch portion, I had enough for lunch the next day.  My husband had eggplant parm which he raved about, and again brought home enough for a second meal.  Hot garlic rolls were too good to pass up.  The side salad was so-so, but very fresh.

"I've heard mixed reviews about the place, but I was in a crunch and needed to have access to food quickly right after my workout. I ordered online for a 11:30am pick-up. The wait at the cashier was a bit long, but that's expected during a lunch rush. What I didn't expect was once I finally got my Smoked Turkey and Avocado sandwich and sweet potato fries, that everything was mushy and cold. I'm assuming they made my order as soon as I placed it and it had been sitting out for awhile. The flavors were there, but I was really disappointed by the state of my food. I haven't had any reason to go back since and I think next time I'm in a jam, I'll probably end up at Greens & Proteins instead. Maybe one of these days I'll try to order in person and see how it fares. 

This isn't a knock on Rachel's Kitchen, but their customers need to learn how to drive better and not randomly talk in the middle of the parking lot while cars are trying to pass through. This location is in a tight parking lot and Rachel's Kitchen is one of the first businesses in the strip mall entrance. They're always zooming out too fast, parking poorly in spaces, or backing out without checking if anyone is behind them. (sorry/end rant)",2.0

"If you have a Papillon do NOT groom it here. I have a papillon who's black has faded to a beautiful brown giving him nice layers of different colors. 

We told them NOT to cut any colored fur and only to cut the white fur on his belly (because it's unsanitary when he pees) which they did not do.

I pick him up and the fringe around his ears are gone! They cut almost all the black around his face which will take up to a year to grow back, obviously not listening to the instructions I gave. I had a word with the groomer and she tells me it's NORMAL to cut their fringe!!!

What world does she live on?

You would think they would know a thing or two about how different breeds coats are supposed to look and that a papillon means butterfly in French! They are MEANT to have fringe around their ears because they look like butterflies!

AWFUL experience. They are scissor happy, inexperienced groomers who have no idea what they are doing and do not listen to instructions!",1.0

"One positive, the bartender was on top of it. That is where the positive experience ends. My group was here in the restaurant to eat some food and not watch the fight, thus got a table away from all the TVs. They still charged a $10 cover even though there was maybe 10 minutes left in the fight when arrived and no clear view of the TV. $7.50 pitchers we found were $14 after the pour. Could not get a waitress to serve us food. The lady who collected the $10 had a smart and vindictive response to everything. Bathrooms smell horrible. Maybe the worst experience on Blue Diamond? Maybe this place has a better and friendlier wait staff at non peak times? Would not recommend to anyone who wants a cheap drink and good atmosphere.

@Glen - Take things personal much? How about not mocking customers and be situational with it? If one person asked if there was a problem at the time, that would go a long way towards displaying good customer service. Just saying.",1.0

"This is not a place for the calorie conscious, so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague. Even the salads here are smothered in bacon, eggs, cheese and dressing. But if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion, I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong. 

This place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.

Once inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order. 

I decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!

And. It. Was. Heaven.

It's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added. 

And everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.

I only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings. It's cheap, delicious, friendly, and some of the best damn hang over food I have ever had.",5.0

I ended up ordering the Greek salad and he ordered the wings. The lollipop wings are a joke, not much meat and certainly not shareable. There aren't too many wings to begin with and they charge a lot for them. For the price, I would think you would be served a little more. Looking at other tables their burgers and fries look like larger portions. My $16 salad was mediocre. Will not return.

"First time visit on May 9th. The place was packed-shouldn't have visited on a Friday night but I was craving some sushi.

SERVICE
We had a server named Marc who was just awesome! He was attentive and after telling him that it was our first time there, he ordered some of the most popular appetizers and rolls for us to try. They were all terrific!

FOOD
While our server was super amazing, kitchen people were super slow. We waited over 30 minutes for our sushi. Yes I understand the place was packed but I've never waited that long at a sushi place. I was surprised to see that for AYCE, you only get 90 minutes limit. LOL are you kidding me. Half the time is spent waiting for food. Anyways, appetizers were good but sushi was ok. Some of my favorites were:

-Poke Roll
-Garlic chicken (must try)
-Salad (pieces of tuna and salmon in it. It was delicious!)
-Joe's special

I felt like some of the sushi weren't that fresh. Having raised in Japan, I've had some good sushi and know what fresh sushi taste like-this wasn't it.

"Well, I should have known. At two points I tried to leave. i went in for a full highlight and cut on Thursday, and for what was supposed to be gloss but ended up as toner. I didn't know how to express what I wanted for color (I wanted darker and richer - we decided on warm base and ash blond), which was a mistake. The instructor guided the student, and we came to an understanding. This was my fault. 

The reason for the low rating was that the process took 4.5 hours, and the foils took 2+ hours to apply. Pieces broke off. The hair that the student (advanced) described as ""silky"" before the process is now fried. The student said the color shuts off. Bleach (I asked for NOT bleach - she said all lighteners were the same) bleach does not shut off. I went to another salon today for a conditioner to repair the damage. Pieces broke off in their hands - I now have chemically induced bangs where I had no bangs. The Aveda instructor only came by twice - once in the beginning and once at the end. The whole process has killed my hair. The cut was a straight-on blunt cut with no hair up, like when we were kids. The salon today fixed that with hair up and nice edges but couldn't resurrect the damage from the 2 hour foil. The reason for the long process was for exactness of placement. But the damage wasn't worth decent striping (and why I gave two stars, considering it was a school).The hair at the top is dark with white blond and the hair at the bottom is reddish yellow. I blame the school and instructors - they were everywhere but not helping the senior student. There seemed to be only one instructor for many students, and that instructor was resurrecting a cut from another student by doing it herself.

I am just shocked. I used to go to the Aveda Institute in NYC, and the instructors were there all the time, and the cut and color were great. The price in Charlotte was very high, especially for the horror wreaked on my hair. It's just really poor. I would not recommend this salon. Go somewhere - anywhere. For the price and work you can do way, way better.

Note for the Institute: train instructors to visit each student's station at least 3-4 times. Train students to wash the bottom of the hair if the foiling takes too long. (The top is not finished/done while the bottom is.) Teach students not to do a blunt cut along the bottom. Teach students to watch the time and ask for help. And please lower your high prices - they shouldn't be half of normal but one fourth.",2.0

"Joined Yelp just so I could write a review on this place! Absolutely love JUICE CORE! The staff is amazing, so knowledgable and patient. Katie, the redhead is usually the one helping me. I JUST LOVE HER! Every time I go in there she lets me try new juices they've concocted and gives me great juicing and yoga advice. 
The pricing is dead on! It pretty much balances out to the same as if you were juicing at home. 
Keep up the good work guys! I'll always come in when I'm in Arizona. I'm addicted and so is everyone who tries it.",5.0
2nd time there and my baby loves it. Everything is cushioned and safe for kids. I don't need to worry about her picking anything off the floor and eating it. Staff super nice . Definitely a place to visit for some indoor fun for kids. Summer time fun for sure.! I will be back.,5.0
Small simple restaurant. No decor. No greeting. You seat yourself. No expression on the owners. Spring rolls are bleah. Pho rice noodles...More noodles...Where the meat at??? $25 meal didn't really fill us up. We only came here because no one greeted us on the other side at Pho Quinn. Be warned.,1.0
"Been here a few times usually with a small group of friends after work. They have a really large bar area and I love the outdoor patio. The drink selection is decent and they are pretty fairly priced. The food is a bit pricey, servings are small, and it is just not that eventful-have had wings, potatoes, and pizza. There are many things to keep you occupied from multiple TV screens, trivia, etc. My biggest issue is although the servers are all friendly service can be painfully slow. I would definitely not recommend this if you were looking for an easy in easy out lunch.",3.0

"Go someplace else! This place was super slow, we never got refills, they move at a snails pace and they weren't even busy! I got a dried up hamburger on a crunchy bun that swallowed the meat. There was no flavor or any condiments! The fries were super greasy and tasted frozen. We also got the club sandwich which looked better, but it also lacked flavor. We had to ask for ranch 3 times for our appetizer before someone brought it to us. The first waitress looked at us like she was annoyed when we asked for some. She said, ""ya"" and walked back to the bar area and started chatting. We asked our waitress twice before she finally brought it after our entrees had arrived. The entire time we were there the manager kept apologizing to the table behind us about the cooks. He said their pasta was going to come out late because they never prepped it. He originally told them 20 minutes and he came back later and said it would take even longer. I think this place would only be good if you were drunk or thought Peter Pipers Pizza was gourmet!",1.0
"Oh Table 274 - I'm so happy you're in Cotswold! 

With a focus on hard work, locally sourced ingredients, supporting local farmers and frankly, making really really delicious food, Table 274 is well on their way. The restaurant is nestled in the back of Cotswold shopping center (behind the toy store) and boasts an expansive space with plenty of tables and large bar area. I've also seen the bar menu - it looks pretty delicious.

On to the food...I've been here twice now and here's what I've enjoyed....

Italian sausage & sweet potato gnocchi (lunch item): 4.5/5: A really generous portion of practically perfect gnocchi. They make their gnocchi daily (no small feat) and this dish highlights them beautifully. It very sausage-y, so for those who dig a myriad of meat with delicious pasta, get this - you won't be disappointed. 

Strawberry shortcake: 5/5: Light, fresh and damn delicious. They have a fab pastry chef on board and it showwwwws! I shared the dessert with a friend but I could have easily taken it down myself. 

Fresh made rolls & honey butter: 4/5: I know it seems odd to comment directly on the bread but it was pretty great. Who doesn't love a fresh baked roll and honey butter? No one? That's right. 

Fig Prosciutto Flatbread: 3/5: Pretty much the only item I didn't love here. While the portion was generous, this flatbread lacked both prosciutto and cheese. It was super figgy and I was looking for more of the ying and yang w/the meat and cheese added to it. However, the peppery arugula on top was a lovely addition. 

Toasted gnocchi (appetizer): 5/5: Nabbed this dish before dinner and, again, the gnocchi was wonderful. My Italian grandma would love it. This dish features warm prosciutto, spring pea & carrot - even the veggies were nicely cooked, leaving a bit of a crunch. I would happily order this for a light dinner. 

I have no doubt that if Table 274 continues on their merry way that they'll earn a 5th star in no time. It's a great addition to Cotswold...get your nom on!",4.0
"We hired Nick's to help us with a local load/unload of a 2 BR apartment. They arrived 5 minutes early and got to work straight away. They did an excellent job packing the truck and making sure everything was protected. Nick was very friendly and professional. 
At the unload location, Nick even backed up the truck into the driveway for me and put together a desk. They made a stressful day much less stressful. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone who needs help with a move!",5.0
"Worst hotel experience ever! It's not about the location, everyone knows it's far from the strip. It's service doesn't match its star at all!

1. Disordered system. We booked online, and they can not find our reservation in their system. So they rebooked one night for us without any notification! If I didn't pay attention to my email, we would have paid twice for the same room!! That's really unacceptable.

2. Bad attitude. Both check-in and check-out took us more than 20min. And they don't want to be responsible for what they have done to us as listed in 1. 

3. No bath tub. It's so wired, but they don't have bath tub in the whole hotel.

4. No maintenance. We spent two nights there and there was no cleaning after the first night for no reason!

5. Stupid sensor. They have things available in the fridge and above the fridge. If you have ever touched them, they may charge you even if you didn't consume them at all. So pay attention to the resort fee when you check out!!

It's sooo disappointing experience, we would never go back again!",1.0

There's enough space that the fumes aren't a problem, and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. It's not fancy, but it's clean, and the tech listened to what I wanted and treated me with the respect I feel like a paying customer deserves, which is getting harder and harder to find in Charlotte.",4.0

"I have always loved five guys but this location really impressed me the other night. We weren't sure what time they closed and knew we would be cutting it close when we went. We got there and opened the door and saw they closed at 10 then we were disappointed and went on to find some place else to eat when someone who worked there, I'm  guessing some kind of manager, came out and told us to come on it and that they were still open. It was so nice and refreshing since most places scoff and give you attitude if you come in anywhere close to closing time. He welcomed us inside with such a great attitude and saved the day since that was what we were really craving. I wish I would've gotten his name so I could give him a shout out.",5.0
"We were on the guestlist so girls got 2 free drink tickets and the guys had to pay $30. The pool isn't too big but its nice cause you can just stand in front of the stage with your feet in the pool without having to be completely in the water. 

Lockers were $40 and the bar that takes the free drink tickets is right by the lockers. You can only get one drink at a time though :\ There's also another shaded bar towards the back near the restrooms. Overall had a great time and can't wait to go back!!",4.0
"The food is great in my opinion and they have pretty good deals. Today I had the famous bowl (Only Wednesdays) for only $2.99. That's a really good deal because the portions are generous and satisfying. I'm not too sure why this place is rated so low. It's not bad at all. The cashier, Francis, was extremely kind. I liked her a lot. Nice cashiers are what I really observe to be honest. 

Oh! One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't any sauce packets out. Maybe because it was still early, but I would have appreciated if they were out. Haha. Other than that, KFC is bomb diggity. I will be back!",3.0

Everything was so delicious, staff was courteous and helpful. We started with vegetables pakodas (pakora). Then we had Mango Masala, Palak Paneer, and Baingain Bharta; which were all amazing.

"I'd decided this morning I'd walked by this place one time too many. 

The exterior, truly diner-like, exposes some of the quirky vintage records propped up against the windows, which reminds me of the long gone (from west Durham anyways) Melanie Pringles. 

It seems I walked in just as they opened and was greeted by the wonderful waitress in sunglasses. I resisted the temptation to sit at the counter and thus avoided my cliché movie moment. But I digress, 
All-Day Breakfast is where it's at. True, it's hard to mess with, but when it's good, it's good. Real potatoes for homefries, eggs nicely over-medium, sausage, rye, fruit & a good coffee. 

If anything, the mismatched vinyl chairs & tables and the regulars that were just settling in for their morning coffee was enough to bring me back.",4.0

"The Sochu House has an interesting aesthetic style with seemingly random vintage-modern furnishings and splashes of color. The dining room has relatively few tables, is a bit dark, and a little loud from the music. Yet, the chairs are extremely comfortable. 

The food is a unique and creative Asian fusion. The mint pepper chicken dinner plate was amazing. It bursted with flavor from healthy white meat chicken pieces (fried with light skin, no breading), water chestnut, and sweet juicy pineapple chunks. The sauce contained a great blend of spices and was good enough to eat itself. For tapas, the wasabi soy chicken was fresh, nicely grilled, and had a thin layer of teriyaki. It came with the most stunning fresh wasabi and wasabi-soy sauce I have ever had. The quail tapas was very small, but had a good Chinese duck style flavor. However, the green tea cheesecake dessert was a bit disappointing, since it basically tasted like a regular cheesecake. 

Sochu House is located in a bit of an odd location on a high-traffic route, which is a deterrent to going back. While I like the size of the meal portions, since they are small, the value ratio is not on par with other great places in town. Often, I leave other locations with one or two extra meals for the same price and food quality. This is the kind of place that I might bring an out of town guest to, since it is trendy and has creative dishes.",3.0

I asked some friends, and HomeJoy came highly recommended.  If only I had known that there was someone out there like Michelle before -- I wouldn't have hesitated.

She is thorough, professional, friendly and let's pray non-judgmental. :)  Within a few hours in her capable hands, I could finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.  My mess was transformed into something straight out of a model home and I could not be prouder... proud that I had the insight to hire HomeJoy and Michelle to help.  

They are affordable and accommodating.  Quick and helpful.  I would highly recommend them to everyone/anyone that needs a magical dusting fairy to lend a hand from time to time, or as I have come to terms with -- on a regular basis.

"I happened to visit the Maharaja on a weekday. The ambience here is great. The three Mahals i.e Sheesh, Rang and Hawa depict Indian culture and traditions. The menu is well divided into 4 sections Awadh, Hyderabadi, punjabi and the Rajputana. The hostess started with a tour of the restaurant and that's great. They treat their customers like the Maharaja. My Server Aman was great, he suggested some great appetisers . The Haryali murg ke parche and the Shahjani Badal Jaam were excellent. For mains we had the Sikandri Raan and dum ki murg Asaf ja, with some garlic naans. Their  deserts are all made in house, my fav was the Kesar Ras Malai.

"This company and it's owner, [redacted] is a joke. Actually, it's worse than a joke because he is actively defrauding many Canadians of their money, and harming peoples credit scores by claiming that you can pay them and have peace of mind while in fact they are doing absolutely nothing while your ticket goes into default. This has happened to for both of the tickets I sent their way. Oh man, had I known what kind of a guy [redacted] was, I would have stayed far away. I tried calling him, and all he did was rudely tell me to email them and he would reimburse me. I emailed them, twice, and of course I was ignored. Just look at his replies to people below! He's literally threatening to sue people for leaving bad reviews, and he has the balls to ask people to take down their negative reviews because he refunds them ONLY AFTER HE GETS CAUGHT BY THE MEDIA. Obviously he's very selective about which tickets he actually handles, probably less than half of those he receives and is paid for.

Anyways, if you're in the same boat as the majority of people scammed by this guy, do what John suggested below and issue a chargeback on your credit card. Then, if you have the time, file a complaint with these organizations against [redacted]. Hopefully with enough attention we can get [redacted] barred from ever scamming anyone ever again.

I waited for my appointment 45 minutes even though he was not seeing patients at the time since there was no one else there.

"It's everything you can imagine for a Chinese restaurant.  The elegant dramatic decor, the busy staff doing MARATHONS and most of the restaurant blocked off for a 50th anniversary banquet celebration but no dance floor available which can be a good thing for the 2 left footers.

Food is A-OK priced and tasty, however the complimentary SOUP is pretty much salted water.  Portions did disappoint a little but then who asked us to come to a traditional Chinese restaurant in Market Village?

We got something that resembled a Sweet&Sour Shrimp Balls which was something I enjoyed with an interesting TEXTURE that is similar to the Fake-Lobster Balls sold at Chinese grocery markets except it is make with whole shrimps rolled into a ball shape.

The Crispy Fried Chicken has a nice thin crisp skin and flavoured as good as I've had anywhere else.  The whole plate was scattered full of Shrimp CHIPS more than usual which my believe is to do two purposes, to hide the lack of Chicken and to add to the plating appeal.

We had a vegetable dish that had Bok Choy, Shitake Mushroom and Sea Cucumber and OMG those Sea Cucumber was the size, color and shape of a Rats Penis.  It was FUNNY as one of the managers came by to sell some FRESH Sea Cucumbers to patrons for $20.00 which were actually worth the value while I stare at ours looking like Rat droppings.

"Chase is everything evil,, like most of the big banks (BofA, Citibank) that nearly collapse our economy in '08.  
However, their proposed mortgage rates saved us tens of thousands of dollars over the future of the mortgage, so we signed a deal with the devil.  Now regretting that, should've gone with the non-profit Patelco instead!

The usual sweettalking and oh-so-responsive until you sign with them.... then you can't get ahold of them at all, there's delays & they make mistakes you have to struggle to fix.

The most recent: Sent our check to their AZ office.  Happily cashed our LARGE ""Additional Principal Payment"" check on 3/3 (that we sent in with a form that specifically says this is an ""Add'l Principal Payment"".  March statement comes showing check is cashed but sitting there ""Unapplied"".  Ok, the statement was generated on March 4th,  it's still suspicious that they couldn't cash & apply it on the same day, but I'm sure they did that to keep accruing interest.
Next month, statement comes and the LARGE amount of $ still shows as ""Unapplied"".  So they get to take my money, charge me interest on the loan and do jacksh*t with it?

So I call and get the ubiquitous out of country call center with a guy speaking in a singsong voice who REPEATS EVERYTHING I SAY and prefaces every single freaking sentence with my name (which is soo creepy I dont' know why they train them to do that!)   He now claims that they've applied the payment, supposedly retroactvely but couldn't give a specific date and my loan amount has gone down.  Yeah, i'll believe that when I see it on the next statement.  And were they just going to sit on all that money until I noticed?

"This is the story of The Great Food Truck Clusterfuck.

The Food Truck Festival welcomed us with a hot dirt lot filled with thousands of people standing in zig-zaggy Disney Land-esque lines with maybe 20 - 25 food trucks.  The promotions for this event stated ""over 30"" trucks would be there, but I guess that doesn't matter since you wouldn't be able to try all of them anyhow.  Each line was 50+ people deep and took 20 - 30 minutes of standing in one to get a bite size sample. 

You had to stand in THREE lines to get a beer. One for ID check. One for wristband. One for beer. 

For some reason, children were admitted for free - this created a mess of strollers trying to push through lines and unattended children running around, bumping in to people. 

The Mister and I were here for 2 hours and tried itty bitty samples from four trucks.  I was so disappointed and frustrated in this event that I asked for a refund.  I was presently surprised that that process was very painless, basically no questions asked. The staff and cooks were all very friendly and did a great job, even though they were all in way over their heads. 

I understand that this is their first time putting on this event and they will sure have plenty to learn for the following years. I want to support this, and if I hear about changes being made I will certainly try it again next year.",1.0
"Exploring a new restaurant is always of interest.  The menu at Cafe Deia caught our attention, along with a few other specials they were offering.

Starting off with their White Sangria ($20 pitcher), I found it to be a bit strong and not sweet enough.  I had to ask for some simple syrup so I could enjoy it morel.  Like Amy S. mentioned, they could really use some real fruit in there.  I like my sangria loaded with fruit and it's mostly lemon slices in there.

A pretty large menu to choose from, but we decided to go with tapas all the way.

* Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese ""Thinly sliced imported Serrano ham served with Manchego and a French baguette"" ($9) - Highly recommended by our waiter, Chris.  Warm baguette arrived with a few slices of cheese and salty ham. Yes, it's good and very rustic.  Reminds me of the kind of food you grab for a picnic when you're overseas.  They give you more bread if you need it too!

* Tuna Tartar ""Diced ahi tuna mixed in wasabi, soy sauce and Asian chili paste served with avocado and green onions"" ($8) - The avocado and tomatoes are served in a crispy shell with the tuna mixture and hard-boiled egg bits on the side.  Good, but needs some assembling if you want to get all the tastes in your mouth at once.

* Shrimp Ceviche ""Tiger shrimp cooked in lime and lemon juice, mixed with avocado, cucumber, red onions and chili pepper"" ($9) - Generous on the shrimp and tasty!  It was good on its own and presented in a nice manner too.

* Bacon Wrapped Figs ""Fresh figs wrapped in bacon and pan seared"" ($7) - My absoluter favorite dish of the evening.  A total flavor explosion in your mouth!  The balsamic vinegar sauce adds a nice acidity and sweetness, and is just delicious!  

* Stuffed Mushrooms ""Stuffed Chorizo mushrooms, and baked to perfection."" ($4) - Yummy little buggers as well, along with the balsamic vinegar sauce drizzled on the bottom.  Good stuff! 

* Black Mediterranean Mussels in Garlic White Wine Sauce ""Sauteed in garlic and white wine"" ($9) - Came with bread which is needed to sop up all that wine and garlic sauce laying beneath the mussels.  Yum.

* Mallorcan Soup ""the only soup you can eat with a fork! pork, vegetables and bread slowly cooked in olive oil and natural juices"" ($5) - It's 'interesting' if anything.  More stew-like, and not one of my favorites although the Husband enjoyed it.

Dessert menus are delivered in a letter.

* Fruit Beignet $3 - Pretty disappointing.  Nothing to rave about.  The batter had hints of all the other savory foods that it was fried with.

* Chocolate Banana Crepe ($5) - Highly recommended by our waiter, especially since I wasn't impressed with the beignet.  The crepes were okay, a bit too thick for my liking.  Reminded me of pancakes, which I'm more of a waffle kind of girl.  Simple crepes, folded over, then slices of banana, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar go on top.  

I think the Spanish Creme Brulee ($7) or Chocolate Lave Cake ($7) would have fared better.

We did try ordering:

* Sausage Platter ""Assorted imported Spanish sausages served with a French baguette"" ($8) - Our waiter wasn't too fond of this and pushed the Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese dish on us instead.

* Albondigas ""Ground beef meatballs served in a spicy tomato sauce"" ($5) - Again, we wanted to order this, but was discouraged to do so.  Just as well from reading all the other reviews about this dish.

Overall, service was good.  Chris was attentive as well as the other staff that helped along.  The food came out a bit too fast for the two of us, so we had to make room quickly at our table.  The chef came by at one point to check on our meal, which I definitely appreciated that personal touch.  (The Husband also noticed the chef helping out with front room duties too.)  We also saw salads made table side, which is totally unnecessary but a nice presentational effect.

They have a lot of promise.  An outdoor eating area with firepit and happy hour specials can definitely pull in the crowds.  We went during their Mardi Gras specials.  The tapas we ordered are perfect for two to three sharing, maybe even four.  They also serve up salads, paellas, burgers, and pizza if you want something more for just yourself too.

"Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.

Pizza A Metro is tha BOMB!!.... to start with this is in a bad area(block). It's hiding in a tiny strip mall with a Circle K in it. This is a bit pricey considering where it's located but not over priced for the food quality. This has a very small piece of Italy inside the doors and great customer service. I ordered the vodka penne and it was GREAT!! I love beacon... (who doesn't??) and cheese!! My guest ordered veal cav???otti... something like that... and it was also awesome. Bread kept coming and our drinks stayed full. I left thinking it was really great food and a very pleasant experience. I did see a HUGE pizza being made while I was eating and next time I really want to try one of those. (Would be awesome for a bear get together)!! I will be eating here again and look forward to that HUGE pizza. The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 star was due to location. I have to admit though that I do love to find these out of the way places with superb  food and surprise people from out of town. To see the look on their faces..... (PRICELESS)!!!,4.0
"Most authentic Hawaiian food in town, best tasting Hawaiian food in town, and the lowest price Hawaiian food in town! Now that's a triple WIN-WIN-WIN!

I've literally eaten every menu item they have, and it has all been very good. The food they make is the closest to the food I grew up eating in Hawaii, and that's probably because the owners actually moved here from Hawaii to open this restaurant!

The portions are quite large, and the prices are lower than any other ""Hawaiian"" restaurants in town. I had to use quotes because most of those restaurants that call themselves ""Hawaiian"" are places like L&L which are more like what Taco Bell is to Mexican food.

The service is always great, and the ingredients they use always taste fresh, never old.

I'd recommend this place to everyone AND their moms! In fact, I already have multiple times!",5.0
I love Ross j's and their prices! They make awesome local Hawaii food! This definitely brings me back home to Hawaii but I recently tried out their roast pork and its absolutely not what I had expected. I was very disappointed when I opened my plate because back home in Hawaii many people know roast pork as the crispy fried pork bites with crispy skin and usually eaten with hot mustard and soy sauce. But this roast pork looked and tasted as if it was boiled and then slathered with gravy. It tasted like a TV dinner and wasn't appetizing at all. I love Ross j's and everything else that I have tried but one star off because of the horrible roast pork.  It was not a pleasant lunch.,4.0
"I've been here a few times, usually early in the morning to get breakfast before I head into work. This place shuts down at 7am so I get here early enough.

What drew my attention to this place was that they Portuguese sausage eggs and rice, very popular combo for a local Hawaiian from the islands.

The staff is friendly and the portions are more than enough! I've actually heard customers in the nearby seating area mention the same thing.

From biscuits and gravy, corned beef and hash, French toast, country style potatoes with red and green peppers, there's something here for everyone.

I stick with what I like the best from this place and that is the Portuguese sausage and eggs.

The above mentioned are from the food line, there is an overhead menu if you'd like to order a la cart.

This also another place to get some really good oxtail soup!

I mentioned this place closes for breakfast at 7am, then it re-opens and turns into a Chinese food place.

I've not had their Chinese food but I wanted to give it a mention.

I have given this place only 4 stars because I've tried the other breakfast offerings and I honestly didn't enjoy it. I believe it's because much of the food had been sitting in the heated food line and loses its flavor appeal. 

But, If you're creeping back to hotel in the wee hours of the morning on Fremont, you know you can stop by this casino and grab you some breakfast.

"I've been to Bonefish six times because my boyfriend likes it. I think it's just okay. I'm not impressed with the service or the food. Yesterday I ordered an appetizer before dinner and while I was still eating the server came over to take our dinner order. I thought it would have been good manners had she waited until we were done with the appetizer instead of coming over when we have food on our forks and are actively trying to enjoy our appetizer. I felt like we were being rushed.  I ordered cocktails so i was dying for water but unfortunately I wasn't given water..  Ive tried the bacon wrapped scallops, mahi mahi, Chilean sea bass, firecracker tacos, lobster bisque, chowder, key lime pie. Nothing stood out as really good and I've ordered a different item each time to try to find something I liked but it's all just okay.",3.0

"A very large disappointment overall, close to the worst dining experience I've ever had  The dinner started with the suggestion of doing the chefs choice sampler family style since we were a group of 11 and then he proceeded to leave without taking a drink order. Can I have at least the promise of a drink while I consider my meal?

When the waiter returned 10 minutes later we made our choice of following his suggestion and finally took our drink orders. The problem with family style is that we were being served our 2nd plate of food before the drinks came. 

The first plate was a tuna sashimi and tuna tartar. An excellent first plate, I don't enjoy fish but I seem like good sashimi and this was very good sashimi. I was really looking forward to the remainder of the meal. It is kinda cool when you don't know what coming next. 

What came next my martini and their slaw in unison. I have to agree with an earlier review and say the slaw was a little too sweet which played against a little too much cilantro and did not work for me. The martini was ok but my twist left a lot to be desired, looked like t had been done with a machete.  My girlfriend had their manhattan special which was nice but not $18 a piece nice. 

3rd course was The beef carpaccio a real disappointment. The flavour wasn't there and had nothing to offer. One of the people in our party had mentioned they didn't enjoy raw food and this was the second raw course in 3 dishes. Thanks for listening, oh wait you can't hear anything in the restaurant cause it's just too loud. 

Scallops were next I didn't try the scallop but I did steal the bacon and was way overdone and too salted. My girlfriend says the scallop was quite good  After that was black cod with miso. The smell didn't work for me so I didn't try but the girlfriend says it was cooked very well.

Crab cakes were next and while good there was only 4 cakes served for 11 people. Next up was lamb and potatoes, now we're talking! I love lamb and this had no taste to it in the least. It was a shame because it was cooked perfectly. At this point there was only desert left and I was still starving. 

Desert was good but not great. The ice cream and molten chocolate cake was great, the pear tart and other stuff is average at best. 

While some food was great. I came away feeling that not enough food was served for the amount of money paid, the atmosphere sucked and the wait staff a little poncey and yelley. Felt a little scammed on the food and the drink prices.",1.0

"I've been a fan of Mon Ami Gabi since I lived in Reston.  Good food, good service, good prices.  On this visit, the bartenders were really great!  My only nitpick here is they have a separate line for the outdoor seating, which has a view of the Bellagio water show.  I asked how long, the hostess said an hour and 15 minutes.  I casually laid a folded jackson on her lectern and asked if we couldn't shorten that by any, and without batting an eyelash she repeated ""An hour and fifteen"" like I'd laid a $1 on her!  Come on, this is Vegas! :-D  I have no idea if a $50 would have done the trick or if they're just immune to lubrication there for some reason.  But that isn't the reason for the 4 stars, that just happens.  I asked the inside hostess for a table with a view, and we had to wait a few more minutes, but that's what bars are for!  I think maybe I'm unfairly comparing Mon Ami against higher-ticket restaurants instead of favorably against lower-end places.  In any case, you won't be disappointed!",4.0
"I wanted to indulge with and Eggs Benedict on our trip and chose this restaurant because of the location and reviews. It was not my favorite benedict due to the hollandaise sauce having too much lemon for my taste.

"I wish it was my anniversary everyday. 

My boyfriend and I visited Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate our two year anniversary. His sister-in-law used to continually rave about this place and after months of waiting, we decided that our anniversary would the perfect date. 

I don't know why but for some reason, we decided not to make reservations. Foolish, foolish idea. You most definitely should make a reservation. We waited for about 40 minutes and finally got seated in a table made for two. Seeing that my boyfriend is a 6'2"", 200lb man, let's just say that the table was just a bit on the tiny side.

We were greeted by a curly haired waitress-- she was terrific! She first started us off with some bread and butter to accompany my glass of Merlot and my boyfriend's glass of Cotes du Rhone. I know that he enjoyed his wine but it definitely didn't compare to the most smooth and soft bodied Merlot I have ever tasted. Mmmm, soooo good!

We went on to order the warm brie cheese as our appetizer. Oh this is so very, very good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but I decided to order this for my cheese-loving man. Good thing because I couldn't stop my hands from reaching for the platter! The croutons gave such a nice crunch and the slightest bit of saltiness to contrast the soft and gooey, sweet honey-covered cheese. I swear I think this is the only appetizer we'll ever order here!

For the main, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon au poivre and I ordered the filet mignon merlot. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection, juicy and well seasoned. However, we both agreed that t the end of the day, mine was much more flavorful due to the merlot reduction. Either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and it went well with our steak, although it had too much black pepper for our taste.

With the help of many hours of Masterchef Australia, I became familiar with different types of french desserts and was extremely excited to order profiteroles... until I saw the chocolate fudge cake with homemade caramel ice cream, that is. We ended up ordering the chocolate cake which was beyond incredible. Then, our kick ass waitress sensed much hesitation from me and brought out some profiteroles--on the house! Score! :D Needless to say, it was phenomenal. 

Obviously, my overall experience was absolutely superb, and I definitely recommend this place for people who are celebrating a wonderful occasion. Just brace yourself- you're gonna want some more real soon!",5.0
"This was one delicious restaurant in Vegas!

We sat in the restaurant while we waited to watch the Bellagio Water Show #2 across the street from it. There was also a patio to enjoy the busy streets of passer-byers but we chose to sat in the restaurant as it was a tad chilly. The atmosphere was very romantic indeed...no doubt about that.

- Steak Béarnaise (a rich buttery sauce, aromatic sauce featuring shallots, tarragon and crushed black peppercorns)
- Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onions, red wine sauce); this was original compared to the Bearnaise.

Both steaks were thin but juicy and tender. The steaks also came with the signature hand-cut frites...yum. 

I'm glad I got the chance to try this place out - 5 out of 5!",5.0
"I loved the restaurant. I came in and it was gorgeous. I asked for a seat on the enclosed patio. I was reminded of a greenhouse. I was served a whole baguette with butter, which I tasted but couldn't eat all by myself.

I ordered an open-faced crab salad sandwich. The toast wasn't too great, but the crab salad was delicious. They had some sort of sauce on the side too that was great with the bread and with the little waffle potato chip side.

It was $14.95 for lunch. Not bad for providing me with a Paris ambiance. As I dined, I felt like I was in France. Never been but that's how I imagine it.",4.0

"Our first visit to this quaint little place was in December during the Holiday shopping madness on our way home from the Galleria. 1st,the Service was great. The owner came by to welcome us- very nice! 
They gave us garlic bread sticks, they were ok - possible they were not homemade?? 
We ordered a coke $4- ouch!
Linguini Carbonara $21 
Chicken Parmesan $24 
Honestly, the food was so hot, we had to let it cool down before we could eat. I had a few bites but burned my tongue and couldn't eat any more. We took it to go. 
The chicken reheated well,  a bit too much garlic but that's OK. 
The carbonara had way too much oil/butter & i didn't really enjoy it. 
I think we will try it one more time. There were some enticing dishes listed on the menu... 
Won't be bringing the kids with these prices though.
I hope they do well, it's a nice place.

"Las Vegas is a town that is known for it's buffets, and I'm sorry to say that just about any of them would be a better choice than the Paradise Garden Dinner Buffet. 

Located in the flamingo, the buffet offers most of the standard buffet fare - Crab Legs, Sushi, Prime Rib, Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, etc. It's just that none of these selections are very good.

On 2nd thought, the Crab legs were pretty tasty - unfortunately I spent 20 minutes trying to crack open the meat since they didn't offer shell crackers. 

Someone below commented that the food selections were often mis-labeled, and in some cases not labeled at all. This was a pet peeve of mine as well. It's actually sad how many times I had to examine something more closely, only to walk away empty handed because I wasn't exactly sure what it was!

The servers were friendly, but the attitudes of the chefs seemed disgruntled, as if my request to cut a slice of meat was an inconvenience. The whole experience was underwhelming, which would have been understandable if this were a $7.95 buffet at the Palace Station. But for $20/person in a strip casino, I expect a little bit better. 

My advice, spend the extra $10 person and go to the Wynn/Bellagio/Mandalay or any of the other awesome buffets located in the vicinity.",2.0
"Compared with Duckworth's in Ballantyne, this place was a bit of a disappointment last time. While service in Ballantyne is ridiculously friendly and helpful, the waitress at this branch was fine but not very accomodating to special requests. We asked to get nachos without sour cream and with a little more salsa instead. Out came nachos WITH sour cream and an extra ketchup-container of salsa for which we were charged 1.50 dollar. 

Their draft beer list also seems to have shrunk quite a bit and is now much shorter than at the Ballantyne location. Not sure if this is temporary of not.",3.0

For our entrees, we ordered the bowtie Olivia and the special which was a 22 ounce bone in ribeye with potatoes, asparagus and carrots. The pasta didn't have as much flavor as I would of liked but I added some crushed red peppers. The ribeye I did not try but he said it was fabulous, lots of great flavor!!

"I'm one of the few who still loves the feeling of holding and reading an actual book vs an ebook, but I'm also trying minimize clutter in my house. So the library is perfect! They have a large selection of books even new releases. If you're on top of things you can put yourself on a waitlist for the newest releases in books and movies. I started getting more reaquaitned with library when I had my son. I wanted to get out of the house and do something but found that every time I left my home I spent money. I wanted to be able to leave my house and not feel pressured to spend money. So one day I stopped by the Century library. I had forgotten how many resources they have. I was able to get books for my son, a book for me, and a movie to watch with my husband later. 

I also found out they had free baby and kid programs so I started taking my son to those as well. I loved it! Ms. Tracy is typically the librarian who leads the programs at Century which include, story time, songs, games and child playtime. Ms. Tracy is excellent! She's very patient with the kids and offers lots of ideas for home play. These programs are also great ways to meet other parents. They have weekday and weekend programs.

The library also offers culture passes. These are passes you can check out to visit local museums such as The Science Center, the zoo, the art museum, and the children's museum. Each library only has a limited selection per day so get there early if you want to check one out. 

The library isn't just for those who love paper books as they offer ebooks you can check out as well. They even have Nooks you can check out. 

The Century Library may be one of my favorite places to go and kill time. I highly recommend checking it out and utilizing all the amazing resources they have.",5.0

"We chose Hash house for our easter brunch since it was close to the church we were attending. It was a really disappointing experience of gigantic portions of mediocre food. 

We ordered the lamb chop hash (medium rare) off the easter menu. It wasn't a hash at all, just two very rare chops on top of potatoes. A hash is diced up meat cooked WITH potatoes, not just put on top. I like rare meat, but the chops were very rare, I should have sent them back. 
The biscuit it came with was very dense and dry. 

My mom ordered the fried chicken benedict. You couldn't even tell it was a benedict, it was just a mountain of food piled together. It didn't even look appetizing. Lastly was the cobb salad which wasn't bad, but not great either.

I've had the tacos, red & green chili burrito. After I had the chili burritos this is the only thing I get from this place. To my taste buds, these are the best chili burritos I've had. 
The chili is generous (always hot and smooth). The meat is good portion, not too much not too little. The tortilla is amazing. Only burrito sauce I don't let go to waste.

Interior & Exterior
It's not appealing to the eyes but you can tell they keep it clean and organized. It's just not nice interior or exterior. It's not a place you would want to eat at so just get to go. The interior is clean though, and the food is great.

Very clean. 

Price

The staff at this location is rather large (close to a dozen associates) which is somewhat rare for employment agencies (3-5 people is the norm) but keep in mind they are the second largest staffing agency in the world and have a big book of clients (the Phoenix office as well) ranging from financial institutions to government agencies and just about everything in between.  I had a placement through Randstad in Phoenix and it was a good job that matched my skills and experience very closely.  The pay was fair and in the midst of the current bad economy, just knowing I had a job, even a long term temporary one was compensation in itself.  I was also offered other positions with good rates of pay as well and for that I'm grateful.  As with any employment agency, I recommend visiting their website first just to get a feel for what their policies and procedures are as well as size, areas of specialty and company news.  Overall I would highly recommend Randstad for help finding employment whether it be temporary or permanent.  Best of luck!",5.0
"The majority of the reviews on this place are accurate.  Its overrpiced and stuffy.  
The atmosphere is nice if they didnt over crowd.  If you are a attractive male who looks like he has money they you will get alot of attention by the bottle service borderline ""escort"" like server girls.... who will basically ignore you if you are female.  
Honestly.. dont bother.. there are far better places to go with friendly staff and not as stuffy!",2.0

"Booked the appointment with Dr. Oriaku as a new patient; however, I was seen only by his PA. I specifically booked with Dr. Oriaku due to availability and wanting to see a physician. Never having visited his office and 45 minutes after my scheduled appointment, I was aghast that ""due to a slow day"" he opted to do office work and was no longer seeing patients (although still in the office). When the disheveled PA had talked with me, I asked if I was going to see him next she said she could ask, but when I asked for my copay back she immediately raised get voice and was hostile when I was calm. When I asked for an email address of the physician or office manager, they remarked that they could not give that out. Working in healthcare myself, we never have issues giving out contact information for anyone at any level of the organization as we care for or patients and promote transparency and all types of direct communication. I'm not interested in being a patient in an office that prefers to be deceptive and change providers, gets frustrated when you ask why, and then puts barriers in the way of direct communication.",1.0
"These guys are great! 
I sent in a request for a new water heater. 
Tom called me back within the hour, gave me a firm quote over the phone (very fair price), and said he would try to get an installer to my house that same day (this was already after 2pm so I was not really expecting same day service). 
About 30 minutes later, I got a call they would be at my house in 30 minutes.
Angel was the installer, he was very courteous, professional, and prompt. 
Very satisfied with the entire process, pricing was fair, service was great, they were quick, could not have asked for anything more. Would 100% recommend this company.
Thank you!",5.0
"So happy to have a restaurant so close by that's actually worth going to. It's also great that's local & not a chain. The food is good, but when you order it keep in mind that they use an American level of seasoning. If you don't like bland food then you'll want to up your number. 4 is still kind of bland so you may want a 5. I don't like spicy food, but I don't like bland food either. Everyone is very pleasant that works there.",3.0
Finally a place to fulfill my korean bbq and Sushi cravings in one place!  You can actually order AYCE sushi while you're eating AYCE BBQ at your grilling table! They also have soju and Korean style rice wine to make your meal even tastier! They also make authentic korean side dishes with the freshest ingredients they shop for that week. Everyone is super nice and the service is fast. Ryan the owner is amazing and can walk you through menu if you have any questions.,5.0
"I used to come to this restaurant about two years ago. I loved them! Fresh food, friendly service, excellent coffee.

I went there today and was not impressed. We waited about five minutes for a table, which we were fine with. They cleaned it quickly and we sat down. However, I noticed ants crawling on the corner of my table. They were babies, so this isn't a serious problem in the restaurant, yet. I couldn't get the attention of the waiter to get the table cleaned, so I killed then with a sugar packet and let it be. 

We ordered coffee, which came quickly. Our cups were dirty, with clear stains on the sides. We waited about ten minutes for refills, which I find is normal. 

We placed our order. The food came quickly, and was okay. I came with my sister and my friend. 

My friend chose to create his own meal, which came on separate plates. 

My sisters eggs were over cooked. 

My food was okay. It was not very presentable, but was delicious. 

All in all, it was an okay experience, but I've had better at other restaurants. If I had the choice, I would go to any of the over breakfast places on St. Clair.",2.0

This is the best place to get emails read and answered while my kiddos play!",5.0
"This place is fancy as hell! It feels like a big upgrade from the now defunct Farelli's and FilmBar since those were my previous experiences with food and film before this.
I love the arranged seating. 
I love the fact that I can see new releases of major films here. If you go at the right time (during the day) and look at seating beforehand, you can get a theater all to yourself which is really nice. Drinking and talking through a movie in a public place is fun when there are no taboos. 
The only real downside is that it's fairly expensive for what you're getting. The food isn't anything amazing, but maybe it's more expensive because we're already watching a movie which we paid more than we'd normally pay to see? Hmm. Free popcorn is hardly free if you're already paying a lot to get in. 
I'd go again, but I try to ask for gift cards here rather than pay my way, honestly.",4.0
"Wow... I've heard great stuff about this place and have been dying to give it a try. Well, I stopped by the drive-tru for my first time today and got the standard Culver's double cheeseburger meal.

I was soooo disappointed! The fires were just like grocery store frozen fries and the burger is without a doubt the greasiest one I've ever eaten by a long shot! I can't believe it is so busy with Wendy's and Carl's Jr. right across the street. Stick with Carl's Jr. for sure.",2.0
"Its Tuesday, day after a holiday and we are just slammed at work, so some coworkers and I thought ahead and picked a place or order lunch from and pick it up and bring it back to the office .

Today the vote was for Oregano's, I personally had not tried them up until now, but I always see that the place is pack! 

I looked at the menu we had floating around here at the office and I saw they have Midday Rush Menu items from 11am to 3pm Mon to Friday, and I have to say they have a nice variety to pick from. 

I went with the Bollo Pasta; it was a bowl of pasta, crazy right??  It was angel hair pasta cooked perfectly paried with a spicy marinara sauce, and it came with a slice of garlic bread.  It was a perfectly delish lunch, guess I now have Oregano's to add to my lunch time list!",4.0
"I'm typically an enemy of this type of chain but I'll give this one a pass. It's really simple to order and clean inside. Both big positives in the world of fast food.

This is how it works:

You order the meat - either steak, light or dark chicken, or a combination of the two. The meat's served on a layer of brown or white choice, again, your choice. Last two things are the veggies and sauce. I picked carrots and sweet/sour but they had a few good options for each. About 6-7 bucks and you're out the door. They have a few tables setup if you choose to dine inside.",4.0
"I used to like this place but after today I will never return.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger and it was straight up nasty.  I know I'm a picky eater so I try to get things that are hard to mess up.  This thing was an epic fail.  The entire bottom of the plate was wet making the fries and the bottom of the bun ruined.  It didn't matter the fries tasted strange and the bun although burnt from the grill on one side looked like it hadn't been baked long enough.  The chicken itself was dry as a bone and burnt as well.  When I think chicken burger I think a piece of breast meat, but I don't know what this was.  It was more like a clump of chicken sawed in half with a huge chunk of gristle down the middle of it.  Just yuck.  I think the worst part though was the cashier, when she asked how it was I told her, ""Well the service was good.""  She kind of just shrugged and said nothing like she knows the food sucks.  So I ended up paying almost twenty bucks for this plate of shit and I had to stop and grab something quick to eat because this meal ended up in the garbage were it belonged.",1.0

"My Wife and I checked this place out Sunday!  ""Not Just Coffee"" the Coffee Shop was the ONLY Part Open for Business!  Not Just Coffee is the BEST part of this ""market"".  This Place has potential, to be a lookalota, though I think that is all!  This place is still a Disappointment, Not what we were expecting!  ""Not Just Coffee"", the Pizza Place (Pure Pizza) and the Bakery (Cloud Nine) are the only places we would be returning to see, maybe... ""Old World Olive Oil"" does have a small kioskiosk... Meat Market in the back has the HUGEst LIVE Lobsters I have seen in person (I'm the person, Lobsters are not people [PETA may disagree])...   

The Outside (Rail Patio) is much more exciting than inside!  Much more exciting to watch the people on a beautiful weather day (100% this time)!

I'm NOT going to review the 10 Story Parking Garage (you can, others have) even though it is 5 stars GREAT... Maybe I should review it since they suck so much less (now with all the security cameras)...

"I just moved to Pittsburgh a couple of weeks ago from Philadelphia and I knew I had some alignment/steering issues I needed fixed. I had gotten a quote for about $1300 at local Firestone in Philly to get it fixed, but decided to wait until I got to Pittsburgh. After the guys at Calfo's inspected my car, they said a lot of the quote from Firestone was BS. They got me in the next day and cleared up my steering/alignment issues for $1000 less than Firestone quoted me. I have had no issues since.

I always feel like I'm being taken advantage of when I get my car worked on, but not at all at Calfo's. Real nice guys who explained everything that they were doing. They did great work for a great price in just a day. I will 100% go back to Calfo's if I have problems in the future instead of the large chain shops.",5.0

"The Vandal, one of the many restaurants that opened up in Pittsburgh this summer. I am happy that Pittsburgh's food scene is growing quickly. Each restaurant seems to have their own unique place, increasing the diversity of food choices. The Vandal provides interesting hamburgers and sandwiches. Overall, I thought the food was pretty good, but I wasn't completely blown away.

The service was fantastic. Everyone was sweet and helpful. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.

We got the pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, fries, and hibiscus lemonade.

The pork sandwich was okay. The bread was a little chewy, but the flavors were great. The chicken was good. I liked the sweetness of the slaw, which complimented with the spiced chicken. The chicken itself was flavorful and crispy, although some parts of it were a little dry. Overall, the chicken sandwich was definitely the better of the two and the flavors were fantastic, I can see myself coming back for just that.

My only big issue with the place was the hibiscus lemonade. The ice in the drink had that weird savory flavor you get when you have ice in the freezer for too long. As the ice started to melt, it completely ruined our drink.

For the price, I thought it was pretty reasonable for the sandwiches. However, the side salads are pretty small for $5. While not the best chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh, it is a unique one and I see myself coming back sometimes.",4.0
"OK I love this place!!!

When I get a chance to go.  Everyone is so freaking friendly, you really will make friends here, and so ubber supportive. If you don't laugh at yourself and someone else at least 5 times in an hour boot camp class there's definitely something wrong with you.  

It's conveniently located on the corner of Eastern and Windmill so getting there is not hard. Classes are small and intimate, so you definitely get individual attention.  He also does personal training on an individual basis if that interests you. He also has classes in the morning, the evening and on the weekends.  He let's you work at your own pace to, so it's not like he's a military sergeant screaming at you to do whatever he says.

And the classes are HARD, ubber challenging, and really DO help to change your body! But they are fun!  Yeah you do some of the staple things every class but that's like 10 mins of warm up stuff. From there it changes every class almost, which keeps ADD children like myself occupied.

Tony's great and he's not hard on the eyes ladies.  You can pay either on a monthly basis or on a per class basis [I think he sells them in bundles of 10]. If you have certain injuries he'll work w/ you to do other exercises that will either help strengthen your issue or not aggravate it further.  

He uses a combination of your own body weight, tires, bikes, ropes, medicine balls, and running around the building whatever it takes.

Highly recommend at least giving it a try!!!",5.0

Brought my friend to check out the new taco shop.  I ordered the chili relleno plate which was outstanding.   Refried beans and Spanish rice were nice to see as opposed to whole beans and white rice.  I was told the chili relleno's would be coming off the menu which is disappointing.  They say it takes too much time to make in a fast food environment.. whatever.  I guess I will try something else next time.  My friend ordered the chicken fajita tostada which appeared to be quite a value at $3.25 or whatever.  One tostada filled her up.  We ate our meal on the patio at Thai Elephant so we could order from their bar.  It was a nice environment and the food tasted very good.,5.0

"There are multiple ways to look at this location.

- The store is huge.  I seem to recall them actually enlarging it a few years ago, and frankly, they probably could do with half the space.  The one down the street (at Sharon Amity) is maybe a third of the size and they do fine.  This one has a ton of unused space.  If they do not own it, they are throwing away money.  Or they are charging more to make up for it.

- Because of the extra space, you may pay extra.  For that, we do not always shop here for supplies.  You can find good deals around back to school time, but there are usually quantity limits.  So if you need some bulk paper, you might be better off at Wal-Mart.  Specialty items however?  I prefer Office Depot to Office Max, and there is no Staples that is as convenient to this side of town.

- The staff comes and goes.  Literally.  Over the months and years I have shopped here, very few stay the same.  Understandable.  Even if you see the same person, they will likely be very different from one visit to the next.

- On the good side, the rewards program is cool, and you get points back for shopping that you can use on a future visit.  That is always nice.  They also give points to schools for your purchases, which does not help directly, but is a good thing.",3.0

My boyfriend was uncomfortable because they just walked around like zombies and made no small talk with us. They were on their phones the entire time, when we were finished we watched our empty drinks and plate sit in front of us without asking if we wanted another beer or beverage, until we asked to just cash out.

"Got the Junior suite. Was more like a corner King. The decor was Dark and needed to be updated. there wasn't one switch to turn on the lights. you had to turn on/off each one, one by one.

The bathroom was a joke! too small and the bathtub was like 1 foot deep. If I stay in a hotel, I'd like to be able to soak in the bathtub, not just cover my ankles.

The room service options were nice BUT they are the EXACT same as their restaurant Mizzen. So for those of you grounded here. You end up eating the same thing from room service as you do for your meal at Mizzen!

Was going to go to Toula restaurant. But had friends that went their before us and said they had the same sauce for their 3 pastas. and checked the yelp reviews which were BAD.

The bed was nice. but the walls a bit thin. I could hear the alarm going off in the next room as a quiet annoying beep. 

Parking was crazy expensive as a guest $40/night and for my friends that visited me!

"My husband was referred to Healthy At Home by his GP in November of 2014 because of problems with snoring, and to do a sleep study for Apnea. It was nice that they were able to do the sleep study at home. It turned out that he did have apnea and needed a cpap machine. OK, so he went back to Healthy at Home to get one. It seemed logical.

They set him up with a cpap, and various supplies which would last 1 - 3 months. He understood them to say that it would cost about $850, the supplies were $150, and they would bill him over a 13 month period if we went through AccessOne Medical care.

So, December and January passed, and still no bill from AccessOne. We kept calling Healthy at Home, and they told us that ""sometimes they seem to take a long time."" In February we finally get a bill with no details of charges from AccessOne in the amount of $1220. I figure that Hubby has just misunderstood. I make double the scheduled payment, and realize that Hubby needs supplies, so I call Healthy at Home and ask for a mask - no face pad, no elastic band, no filter, no hose, just a mask. They want $93 plus shipping and handling and insurance won't cover durable goods. WTF? I get online and order ALL of those parts plus cleaning supplies with free shipping from Amazon for $78. That's where I order from.

March comes along and I've made a payment and the bill is up to $1,380. We call Healthy at home and they say, ""Oh, AccessOne didn't take your insurance discount into consideration."" Meanwhile, AccessOne is charging us 10% interest on the balance. And then they proceed to do NOTHING about it.

April comes and we owe the $1,495. WHY? Well, we didn't pay $850 for the CPAP and $150 for the supplies, we spent $905 for $78 worth of supplies, and are paying an additional $155 a month to rent the CPAP machine. Except our insuance says that they should only charge us $105 to rent the machine. And Healthy at Home hasn't bothered to call AccessOne to straighten it out because they've closed our account, which is what they do when you choose to not pay them in full all at once - THEY DON'T HAVE A BILLING OFFICE! So, supposedly some supervisor is now going to go back 9 months and have the overcharge of $50 reversed with AccessOne, but god knows I don't expect that they'll recalculate the interest they charged us.

These people are vultures. $758 for $78 worth of supplies designed to last a month? PLUS $155 a month which should be $105 a month for 13 months ($2,015) for a machine that even they admit that they should only have charged us $1,365 for? Not to mention I could buy the Machine from the supplier or another supplier at Amazon for $400? These people jacked up our price $1,800 and have drug it out so long that we can't get out of it. They're crooks. Stay away from them.",1.0

"We had a Groupon for this place. Included in our meal was all you can eat salad bar, seafood and meats. Also one hour of unlimited bloody mary, sangaria, mimosa or draft beer and a dessert to share. Soon after being seated our drink order was taken, we were invited to the salad bar and our sea food platter was served. 

The salad bar was not huge but plenty to choose from mostly cold salad items not a lot of lettuce as you would expect from a salad bar. Some of the items were mushrooms, kale (both hot), zucchini, green beans, rice, bread, soup, fruit, cheese, curry chicken and greek couscous. I only made one trip to the salad bar to save room for the other offerings. The seafood platter was just ok. The fish was a bit dry. The shrimp was good. 

Soon, the meats started to come along. Pork loin, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken, tri tip, pork sausage, and sirloin. A nice surprise was the grilled pineapple. My favorites were the bacon wrapped chicken, pork loin and sirloin.

Some of the meats of course were better than others unfortunately by the time you realized this they were gone and you had to wait until the next pass with it but none failed please.

"did not blow me away at all... it was very meh... the fusion thing is a little weird for me.  

chow mein in a burrito was weird, especially when the chow mein wasn't even good on its own.  in my opinion it did not add any value to the burrito.  Rice is definitely the better option.  The quac is definitely missing the lime factor.. there is no kick in any of the food.  I would have preferred more lime.

I dont know how long this place will last, especially since this location seems cursed.. whatever opens in this location usually closes down.  although it does seem to be the perfect location in the middle of a intersection with 4 TTC transfer stops..

TIP: thats not cool.. that kind of pressure makes me have a bad feeling about this place.",2.0
"I have been to many chiropractors in the past, but Dr. Brian Grow provided by far the most thorough experience I've had at a Joint thus far. I'm so glad I can drop by almost any time to see him and have my body back in working order...before I destroy it again and the cycle continues! I guess the only perk to being physical everyday is that I get to see Dr. Brian to fix me up. It's the best relief! Thank you to the staff at The Joint on Tatum!",5.0

"Pros:
- By far one of my favorite interior designs. Love the lighting and green plant decor. Great Ambience! 
- Green tea ice cream was very yummy

Cons:
- Watermelon blended drink was ok.. decent but not as good as Lollicup's watermelon smoothie at Town Square Mall
-green tea Hong Kong waffle (egglette) was over cooked. It was overly crunchy and hard. My daughter didn't seem to enjoy separating the semi burnt looking egglettes.
- I'd have to say the #1 thing that disappointed me was the customer service. A very beautiful store with presentable drinks and desserts however the customer service did not do well to reflect that. When I ordered my food at the register, the young lady did not smile and was not very suggestive. Her energy was more robotic. After ordering I went and took a seat at the table for 2. A few short minutes went by and than The young lady places my daughters green tea egglette and ice cream in a Togo plastic container and white plastic bag.. I'm sorry but this upset me. They never asked if I wanted the dessert for sit down or to go. I wanted to enjoy a nice sit down with my daughter and treat her to some yummies but I guess this is how they treat first timers in their store. 

Minus 1 star for just Ok drinks and dessert
Minus 2 more star for not cracking a genuine smile and than serving us desserts in Plastic Togo containers",2.0

"Massage heaven.  This place is awesome. They are super friendly & not to mention you get an AMAZING massage for 30 bucks. (Now they offer stamp cards with a free $30 massage after 10 stamps!)

 This isn't just a foot massage- they start by soaking your feet in hot water & literally rub you from your temples to your toes. You are fully dressed so wear something comfy- I usually wear leggings and a tank top. 

I make an appointment but it is nice to have the option of just walking in. Andy, Susan & David are all equally amazing. I would request one of the three. Enjoy :)",5.0

"Was looking around the neighbourhood for a  place to get a good burger, and was not disappointed. They have burgers that nobody else has in the city. Not just what the can go on the burger but the patties go from lentils, salt cod, beef, duck, kangaroo and camel. Where else can you get that many options?
This place does not have some value meal deal for $5. Time, thought, and ingredients have gone into each burger. Guess what you might have to pay for that. Burger fries and a beer, yes they are licensed, will be about $20+tax. 
They have house made condiments that come out with every burger. Sundries tomato, blackberry chutney, and a salsa verde. We found the salsa verde was the best of them. 
Will be back to try all the interesting burgers.",4.0

"This studio is one of the best, I don't even know where to start. 
Take one look at the array of yoga classes this studio offers, and you know you're in for a yoga experience quite unlike any others, with classes like Hot Detox Flow(typical), to Mandala Flow and Ashtanga Current, which is a more advanced class. 

The skill level is marked with tree-like symbols, 1 being slower paced and 3 being challenging and intense. I'd like to think I'm a beginner to intermediate level yogi, and I took a 2.5 level Hot Detox Flow class which detoxed the hell out of my body...and for the next two days. 

I also loved that the instructor teaching my class had actually been to India and learned yoga there. I'm tired of faux-yogis who've basically paid for their teaching certificate from a  non-licensed Toronto school, and it's usually plainly obvious when they incorrectly explain and over simplify Sanskrit terms. If you can't do it properly, don't even bother (I'm looking at you, Moksha Scarborough). At the end of the Detox class, the instructor pulled out a portable harmonium, sang and played a hymn that was both, relaxing and uplifting. 

The studio offers the free usage of their mats, as well as tea and fruits. They also sell an array of tops by James Perse, some other lifestyle clothing and jewelry. 

Change-rooms, lockers and showers are located in the basement, though they are still immaculate, and the room is pretty cute. 

I think this has got to be the best all-round yoga studio in Toronto.",5.0
"Tried the chicken shawarma. It was decent. Don't think the young man at the counter asked me what sauce I wanted so no sauce at all. Would have been better with cucumber sauce so a little bummed. Very clean dining area. Phone was ringing pretty often with orders around 2:30pm so that's promising for them. Give it a try. I also know they deliver (including breakfast!!!) within 5 miles of Edgewood Towne Centre. 

Update: the owner contacted me directly to let me know he was going to use the feedback to train staff which is great. Also offered another shawarma on him. Very good service on his part. If I'm ever in the area, might take him up on that offer.",3.0
"CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY!
I have been to THK twice and love their beers and some of their food.
My wife and I were there with another couple on July 18th.  We were  seated by an experienced waiter who took our order. He then told us that a new waitress would be taking over. We repeated our order and asked them, up front, to give the two couples separate checks. They said that was not a problem. The other couple suggested that perhaps it would help to keep the orders separate from the start. The waitress said that was not necessary. Now we are not used to going over our bills in detail, but the bill presented to the other couple was so high we were puzzled. Guess what? They billed $100 for less than $50 worth of food/drink. And it took two attempts to get it fixed. 
Worse, I went and mentioned the problem to the manager.  I did not ask for any concession or ""freebies"", but did suggest that he go and speak to the couple who had been overcharged.  I  then observed the manager during the rest of our time at THK. He was either talking/joking with staff or expediting food orders. THK was about 30% full so it was not that he was in a rush.  He  did whiz by our table once to drop off a food item, but said not a word to anyone. 
I might give THK one more try...but I will sit at the bar.",2.0
"Hertz Las Vegas provided me with my worst car rental experience to date. Period.

First, I signed-up for the Gold Club membership before I left (booking and signing-up online), and I was told that I needed to visit the counter for the first rental.  This made sense; no problem.

As we landed in Las Vegas, I received a text notifying me that a Kia minivan would be waiting for me in a particular slip, and I had the option to change it.  Since I had requested a Dodge Grand Caravan, I denied the Kia.  The next car sent to me was in fact the Dodge, and it told me which slip to go to.

When we arrive at the terminal, at about 9:00 PM, I found the Hertz counter and was the third person in line.  There were only two people working the desk (surprising to me in a city the size of Las Vegas), but I figured it should move quickly enough.  Remember, the website said I had to go to the counter for the first time using my new Gold Club membership.

Issue 1:  It took 20 minutes to get to the counter because of the two people in line ahead of me.  That's ridiculous.

When I got to the counter, the woman looked at me like I was stupid and said, ""You're Gold Club, you could have just gotten your car.""  I said, ""No, the website said I needed to appear here at the desk the first time before using it.""  She replied, ""Uh, no?""

Issue 2:  The desk personnel were rude.

I thanked her and went out to find my Dodge Grand Caravan in slip number five, except slip number five held a Chevy Traverse--not even the same type of car.  So, I pulled the wife and four little girls together and we walked back to the office and got in line again.

Issue 3:  The wrong car was in the wrong slip.

When I got up to the counter, I explained what happened, and the desk clerk said, ""Oh, cars get put in the wrong space all the time.""  (Really? First, that's dumb, second, that's unprofessional, and third, you should apologize, not tell me that your poor business practices are common practice.)  I also asked about the car seats.  She rolled her eyes and said, oh, yeah, they're in the back.

Issue 4:  I had booked them in advance, so why were they not given to me when she first checked me in?

She asked me if I noticed what car was next to the Traverse, and I said it was a Dodge Grand Caravan.  She tapped away on the keyboard for about five minutes and said, ""Oh, here. Ok, you can take that one.""

I walk the family back to the Grand Caravan, carrying the two car seats and our luggage.  I load-up the luggage, and the wife and I spend a bit getting the car seats installed for the littlest girls.  When the family was finally settled (we're now about 40 minutes after arrival at this point), I reached for the key and found none.  Instead, I saw an electronic panel over the key that said, ""Swipe Card to Continue.""  Card?  What card?  My credit card?  I looked for a swiper and couldn't find one.  My wife looked too, and nothing.

I get out of the car and go back to the rental office, and stand in line again.

Issue 5:  If you see a customer is having this much trouble going in and out of your office because of your own service issues, you should address the problem and bring me out of line.

When I got to the desk, I described what I saw with the swipe panel, and she looked dumbfounded.  Another desk person looked at me and didn't know what I was talking about either.  A third desk person, in the back, came out and asked me to repeat what I'd said.  He said, ""Oh, that's a Hertz To Go car"" (or something like that, I forget the exact name of the service).  You can't have that one.  We can't rent that one to you.

Issue 6:  Know your products.  Please.

She then tapped away for an eternity again, and she said, ""Okay, I found you another minivan. Let me go see if it's even in the slot before I give it to you.""  She disappeared for about ten minutes, and then came back into the office.  She said, ""I found you a Kia, and I brought it up to the other one so your wife can move the luggage and the kids.""

Issue 7:  I didn't want the Kia in the first place, remember?  Whatever.  Also, no offer to help assist with the moving of the luggage or the car seats?  Really?

I said, ""We've been here now more than an hour. My family is exhausted. Because this has been screwed-up from the second I arrived now three times, is there anything you can do for me on this to make it right?  Can you throw-in the car seats?""

She replied with, ""No, we don't do anything like that. I can give you a voucher for 10% off your future rental with us though."" I assured her that it wouldn't be a problem, as I wouldn't ever be renting from Hertz again.  She shrugged her shoulders and said, ""Next in line?""

I'm running out of room to finish, but we also experienced a return agent who had NO idea how to use his scanner and took 10 minutes to check us in, and they also managed to mysteriously add a ""Ski Rack"" fee of $98.00 to the bill--on a minivan--in Las Vegas--in Summer. (There was no rack.)",1.0

"I called Premier Lighting, spoke with Tanya, and she told me that she would order a ""sample"" of a chandelier that I liked but was not in stock.  A few days later she called and said that the sample was in and that I could come in anytime to check it out.  My family and I drove across town to get there only to find out that they never even ordered the sample.  Tanya kept saying ""the rep"" said to show you the satin nickel finishes (I know what that is since it's specifically the finish I was looking for)... and then she'd show me a picture of the SAMPLE in their order catalog.  Then when I asked where the sample was, she kept showing me the satin nickels finishes and some other chandeliers that weren't even close to what they promised they would order.  Seriously, quit wasting my time and my family's time and just admit that you didn't have it.

"After reading the good and not so good reviews of this restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a try  We went on a Friday night without reservations. To start off with when we entered your eyes really have to adjust to the very dark dinning room.  There was a couple in front of us with reservations and when we heard the host telling them in not such a friendly manner that they were early we knew this wasn't going to be good...lol.  We were told that the  only seating available was in the bar.  The waitress promptly escorted us to this area that was an enclosed cement floor like patio area.  The table we were offered was this tiny high top that would almost fit two people not very comfortably.  We looked at the rest of the room and there were a BUNCH of table clothed tables empty.  We asked if we could sit at one of those and she just said ""No.""  We weren't even offered a wait time in which we could have been sat in the dinning room or bar/patio tables. The main dinning room wasn't even full.  My husband and I decided to leave and the hostess showed us a back door out.  Not even a little apologetic.  So we ended up dinning at a wonderful restaurant downtown.  So my rating is not on the food but on how they treat their diners.  We won't even give them a second chance.  Not all the reviews have  been great for their food and the prices are pretty steep for a place that looks horrible on the outside and cold on the inside.  O, there is a $5 coupon on their website.  That will cover cheese and bacon on two baked potatoes.",1.0

"I like the food. But Viva Mercados gets 4 stars because they have a vegetarian menu. They also tell you in the menu how they make their soup, rice and their beans. No guess work, no awkward questions, just answers. Now on to the food. I think I've eaten at more Mexican places since coming to Vegas than I did the 26 years I lived somewhere else. There are only a few that I would even consider recommending to someone who likes good Mexican food. This is one of them. In the 4 months we lived in the area, I've been at least 5 times. I am always impressed. The service is great, very prompt and friendly. The food always tastes fresh, and the chips and salsa are pretty much irresistible. I've ordered off the of the veg menu all but one time, and have been very pleased. My favorite is the peasant tacos. They are really a taste explosion.  From what my friends and family have said, the meat dishes are also quite good and very fresh. I've also had their sopapilla's which are quite tasty, but because the food portion sizes are so big, you really have to plan ahead for desert.
Definitely some of the best Mexican I've had in Vegas. It may be a bit pricier than other places, but totally worth it.",4.0

They didn't have the risotto in the Italian station like they did before. Why not? It used to be so good! The pork belly with polenta and balsamic was terrific, but they don't offer it consistently.

Throw in black sesame that is typically hard to find at most dessert places and you've got one happy customer right here :) 

Their soft serve is amazing! Strong matcha flavour and not overly sweet paired with the black sesame that has a nutty earthy flavour, no wonder I get these intense Tendou's cravings. I have also had their sundae's with fruit, red bean paste and mochi and that's really good too.  

I have yet to try their drinks and cakes since their soft serve always calls my name. Knocking off 0.5 stars because their $5 dollar cone is way too big for me. I wish they would have their $2 cones all year around.

Royal resort was a very comfortable hotel. Despite its age, it did not look that old on the outside and the inside. It was very clean and the hotel room was very nice. The king sized bed was great and the shampoo and conditioners left were also the best I've had so far. The pool was absolutely amazing. The best temperature of all of the pools above and it was also opened the latest (until midnight!). Yes, the jacuzzi jets were not working but the jacuzzi has a magnificent water fall on three sides that work just as well as the jets and add a unique touch. Also, many jacuzzi's in the other resorts do not include jets. The staff were quite friendly, helpful and very useful. I would definitely stay here again as it is located in a very good location (right behind Encore). Yes, it is a trek to the opposite side of the strip but if you're a walker I would highly recommend this hotel.",5.0
"Natalie was our bartender and she did an amazing job. My wife and I came in for some drinks and sat at the bar. An older man came up to the bar and orders a drink from her. He was sitting at a table in the bar area where they already had a server. Natalie was very polite and was asking him who his drinks were for. He became impatient and rude immediately. She made 2 drinks for him and the second drink he shouted at her that is was not a ""full"" drink. He refused to pay for it so my wife and I stepped in and took the drink from this RUDE patron. My wife had a similar drink in front of her and side by side the drinks were of equal amounts. Natalie handled this rude person with amazing professionalism. Natalie was amazing!!!",5.0
"Loved it!  We live quite a distance and would not have just come into Notorious Burgers, but I had purchased a Groupon, that we used last week.  The place has an inviting bar and the dining room is club-like with dark walls and wooden booths and tables.  There's a huge picture of Al Capone and other interesting artwork throughout.
We were told to sit wherever we would prefer and immediately a server greeted us and gave us menus.  We asked what items were covered by the 4-course Groupon and he pointed out the couple of items that were not included. 

Then our server, Anthony, came by, welcomed us and introduced himself.  Within two minutes we felt totally at home!  The service could not be improved in any way---check backs were quick, there was time between courses so we didn't feel rushed, beverages were promptly refilled and Anthony made recommendations that he followed up on.  

We loved the food and found it far from ""meh"" as another reviewer described.  The chicken wings were wrapped in top-quality bacon and were huge ---- I swear they were from a chicken on steroids!  They were perfectly cooked and coated in an amazing barbecue sauce.  The calamari was not the usualy ring type, but rather cut from calamari steak.  The sauce it was served with was good, but Anthony also suggested we try the lemon aioli with the calamari --- amazing.  The burgers were prefectly cooked .  My husband had a more traditional burger with bacon and cheese and onion rings, which he loved.  Mine was out there --- with feta cheese and sunflower sprouts (I've never seen them before: reminded me of LIttle Shop of Horrors, and sunflower seeds.  It was fantastic.  The burgers were huge and we took half of each home to enjoy the next day. We took home the dessert that came with our Groupon package because we couldn't eat another thing.  We each got the cannoli which were made while we waited !!!  Can't be any fresher than that.  They were amazing, just like the best Italian bakeries in NYC and Boston.

At the end Joey, the owner, came over.  He was appreciative of our business and I promised him I would write a Yelp review.  My husband and I love mom and pop restaurants and have definitely found a new favorite spot!   When we want an amazing burger, we will jump in the car and ride up from Chandler....yes, that is how good Notorious Burger is.  Worth the drive!  The Groupon enabled us to try a lot of their menu, next time it will be difficult to decide what to order!",5.0

I love this damn place. The Hallah French toast is amazing. The Philly cheese steak will blow your mind and the 5 layer chocolate cake is like a chocolate orgasm in your mouth. Sometimes the wait when sitting down to eat can be long and some servers aren't as sharp as others but the food MAKES everything worth while. Plus I've started ordering for pickup and it's ready in 15 minutes tops. Much faster and eating this amazing food without pants watching Netflix makes it that much sweeter.,5.0
"Very impressed.  I'm from L.A and had a hard time finding a salon that I liked.  I'm in love with Aveda products and that was one of the things I looked for.  (An Aveda salon) 
Also... I was a bit skeptical because alot of stylists have a hard time with my long, curly, course hair.   Phil Johnson did a GREAT job! 
 At first to me he looked a bit taken back, but what I liked is that he asks alot of questions in making sure in determining what it is you really want.   I will continue to go there.   
If you decide to go there.... Look for Phil!",5.0
"I'd never been to an Outback Steakhouse before. Won't bother again.

Appies were nasty - deep fried mushrooms and an onion flower. Salty, dull, tough.

My companions both had racks of ribs and seemed to enjoy them. I had a rib eye steak, which probably could have been very nice had it not been immersed in a salty rub.

The atmosphere is very dated, second-rate, typical theme restaurant, and the Australian theme is pretty laughable. Other than a couple of decent Australian beers (Boags and Coopers) you won't find anything here that you can't get at just about any other mid-range steakhouse in America. You can't even get a burger with a slice of pickled beetroot and a fried egg.",3.0
"It's been 3 days and I'm still fantasizing about our recent dinner at Salt Wine Bar on Saturday night. I'd heard about this Iberian tapas place from friends in past and the word had been pretty good, a few standout dishes were a must try and overall the meal was a great.

I feel like my friends undersold this Ossington standout. Our experience was amazing. We had a later reso, around 8:45pm, and upon arrival had a great cozy corner spot near the rear of the restaurant.

Our server came by and walked us through the menu while explaining the recommended number of tapas plates we should order for a group our size (typically 2 dishes per person). We had 6 people together so this meant we could be frivolous with our 12 choices and order some doubles while really testing the limits of the menu.

I'll be honest, I can't recall everything we had but here is a list of all the items I remember, and know that for the most part everything was amazing and I would 100% order them again: Octopus, meatballs, sea bream ceviche, steak frites, steak tartar, wild mushroom gnocchi, rapini, large sized cheese board...

Some of the above were ordered twice to ensure everyone received a good tasting of it. My one complaint was with the cheese board as I felt that while the taste of the cheeses were quite nice and paired nicely with our meals, I felt it to be overpriced for the portion size that was offered.

Aside from the food, I also imbibed on their smoked old fashioned for starters and 4 of us shared in an excellent bottle of wine which sat around the $75 mark.

As is the case with many Tapas restaurants, when you're ordering so many small dishes at times the price can creep up on you. The average price per head worked out (with booze) to be around $100 by the end of the night, not the highest I've paid but certainly on the pricier side. So conservative diners beware.

Overall, would return (just to have the meatballs and steak frites all to myself).

"Came for the Summerlicious dinner menu, $28 with a starter, entree and a dessert. The place itself definitely has more of a pub feel, they offer a bunch of local beers. Wanted to order the perogies, but since they were sold out, settled for the shrimp tostada for starter. Fish tacos for the main. Strawberry shortcake for dessert.

The shrimp tostada was a shrimp salad on a large nacho on a bed of avocado, topped with a shrimp. Pretty tasty, and good presentation, but a little small. The fish tacos came with two tacos and some duck fat fries. The tacos can vary in size, but were quite delicious. Fries were okay. My girlfriend ordered the truffle oil Mac N Cheese. The truffle oil really comes through, very strong flavour. Definitely worth trying. The dessert was kind of lacking. It seemed to be a shortcake made of store bought donuts. Not impressed here. Overall though, a fun meal.",4.0

"Have gone to this place several times very mediocre service. What really pissed me off as a customer and will make me look for a different place from now on is that I called in to make a reservation, mind you you can do this online or in person just fine they would not put me on the list simply because I called In. Their excuse is no shows after calls I'm sorry but there is no difference in me going online and doing it vrs calling in and doing it. Stupidest thing iv ever heard.

We ended up have a bite each of the 4 and that was it. They were all stale. They were definitely not as good as they looked. We were mad that we wasted our money, and they weren't cheap. We probably should've asked for our money back but were too tired to hassle it. Wouldn't go back :(",2.0

"Brio Tuscan Grille is a chain of formula restaurants serving Northern Italian  inspired food, much like Maggianno's Little Italy  is a chain that serves more Southern Italian inspired food.

It has about 30 locations and is HQ in Ohio. There is another one in Gilbert, AZ.

The decor is sumptious and large, with high ceilings, dark woods, draped white cotton materials in archways and to the center of the dining room, with Tuscan marble color inspired motif in beiges and terra cota, and faux terra cota wall textures in golden orange hues.. 

The bar is a classic marble top with dark wood storage canopy overhead, and several booths where there is no wait. The dining room is very large, almost ballroom size. There is also a large patio for snowbirds to enjoy the Scottsdale winter weather. 

I-Pop plays incessently on the speakers. (I-Pop is Italian top 40s music, not the latest music player from Apple!)

The food is Tuscan inspired but has an American slant to many dishes and ingredients. And like Maggiano's, the dishes are HUGE!

I sat at the bar for lunch and ordered from the Primi portion of the menu (meaning first, or appetizers) a Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Spicy Pepper Shrimp on Grilled Eggplant ($9.95).  

They were served in long narrow oval dishes. The Carpaccio was in a plate about 18 inches long! Nice raw beef, covered with olive oil, capers, and a streak of Aioli. In the center was a stack of arugula in a nice, sweet, but light dressing, and served with 2 triangles of brittle cheese infused bread crackers.

The Shrimp came in a rich cream sauce, with each shrimp laying atop a breaded and grilled Melanzone, or eggplant wedge, with a healthy dose of black pepper throughout to spice it up. The flavors were great, but a little overdone in richness and peppers, and too oily in the eggplant. 

They serve fresh warm bread and herb seasoned cracker wedges with butter, complimentary. Iced tea was $2.50.

Service was very friendly, and professional. All staff wear white shirts and Ties, like you would find in most restaurants in Firenze, Italia..

"I can say I got me some soul food in Arizona! Oh yes, I did! Fried chicken and waffles to be exact! It was my first time trying this combo and I'll have to say that it was quite interesting. I didn't find chicken and waffles as appealing together compared to having each separately though. 

- Tre Tre's: 2 chicken legs and a waffle. Oh my, oh my, was the waffle big. Loved the fried chicken, so flavorful and not dry at all. Waffle was really dense and too filling, also flavored with cinnamon? 
- Buttered corn (served sat/sun only): I pictured a cob of corn, but it came out in kernel form in a bowl. It was like canned corn with butter melted onto it. :(
- Collard greens: Yum, with a hint of spiciness. 

After quickly scanning their menu and placing my order, I found out later that they serve cornbread and red velvet cake. Nom, nom, nom...but I was too full to even think about ordering either. It's a spacious restaurant, no wait for a party of 8 or so on a Saturday afternoon when I came. I would come back for the fried chicken, but I'll pass on the waffles next time!",3.0

"There are better. 
We went with a large group on a Saturday night and had reservation. They were 40 minutes late seating us. That happens but for an upscale restaurant they didn't compensate very well; we had to ask for some apps on the house. The service was fine but not remarkable. I had the Ham Steak which was a good portion but way to salty. The baked beans that came with the fried chicken were underdone but the chicken was good. I recommend getting a salad and adding the steak as that was the best meal that others had. The steak was well cooked and tender. 
Overall, it was not worth the price. There are much better places for a nice dinner. It would be a fine place for a drink before the special exhibits but the bar was pretty full from what I saw. So, go to special exhibits, enjoy the botanical garden, leave the underwhelming and expensive dinner to the tourists.",3.0

"Look, Buca di Beppo will never be confused for fine dining. But it being a family-friendly chain shouldn't preclude it from serving tasty dishes.

We went with the Spaghetti and Meatballs (""our famous half-pound meatballs with our homemade marinara sauce"") as our main and it was, to put it mildly, a disappointment.

The food arrived at the table hardly hotter than warm, but that wasn't the biggest problem. No, the main issue was the unbelievably overcooked pasta. It was soft and mushy and I couldn't believe a restaurant would serve something of this caliber. The meatballs were tough and dry, while the marinara sauce was bland and tasteless.

Our side dish, Italian Broccoli Romano, was surprisingly tasty, though. The broccoli had a nice crunch, and the impressively plentiful garlic gave the dish an irresistible bite.

I ordered the Chef's Special and substituted for black beans instead of refried. Totally overdosed on chips, salsa and queso so when my food arrived I wasn't really hungry anymore. It worked out for the best because my food was way too salty and I could barely eat a quarter of my meal. The beans were especially salty. As in, so salty I could barely even eat them. I don't know if a bucket of salt got dumped into the batch of beans but my beans weren't the only ones that were overly salted. The rest of my food was okay. Nothing extraordinary but I grew up in Los Angeles and we have some amazing Mexican food out here. Maybe my taste buds were on sensory overload since I don't normally even add salt to my food.

"We have been searching for a Chinese restaurant of the caliber of Jade Empress since that palace to oriental cuisine closed more than 20 years ago and today we may have finally it.
Yao Fine Chinese Cuisine was a wonderful experience, the staff was friendly, the food was outstanding and most importantly the prices were amazing!
We started with egg rolls which were large, crispy and delicious without being greasy. The hot and sour soup was delicious without the sharp tang of vinegar that is true of so many other Chinese places.
Yao serves a dish called General Chicken (Similar to General Tso Chicken) that is tender chicken served in a slightly sweet yet spicy sauce with crisp broccoli. It was a treat to be sure, but the dish that really was a hit was the Black Pepper Beef. Strips of tender beef cooked with chopped bell peppers, onion, jalapeno peppers, a delicious sauce all sprinkled with loads of fresh black pepper. Oh my!

"If it was possible to post negative stars I would. After being a loyal member to LA Fitness Bakery Square for 3 years, I tried to cancel my account because I was moving to New York. I walked into the gym 15 minutes before 9am expecting to wait until 9am to officially cancel my account. The person at the front desk told me I didn't have to wait and cancelled my account right then. I verified that my account was cancelled and he said yes, that's all you have to do. 

A week later, I was charged $34.99. I called La Fitness and the manager told me she apologized for the confusion and would refund my money. A week later I called back because I didn't see the refund in my account. She said it wouldn't post for another day or so. I called back a week later because it hadn't posted and she was no longer working there. I called back every week for the next three weeks and no one there could help me. They didn't fill her position  and apparently no one there can do anything. 

Finally I get a call from who I am assuming is the new manager and she refused to refund my money from August. It's mid October.

"Whenever I'm in Vegas, I make sure to go here and have the amazingly fresh oysters and combo pan roast. ALWAYS SATISFIED. Already missing this place, hope to be back soon!!",5.0
Not worth the wait. I heard great reviews from several people. The food was good but nothing to write home about. My husband had the gumbo and I had the combo pan roast. There are so many options in Vegas we won't be back.,2.0
"The food is pretty authentic to some parts of Mexico: it can be heavy, laden with rich sauces, and lots of cheese. The rice and beans are great--it's often the simple foods that are the hardest to do well. They offer a choice of either refried beans or black beans, and either are good, but I prefer the whole black beans. I often order the shrimp quesadillas, they're flavorful but not too heavy. The camarones diablo is another good shrimp dish. 

Another reviewer mentioned the decor is rather vibrant. I've been to quite a few restaurants in various parts of Mexico that have very similar decor (not tourist restaurants). It's not necessarily my taste, either, but it probably reflects what the owners are familiar with. 

The staff are wonderful. Friendly and very welcoming. Some speak Spanish, others don't, but those who do will gladly converse in Spanish.",4.0
"The only complaint I have is Susan the receptionist is so rude and I cringe every time I have to deal with her.  My Veterinarian is Dr. Sue Wiggers and I can't say enough good things about her. She is so very sweet and I can tell she sincerely cares for my dog. She is very knowledgeable and has been cost effective with my dogs skin problems. I'm always bummed when my schedule does not allow me to see her , however I have seen Dr. Montgomery a couple of times and I really like her as well. She is very sweet and cares for my dog as well.",5.0
"I usually don't like food trucks, but this one was great. The fries (aka chips) are not to be missed. The grits that came with my dish tasted as good as the ones I ate in the south as a kid. Chicken smelled, looked and tasted heavenly. I would recommend giving them a try if you ever get a chance.",4.0

"Underwhelmed. It was...good...but...I felt like I was eating at an expensive version of Chipotle. Only dined here once--but I tried everyone's food (4 dishes, we all shared). I will definitely return...at some point...however there are many places in my restaurant queue to visit first.",3.0
"Came here on a Friday evening with my bf and another couple. We had to wait about 45 min to be seated, so I would recommend making a reservation if you plan on coming on a weekend night. 

Food/drink:
-Mango sangria was very yummy and a carafe was enough for four people to have almost 2 drinks each. I would say this is a good deal on the menu. I loved the mango chunks that were floating around in this drink. 
-Fish tacos were good; the fish was blackened tilapia, which was flavorful and cooked well. The dish came with black beans and rice which were super bland. I am from Miami, so I have had very good black beans and rice. Compared to that, this tasted like black beans out of a can poured over rice. Meh. 
-Chips/guac were very good... I liked the guac a lot. It almost had a smoky / bacon flavor to it. The chips were good, especially the plantain and yuca chips. 

Service:
-Service was very slow (30 min to take our order, another 30 min after that to bring our food), but it was a Friday night so I understand. There was some confusion with our order, but I felt they handled it well. Basically, we ordered ceviche and they instead brought out chips with guac. When we asked about it, we were told the guac was complementary. Then our food came, and when we asked about the ceviche, our waiter told us that they mixed up our tables and we got guac instead. Since our food was already there, we held off on the ceviche. They didn't charge us for guac or ceviche, so no harm no foul I guess. 

Overall, this place had a nice atmosphere and the food was good. I've had amazing Cuban/ South American food in Miami, so maybe I am a tough critic, but this place doesn't even compare to the food there. And the price of food here ($15-25 per plate) is pretty steep for the quality of food. I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but I probably won't be back.",3.0
"I'm a vegan so I know how to cook tofu and vegetables. When I go to places like these, I  like to experiment with certain ""meats."" The restaurant is really cute and the service was superb. I ordered the orange chicken and steamed fish with black bean sauce. AMAZING!!! Everything tasted so flavorful. I was very pleased. I even saved room for some mung bean and green tea vegan ice cream. I suggest you do the same.",5.0
BEST FOOD YOU WILL EVER EAT! If you eat meat I guarantee this place WILL change your mind. What you think you're eating and what you are really eating blows your mind. The staff are incredible and practically make you feel like family. The chef comes out and greets all his guest. My first time trying the Veggie House he gave out samples of the Crispy Spicy Beef (which is my all time favorite and I HIGHLY suggest ordering it) to the whole restaurant. I am going for my culinary degree and am seriously considering doing my internship there... if he will allow me ;),5.0
"5 star for food. 2 star for the extremely slow service. The spicy eggplant was delicious & so was the Kung pao chicken. But the service was slow by abt 30 minutes. 10 min to bring the menu, another 10 minutes before taking the order & then more time to get the rice (after getting the entrees) & then the forks few more minutes later. Please improve your service. You seem to have good people.",3.0
"The place was packed when I went for lunch - a good sign! Probably the best Indian buffet I've had in Toronto! The lunch buffet costs $10.95. 

Great if you want a taste of everything. Not quite as good as some al a carte  but what do you expect from buffets??",4.0
"Is it obvious I enjoy the food here.  Had lunch on one occasion.... Pizza was delicious, thin crush the way I like it.  We went for dinner on the weekend and both my husband and I had the seafood linguine.  It was delicious!!!! The pasta was perfectly cooked ""al dente"".  The meal was hot and there  was a generous helping of seafood on our plate.  Will definitely order this again.  My mum had the Fettuccini Alfredo, which was also very good.

The food was amazing!  I ended up ordering the sole because we had just had steak the night before.  It was the best!  So moist and delicious.  They also brought a complimentary dessert for his birthday.  While it's definitely pricey, it was worth it in my opinion and I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Perfecto! Absolutely great place with great food. Service is absolutely amazing, very friendly owner who will take care of any and all of your requests.

Atmosphere is very cozy although I found the entrance to be quite odd but understandable. You have to enter through a side door as opposed to the main entrance during the winter so as not to let in the cold around the tables where people are eating. Regardless the decor is very warm and inviting and perfectly set up.

Food is great, everything is made in house - definitely have a go at the desserts (creme brule was great). They had a new menu which is a bit more expensive but apparantly it's just for the christmas season. Regardless it's a great menu and the food was really tasty! Definitely recommended.

Dinner for 2 including wine will cost you $30-50. Main's $15-$25.",5.0
"Shela at ALW Massage offers an amazing massage experience. She listens to what you have to say about any issues you may be having, then quickly gets to work making those issues go away.

"Friday late night (7/22/2016) was my 1st time out to Sydney's. This was such a fun wine/martini bar! I went with a group of friends to hear a mutual friend sing, and her performance was the highlight of the evening. Their martini list is extensive, however, when I switched over to beer, it took 3 orders for me to get a beer selection (no Stella, and no Mich Ultra even though it was on the menu). Before my husband switched over the beer, he had 1 vodka/sprite, and 2 kamikaze shots, which totaled $30.00! Ouch! Wasn't expecting that! Our waitress Jackie was outstanding; attentive and prompt and very friendly. The place is intimate enough to have conversations, but big enough to move around. We will definitely be back again!",4.0
"Seems like your average sports bar when you walk in, but they seem to find some redeeming qualities. Food was great and at a good price. Our server (Shaun, I think) suggest we try their honey mustard grilled chicken sandwich. It was great and the same price as their chicken sandwich without cheese or bacon. I also had a cup of their clam chowder and it was superb! Shawn took great care of us. The place was obviously busy, but he was prompt and even took the time to chat with us.
I would give five stars, but the decor was very, VERY dated and dark. The wood paneling we sat next to seemed to be peeling off the wall and there were stains on the carpet near us. They decor just makes you feel gross. Paint the walls brighter and get rid of that old carpeting and this place would be the perfect spot.",4.0

So bummed they got rid of their reverse happy hour! I loved walking there after 9 just for a drink. The sangria pitcher is a great bargain but don't expect to share it between two people unless you want to be carried out. Their food is really hit or miss but their desserts are good. If you need to be awake for a week or are interested in having a heart attack you should try their cold brew coffee; it is the strongest coffee I have ever had. The employees on the dinner/table side are really nice but the employees on the store/carry out side usually aren't as friendly. The bartenders in the bar are really nice and prompt.,3.0
"LGO - I am in love with you!  First, you wow me with breakfast (your muffins melt me).  Then your drinks and sweets.  I finally had time to try your pizza.  Why didn't I come sooner?  Boy, I was missing out.  I got the gladiator pizza.  It was very good:  thin crust, crust was tasty, cheese was so flavorful, the sausage was full of flavors too, and there was pepperoni hiding between the crust and the cheese.  The cheese pizza was great too.  My mouth and tummy was a happy camper.  

Why 4 stars?  The service.  It was slow, had to ask for refills, and just painfully to get your server's attention.  The place can get a little loud!",4.0
"One of the greatest meals of all time (not exaggerating either). Had the three course prix fixe menu (note the only have prix fixe menu in either 4 or 3 courses) with wine pairing. 

The first course was a quail salad with an amazing Piniot Gris from France. The second was a foie gras with the size of a filet minon. The second wine was like a port which went well with the foie gras. Had the veal chop as the main course which melted in my mouth. The third wine was tasty but didn't compare to the first two.

Meal and service were amazing. I'd definitely go back. This $250 meal was definitely a steal.",5.0

"Urban cookies and Ollicakes cupcakes are my go-to spot for when I need to brighten someone's day.  I will say that my favorite cupcake flavors are the orangeblossom, coconut and german chocolate.

Bonus, they are open until at least six and that makes my run home a lot sweeter!",4.0
"My boyfriend and I went there after spending the day at the zoo. In the beginning the waiter was awesome. She split a bowl of Lobster Bisque that was AWESOME. And he actually convinced me to get the Ma-hi Ma-hi instead of the crab legs i had my heart set on. The Ma-hi Ma-hi was good, the steamed veggies that came with it were a little undercooked in my opinion but over all everything was fantastic. My boyfriend got the rack of ribs (he was planning on sharing the crab legs with me). He said they weren't ""fall off the bone good but were still pretty good.""

"Service: The guys are great, they tell you their favorite pizza, what they recommend, etc. 

Food: After hauling ass from La to LV non stop, first thing I want is 2 things...a BEER and a PIZZA from here....or tacos from tacos el gordo...best part of this place it's right there (for those who are a frequent stayers at Cosmopolitan).  I take the elevator to their flow, walk in, get a whole pizza, go back, and destroy it.  The flavors are spot on, it's not too salty, not too greasy, it's just perfect. The crust has the perfect crisp on the outside and the warm, soft inside.  Can't expect anything more from that on a pizza.

Ambiance: It's a literal hole in the wall.  On the top floor of the dining/shopping area, you'll spot a bright bluish, purplish light in a hallway next to the elevator, that's it.  It's a literal hole in the wall.  As you walk in, you'll see awesome portraits to a NY style pizza restaurant decor.  It's just awesome.",5.0

When brought to attention of manager he said ""I have got your food covered"" well that didn't make up for the hour and half of our life we won't get back, need less to say - our food comped when we didn't even get to eat it....

"Chompie's is a busy busy place. A 20-minute wait for table is not unusual. Although it is not my favorite New York deli (outside NYC of course), it is not too far off. Food is generous in portion, and tastes homemade. Everyone can find something they like from the very large menu selections. The baked goods are stacked near the entrance, and you can get old bagels for cheap. The dessert counter has some inviting items, like cannolis, but those are very pricey. Overall, if I want a hearty brunch with friends and don't mind the wait, Chompie's is on my list.",4.0
CHICKEN KNUCKLES aka CHICKEN FINGERS are always burnt or cold. The first week advertised was the only time the order was right. The food always taste like it's sitting underneath a hot lamp.

"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Few months back, had springs replaced. First quoted a ridiculous amount, like $800. I said no. Then price went down, $500. I still said no. The guy gets on his phone ""calls his boss"" and somehow magically the price drops to $180! He rings the doorbell to tell me this Lol this is after I said no already, went back in my house and closed the door. I knew something was up, but I had the repair done anyways. 

Now, I need a panel replaced due to a crack, and it buckles when the garage closes. A different guy comes out, this time with a buddy. Says I need a whole new door, due to this little crack. Quotes me $1600 for a cheap door. Lol then price goes down to $800 for a cheap door, I still said no. Then he suggests replacing panel and hinges for $500, I still said no. He Also said he would ""talk to his boss"" to see what they could do on price. This reminded me of how it went down last time. Said no and I will look for another company that won't scan me.

"This place is great! I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews, though if you read them they're pretty lame ie: someone said ""I'm never coming back to this place because there was tomatoes in their carne asada burrito"" what? That's your criteria for 1 star?

Having lived in San Diego, I have high expectations and the only two restaurants in Las Vegas that lived up to this have been this place and El taqueria el buen pastor--the taco truck over by cashman's field. The other places near here:
Alberto's 
Tacos de Tijuana 
Taco y taco 
Are overpriced too greasy and not that good. 

What I like:
-location near our house
-nice workers 
-open whenever we're needing it!
-Decent salsa bar: they have a nice red and my favorite the green. They have cucumbers and pickled carrots.

"The must-try sandwich in Pittsburgh with layers of coleslaw (vinegar-based), fries, meat, cheese, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes between two huge slices of bread.  Yes, that is all on one sandwich.  It feels like a heart attack in a rectangular package but is simultaneously delicious.  I personally love the Angus black steak but the most popular version is definitely the cheesesteak, which I would guess is Pittsburgh's version of the Philly cheesesteak.  I also like the carved turkey breast version as well, which is a good option for a semi-lighter option.  This location is pretty low-key and akin to a bar but ot's usually packed and its prime location in Market Square makes it a popular lunch spot.",4.0
"Okay. A) why would you need to buy alcohol in Vegas? Go to the damn casino.
B) big liquor selection, but not as good as Bevmo. C) Korean favoritism is ridiculous. I mean they sold these kids liquor without even checking ID which is sorta sketchy and seems unsafe. D) Lee has a thick-accent, and is sort of rude when you ask him to locate something for you.

Overall, save your money and drink in the casino (or Bevmo). And tip the paid-to-be friendly/attractive waitresses. Better than dealing with a middle-aged Korean asshole.",1.0

My friend Kenny and I shared a chili which was delicious and I ordered the Hippie Chick burger with potato salad. The potato salad was delicious and the server said they were going to be making their own in house mayo (vs. Just Mayo). The Hippie Burger was pretty good...I liked the beans and sprouts but I'm personally not a huge fan of quinoia.

"I bought a round trip ticket with US Airways just for them to have me walk across the airport to American Airlines & then for American Airlines to send me back to US Airways desk just for check in. The run arounds literally cost me time & I missed my flight because surely I could not get thru security as fast. They refused to refund my ticket or even put me on the next flight. Instead they offered me a standby option and told me I could be waiting at the airport literally all day because every flight was over booked. In the past I have had run in's with American & was very disappointed to hear American and U.S. Airways have been co joined. I ended up buying an entire new round trip ticket thru Delta to avoid the frustration all together.

"I have been to this branch of Nguyen Huong a few times and, like the rest of the world, am in awe of the cheap prices for banh mi (which is Vietnamese sandwiches). This location is attached to the funky smelling Vietnamese supermarket B&T (which sets them apart, I suppose, from T&T). The prices range from $2.50 to $3.75 and the options are cold cuts, super, chicken, vegetarian (which comes with delicious tofu), lemon grass sausage and more. As is typical of banh mi the sandwiches come with coriander, pickled carrots, their special mayonnaise and, should you consent, hot peppers. The problem with that is that they refuse to spread it evenly and one gets a blob of hot spice all in one shot, in one bite and in one spot. Ouch!
On the plus side, all banh mi are made freshly in front of you. 

As to why Vietnamese sandwiches are so cheap well leave that to the wonders of 'mystery meat' and ask no questions.

I prefer their original downtown location for the simple fact that getting into and out of Vaughan Mills is a drag and a chore. Greedy mall owners stuff their premises with so many buildings and businesses that there is always a long line of cars snaking in and snaking out. It is just not worth going to the malls, which have more traffic than the 401 and less parking space than a Wal-Mart with a new shipment of tacky ladies' animal print pants.

The buns on the banh mi are also fantastic. I understand they have their own bakery in North York.

Don't get me wrong, there are still some good things here. The martinis are excellent. They're pricey, but well worth it for the amount of alcohol they contain. I've had the swedish fish and the creme brulee, and both were great.

The food is so-so. Some things are good, and others need definite improvements.

Apps- I've had the baked brie, chocolate bar foccacia, and the spinach and artichoke dip. The baked brie was the best by far. The fruit chutney served with the brie and toast definitely made the dish. The chocolate bar foccacia was also good, but I was imagining it to be something with chocolate. It was a piece of foccacia stuffed with red peppers, olives and mozzarella. Kind of greasy actually. It was good, but nothing special. Same with the spinach and artichoke dip.

Entrees-I've only ever had one entree here, and it was the chocolate bar pasta. I was so excited to see how they balanced sweet and savory in the dish, and my mouth was watering. Unfortunately, I got none of it. It tasted like a bland cream sauce that was barely sweetened. I had to add a ton of salt to it for it to have any flavor. I've always wanted to try their mac and cheese bar, but the quality of the entrees has me thinking I'll just stick to their apps and drinks.

Desserts-This is where they should shine. They have unique combinations, and you will definitely be indecisive in picking just one. I've had the peanut butter mud, belgian chocolate mousse cake, heath bar torte, and turtle cheesecake. All are good, but be prepared to stop eating after a 1/4 or 1/3. The desserts are pretty heavy and sweet, and you're going to want to pace yourself. 

If you come here, I suggest coming for drinks/apps, or just desserts. Doing all these will definitely be an overload. Skip the entrees entirely.",3.0

"I hate giving bad reviews. I know is Vagas and some things cost alot. And alot of people trying to get the same thing can take time. And many people there you might be able to clean the place. But, the employees just act like they don't want to be there. The look on their faces when people ordered. Its hard to put it. Its like I had bad vibes from everyone there. I can tell you they weren't the happy smiling Mc Donalds workers. 
1. Very slow
2. Employees really didn't seem like they wanted to take orders.
3. Very dirty. I think people from the casino cleaned it up before the  Star Bucks employees.
4. I couldn't see Star Bucks aproving this place being a part of their chain. I would think they should send some one out there to check on them.",3.0

went here our week and was surpised the shoyu raman broth was awesome . the noodles themselves tasted abit store bought but with the broth being so good cancelsed that out(for me). overall good food..oh yeah also odered the chicken fried rice it was good.next imma try it with teriyaki sauce instead of soy.,4.0
"The old Cosmo's is now an Italian restaurant.  They offer a few express lunch sandwiches along with the regular dinner menu during lunch.  They don't have fresh pasta which is a little disappointing based on some of the prices.  The service was good and the waitress was pretty knowledgeable.  I tried the bolognese with rigatoni and it was not the best, not sure if it was the sauce or just too many noodles.  My friend had the margherita pizza, which was huge, but again it was just ok.  I think I was expecting more for the price....perhaps I'll give them another try at some point.",3.0
"We visited this cozy Italian restaurant on a Saturday night, we had reservations but the place wasn't overly busy that you would have to wait without them. The decor is comforting, and the waitstaff very friendly. Our waitress even stood and talked to us for a while. 

Our party started with arancini's and calamari. The arancini's were good, but could have used more sauce. I personally like my calamari a little on the chewy side, which this was not. However those in my party who did not share my preferences said it was the best calamari that they have had. 

For our entree's we chose chicken parm, chicken Marsala, and a ravioli dish. My chicken Marsala was delicious. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and my partner was satisfied with his chicken parm although he said it could have used more sauce. 

For dessert I treated myself to a cannoli , and was not disappointed. 

Coming from a town with an Italian restaurant on every corner, I was pleasantly surprised with this Uptown establishment. Only complaint would be the portion size for the price. When dining at an italian place I typically expect to bring half my meal home, whereas these portions came with one piece of chicken per plate. Other than that a great place to dine Uptown before enjoying your night.",4.0

He used this was a request just to sing and he does line dances so he can sing, it's a karaoke show not a line dance show so you can sing.

"Lily S reviewed this place from her recent trip, and I was reminded to review it myself. I was there in march 2006, and I still dream about it. 

UPDATE: I found a stream-of-consciousness blog post I wrote about Tao, so I am pasting it here:

The food- oh, the food! We ate at Tao, the swanky upscale gorgeous GORGEOUS zen styled restaurant in the hotel, where our waiter looked like a cross between Bruce Lee and Richard Gere. Both Gene and I fell in love with him. We sat under a 30' high Buddha who perched on a koi pond, ate delectable food and exquisite drinks. I had a mango something martini, which accompanied the loverly 'Buddha's harmonized vegetables for the minor gods', among other sumptuous dishes. The place is so incredibly beautiful, in that insanely huge budget kind of way. The entry way is lined with bathtub looking pools, filled with rose petals and orchids, with floating candles in them. The walls are lined with Buddhist statues inset in thier own little cubbies, the rooms are divided by floor to 50' ceiling white sheers. Incredible. Not usually does the food match the decor, but in the name of all things holy, it was incredible. Each thing was more delicious than the next, and I don't know how they made the chocolate dessert thing we ate, but it was the most velvety, creamy incredible thing I might have ever eaten.",5.0

"I love Dr. Schneider.  He's like that favorite uncle or family friend that you can't wait to see because he is so nice and welcoming.

I have an eye phobia.  I don't like people talking about eyeballs, touching their eyeballs, or getting close to my eyeballs.  So when I have to go to an eye doctor, I have a mild panic attack.  So much so, that for the first three years that I lived in Vegas, I would actually fly back home to San Diego to see my eye doctor there because he knew about my extreme fear.  But that got tiresome and expensive.

After a recommendation from a friend, I found Dr. Schneider.  He made me feel very comfortable because he lets you know exactly what he is doing or what the test is showing at every step of the way.  He explains what is up with your eyes and how the contacts or glasses are going to fix it.  I've learned a lot more about how eyeballs work, and it has actually calmed my phobia a bit because I know why he's doing each test.

Dr. Schneider has a very distinct voice, and once I was in the kitchen while Antiques Roadshow was on in the living room.  I heard his voice on the show, and it was him!  So keep your eyes peeled for Dr. Schneider when old episodes of Antiques Roadshow come on!",5.0
"I love everything Mark McEwan touches and my experience last night at North 44 was no exception. I first came here five years ago to celebrate an anniversary dinner and have wanted to come back ever since. So I figured with all the Winterlicious festivities going on it was a great excuse to pay a visit.

With our reservation booked (2 weeks in advance mind you) the earliest time available for Saturday night was 9pm and I happily accepted. We arrived a bit early for our reservation but the hostess kindly let us go upstairs to the lounge/bar to await our table. When it was ready she escorted us back down and checked our coats.

We were seated near the front window at a corner table along a cozy banquet. White linens and dim lighting plus a table adorned with candle light lent for a romantic atmosphere. The winterlicious / drinks menus were already awaiting us on the table to peruse. The waiter returns to go over the menus with us and takes our drinks order. He asks if we need a few more minutes with the menus however we already know what we want to order.

A warm fresh sliced olive and white bread plus a dish of creamy whipped butter is placed centre table. I love the briny tangy of the olive bread and cruchy crust of the bread.

For drinks I order the
Lip Sitck Martini - Raspberry infused vodka with muddled fresh raspberries and Champagne
Boy o boy was this baby strong thank goodness it was sweet tasting to balance it off but let me tell you I enjoyed it down to the last sip!

Even my date's Mojito was strong as well but balanced nicely with sweet and minty notes. So I can definitely attest that they don't skimp on there shot sizes.

Onto the meal, this is what I ordered from the Winterlicious line up:

Seared Ahi tuna with Japanese pear, cucumber, Yuzu and chili
The tuna had a nice light seared exterior with a smokey grilled flavour to it. The asian flavoured marinade the tuna sat in was a great accompaniment with a slight amount of heat.

Organic Irish salmon with beluga lentils, yogurt, parsley emulsion and crisp pancetta
The salmon was cooked more towards the rare side (which I like) and very juicy and tender. The black lentils  speckled with sweet roasted brussel sprout halves added some texture to the dish as well as the crispy coil of pancetta was a delightful pop of saltiness. 

Chocolate pot de crème - Chocolate and cherry cookie, toffee crunch
Creamy, buttery rich milk chocolate slightly chilled, I was savored every spoonful I wish it was a bottomless dish!

Even though the restaurant was full to capacity we never once felt rushed or ignored. Dishes came out in perfect timing and our waiter always checked on us and made eye contact with us even from across the room to make sure everything was running smoothly. The meals were beautifully presented and artfully balanced with a wonderful array of flavours and textures. North 44 is definitely an encore hit once again in my books!

The restaurant can be easily missed when driving by as the title is written in white on a light grey background so look out for a picture of an airplane which is displayed beneath the North 44 signage and more easily spotted.",5.0

First off my husband and I wanted to go dancing somewhere FUN in Vegas.  We decide to call the front desk and check to see where would be the place for us.  She said THE BANK!  Ok?  So we get there and the place has NO real line.  Everyone is looking around wondering if they are in line or what.   WHICH IS SUPER  SUPER ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!  NOT COOL!  Then when we get to the FRONT of this no line....line the super cocky guy at the front looks at us like?  WHAT?  He asks us how many in our party.  Before this I see him sending people away if they are groups of guys......=( WHATEVER?  He tells them he is letting in one guy one girl and they just need to get lost.  OK?  So I am thinking my hubby and I are good.  He lets us in after a long wait.  WHATEVER?  I think he thinks his shit don't stink or something?  The dancing was fun but not 30 bucks a person fun.  I felt bad for dragging my husband out who doesn't really love to dance and paying $60 bucks just to get in..........=(  This club isn't worth it at all.  They make you feel like you have to be a group of girls to come in and if you are a group of guys on a Friday or Saturday night you have to pay for a SUPER expensive table or you're not getting in.  GROUP OF GUYS: DO NOT COME HERE  GROUP OF GIRLS:  YOU'RE GOOD COUPLES: NOT A GOOD IDEA,1.0
"Gwen officiated our wedding on 5/14/16 in Scottsdale, Az. We had recently gone to a few weddings the month before our wedding where family & friends had gotten ordained & performed the ceremony...although this was a sweet gesture, it was not professional & did not flow whatsoever. Gwen however was 100% professional & even though she didn't personally know us, she made our ceremony personal & intimate for us and our guests. We got to meet with Gwen a couple months before the wedding so she could get to know us and our story. Throughout our engagement, we emailed frequently to perfect every detail of the ceremony so when the big day arrived, there was an immediate familiarity we shared together. We did a special family vow to my daughter as well. This was so special and truly pulled at everyone's heartstrings! She was worth every dollar and truly made our wedding memorable for my groom and our family.",5.0
"We just moved back to the Burgh after spending 3 years in California.  We always kept track of what was going in the Burgh so this place was on our short list to try when we returned.  Love the changes inside.  We had been to the place when it was Geno's.  We sat at the bar near the end close to the service area which is NEVER a good idea but they were the only seats at the bar.  The draft selection did have local beers so we liked that.  We ordered the mussels and fish and chips.  Both came out barely warm to the touch.  The sauce for the mussels was delicious, however, they should have been steaming when they were brought out.  I was born in New Zealand so I'm pretty picky about my fish and chips which is kinda stupid since it is a pretty simple dish.  I expected the triple fried fries to be amazing but they were barely warm and soggy.  Weird.  The fish.  Ahhhh the fish.  The batter was crazy bland.  The fish was a thick cut and wasn't cooked all the way through.  Now, the only thing that saved this dish was the mushy peas.  I would go back for the mushy peas and that is all.  Well I might go back for a dark and stormy too.  The bartender was very attentive which is always good.

Over general discussion throughout the meal, he found out we were getting married this year.... so, at the end of dinner he brought us out a cheesecake with a very SPECIAL message.

I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in an upscale dinner experience.",5.0
We had never heard of this place until tonight. We met some friends here because we heard of the excellent wine selection. We were pleasantly surprised and totally pleased with our visit. We ordered a couple appetizers and enjoyed them immensely. One of the more notable parts of our experience was the staff. It was obvious that they enjoy working here which says a lot about management and ownership. Next time we come visit we will try the full menu the food looked excellent at the table next to us. After our visit we stroll the shops of 5th Avenue which was an added delight.,5.0
I've been to 5th & Wine a couple times now. It's a nice comfy cozy spot in the heart of downtown Scottsdale. I love their appetizer selection - they have a nice variety to choose from.

I would say improvements would be that the service can be a hit or miss.,4.0

"Akin to an IKEA-style cafeteria, the Grenadier Cafe is decent for what it is: a clean place to grab a bite when you're in the vicinity of High Park but forgot to pack a sandwich.

Will your hunger be satisfied? You bet. The portions are generous. 

Will you feel like you are having a nice picnic in the park? Unfortunately not because of its proximity to a high-traffic road. 

In terms of food choices, they have a bit of everything. There is the usual breakfast fare: eggs, sausages, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes and waffles. Then you also have pizza, steak, pasta, burgers, atlantic salmon, soup and salad to choose from, as well as some options for kids. The variety is astounding, considering the size of their kitchen.

At the end of the day, you can't help but weep at the missed opportunity. For such a beautiful and unique locale, we have the potential for a real wow moment: a Michelin quality restaurant inside a nature setting. Instead I have to be thankful that something is better than nothing.",2.0
"I went to visit this place after reading an article in a local magazine and the various Yelp! Reviews. 

I ordered the Three Meat Combo, Grilled Cheese and (No bean) Chili. 

A note to the wise this is a busy section of The Beaches.  Parking is limited both on Queen St and the nearby side streets.  

All meat I ordered was smoked: 10 wings, 1/3 lbs of beef brisket and 1/3 pulled pork.  The crowd favourite End Bits are not available until after 4:00 pm.  The chilli was decent with moderate heat and good taste.  I would have like some of the corn bread to accompany the chilli. 

The grilled cheese was tasty with cheese, grilled peppers and pulled pork.   However, the price was a bit steep at $11.00

The wings were very good and the server gave me samples of their BBQ sauces.  I liked the following sauces were very tasty with my pulled pork and brisket: Mothers, Black & Blue and Beach.  The peanut sauce was decent but probably better with grilled chicken. 

So why 3 stars.  The brisket had a fair bit of fat making it not worth the price.  The pulled pork was good.  The menu states the owners know how to smoke their meat and BBQ but aren't that much in to running a business.  Sadly there are other places that offer bigger portions at a fairer price while including fries, corn bread and coleslaw with the meal and not making them pricey add-ons.",3.0
"I had to terminate another management company just prior to leaving for a three week trip out of the country while there were tenants ready to sign the lease.  Being an out of town owner,  the timing could not have been worse.  I contacted a number of property management companies but was not quite satisfied for one reason or another.  When I talked to Matt of Five Star Real Estate & Property Management without ever having a face to face meeting, I was impressed.  Matt got to work as soon as we finalized the contract.  He responded promptly to all my emails and kept me posted on the progress.  They got the lease signed and took care of all of the details while I was out of the country.  I am quite satisfied with their performance since they took over a couple of months ago. It's definitely a rewarding and positive experience as an out of state owner.",5.0

Not only are their prices on point but their produce is fresh and their staff is always friendly/ready to help you with finding an item you need. The place is huge so don't be afraid to ask for help!

One of the biggest draws for me is the selection. Nowhere else (not even Walmart) will you find such a selection of foods and flavors. Pumpkin spice Quaker oatmeal? No problem. Shasta soda? Yup. Taco Bell hot sauce/beans? Absolutely.

Keep in mind that this is an employee-owned company and so they do not accept credit cards--only cash and debit cards (just like Costco). Also, be prepared to bag your own groceries.",5.0

The prices of the oils are per drop, so depending on your aroma and what method you'd prefer to employ e.g., lotion, body soap, massage oil the overall price will vary.

The staff: I agree with other people's comments on them, they are a bit strange, a bit cool, and not very friendly.  
The 1st time I went to the store , they didn't even look at me, nor introduce anything to me. The 2nd time, I brought my little daughter with me, and they reacted totally different from the 1st experience. 
I should say thanks for my daughter. They actually serve me a lot better and also introduced what kind of yarn is for this /that projects. Pretty good experience though.

I had a som tum salad for starters. Perfect mix of sweet, sour, salt and spice. The portion was huge!!

I followed that by an incredible fragrant and spicy green curry over jasmin rice with pork. It was wonderful to the nose and palate.

The best thing was the service. I should preface this by saying it was 630 pm on a week night, but I had 3 servers alternating. Incredibly friendly and attentive!!

I had a very long list of all the problems I had but lucky you, I accidentally deleted them from my phone =[ So we'll go off of my memory, and pictures to back them up. 

I also don't know who gave you the ok, but you are not even close to being a 5 star hotel. 

1. Biggest complaint = NO WATER?!?! Ok, its Vegas, who doesn't stay out late to club, gamble, drink? I came back to my room around 2am and there was no water to found anywhere. First I wanted to shower, but nope, no water there. So I proceed to brush my teeth and wash my face - again, no water at the sink either. Ok, lets try the kitchen, notta! If the hotel is going to undergo any maintenance, let your guests know!!! I received no warning at the time of check in, no call, nothing. There was water in the toilet bowl! However, I was soon disappointed to find that there was no incoming water to flush that toilet. 

2. Finally, I was so happy to find that water was up and running in the bathroom and the kitchen the next morning. However, midway through my shower - the water turned freezing cold. I couldn't even get all the shampoo out of my hair because I could not take it anymore. I had to finish up in the sink! 

3. The stove doesn't work. What's the point of advertising that all your rooms come with a kitchenette if the main appliance doesn't even work!? 

4. That morning, I spoke with a representative in lobby - told them about the water and stove issue. I was then informed that the hotel was doing some plumbing work and that someone will be up in my room to fix the stove immediately. Again, why didn't anyone warn the guests of this before so they can plan accordingly? That day, I drove up to the grand canyon and did not arrive back at Vdara till 9pm that night. Not only was the stove STILL NOT working, but the room WAS NOT cleaned either....Needless to say, management was no help at all. 

5. Holes in the towels, classy. I'm sure house keeping would notice since all the towels are neatly folded. But I guess it also didn't matter because 2 towels with holes in them ended up in my hotel room. I have pictures for proof! 

6. I was also a little taken aback when I poured myself a glass of water - there were bits of blue paper stuck to the bottom of the cups! 

7. Worse pull out beds in life. I felt like I was directly laying on a bunch of springs, each poking me individually. The venetian is a much older hotel and I'm sure their pull out bed have been around a lot longer than Vdaras, still I found the Venetian ones actually comfortable! 

8. Surprise surprise. You know those people that flick little wallet sized cards at  you on the strip? The cards with naked girls on them? Yeah, well I found 3 of those cards under the pull out bed. How do you expect me to explain that to my younger brother!? 
Yup, that was the last straw, Vdara no more.",1.0
"Awesome hotel:
+ center of the strip / connected to the Bellagio
+ large soaking tub with separate stand-up shower
+ separate seating area from bedroom
+ 2 Tvs
+ kitchenette w/sit down kitchen table & chairs

2 negs - parking fee (we didn't have a car :) ) & $33 resort fee",5.0
Food was okay but not worth the wait. I tried to go in for my lunch hour and service is slow as can be considering I was only one of two tables in the place.,2.0

"This review is long overdue! I thought I had already written it, but apparently in the craziness of finals I forgot. Anyways, onto my review...

After driving back from California a couple months ago, my check engine light came on and my car was shaking like crazy. Upon referral from a friend, and after reading all the Yelp reviews, I decided to bring my car (Honda CRV) into Valley Automotive. Boy was I glad I did! I got an initial estimate from KC and his staff, but after doing some work it ended up that there was more wrong with my car than was initially thought. However, rather than me having to pay for the additional fixes, KC offered to foot the bill! I was shocked, but forever grateful! The thing that sets Valley Automotive apart from most other auto shops is they care about their customers and want to do right by them. As a graduate student with little money, I appreciate the honest business and work that KC and his staff do at Valley Automotive. I happily referred a friend to them so she could get a second opinion after taking her car to another shop. Valley Automotive saved her money and she was equally as impressed with the service she received!

Apparently my car doesn't like the Vegas heat (who does like 115 degree weather?!) and I noticed that it is leaking coolant. I will gladly be taking my car back to Valley Automotive and doing business with KC and his team again!",5.0
"Pretty miserable experience at this place. Went for brunch and the place was about 70% full, definitely not packed and there was no wait. The server came over and took our drink order quickly but that was about the only thing that was quick about the whole experience. We ordered an eggs Benedict with hash browns (extra crispy) and a black and bleu burger (medium rare) that was supposed to have caramelized onions, black peppercorn patty, and Cajun spices.

40 minutes went by and there was still no food. When the food finally arrived, the eggs Benedict was actually cold to the touch and rubbery, the hash browns were close to undercooked and very far from ""extra crispy"", and you can tell the entire plate had been sitting there waiting for a solid 15 minutes at least. The burger was warm but was completely gray on the inside, totally missing the caramelized onions, no black peppercorn, and whatever ""Cajun spices"" that were supposed to be on there seemed to be just salt. Burger was overall way too greasy as well and that's a shame because you could tell it started as quality ground beef, I could've make something better on my own grill and that's pretty sad. Fries were also cold to the touch and generally unimpressive.

If .5 stars was an option I would've chosen that, but I guess the only positive part of the experience is that the server was at least nice. I won't ever be back.",1.0
"We had a wonderful lunch experience here!  The 3 of us were impressed with our meals and surprised at how great everything was.  The JOEY at Yorkdale was a let down the first time I went. In fact, chain restaurants like this usually leave me suspicious.  We were at Eaton's Centre and starving, looking for a place that could cater to all of our cravings.  We came in the door, there was no line: SOLD!

We had mojitos, they were delicious.  I had the lobster grilled cheese with a side salad.  My friends had a chicken sandwich and the BBQ salmon bowl.  We were all pleasantly surprised with the quality of our meals.  Then, I ordered a piece of key lime pie - also excellent and it was a massive piece.  Definitely worth the money.  I will be back again!  

JOEY surprised me -- thank you, JOEY for proving my snobbish view of you completely incorrect.  You delivered!",5.0

"I love Juans!  I have been coming here for about 10 years and the food is definitely authentic!  I have always had great service and most of the time is is pretty quick.  I have found the owner, Juan, to be very friendly.  The salsa is great and I haven't had anything I don't like here.  Their refried beans are fantastic and my favorite is their green chile!

I highly recommend Juans!",4.0
"Entrepreneurial Opportunity. Innovation. Revitalization. Community. Entertainment. Culture. Fun. Family. Noms. Style.

Seriously, the concept is amazeballs. It is inspiring to be amidst the local musicians, families coming together with their children, young/old locals and tourists creating cultural delight, the delicious options of food and beverage... Definitely worth a visit; bring your friends and family. There is such a strong sense of community and growth that one cannot leave without at least a tinge of hope and inspiration for the future of Downtown Las Vegas. Live music throughout the day and night; a variety to please all ears. Slide down the big tree house slides whether you are 3 or 30... It will be great. The Downtown Rangers help greet and direct and it is helpful to those full of intrigue or at a loss. High safety due to the security patrol which is not abrasive, but does make one feel comfortable.",5.0
Just happened to be driving by and stopped to check this place out. I figured since it was Friday I would bring a few treats in for the office to share. The young kid behind the counter was really friendly and helped recommend some stuff to try and a man who I assumed was the chef/owner came out and told me about the items I was selecting also. It was a little pricey but absolutely did not disappoint. The lemon tart was delicious as was the apple turnover and I practically swooned over the cinnamon roll. Cannot wait to come back and am anxious to spread the word about this little gem.,5.0
"I've only been here once so far and I thought it was a decent place.

I wasn't sure what to make of the sizes when I looked at the menu, but the burger I ended up ordering was humongous and probably the largest burger I can remember eating. I thought it was pretty good, although I'm not ready to call it a favorite just yet.",3.0
Really tasty Cuban food at a very reasonable price. Love the beef empanadas and the Cuban sandwich.    Definitely will be back soon.,5.0
"Came here on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I didn't stay long.  I had an OK time and at the moment, other places really suaded me otherwise.

The place is dark and filled with Asian decor and influence.  It's located in the middle of a Chinatown strip mall with one of my favorite Pho restaurants, Pho Kim Long.  I was baffled as to why there was bouncer, since we were the only reason the place was busy.  There's a bunch of couch seating in the back creating an intimate setting for a small party.  Unfortunately there was no food and I was super hungry :(

The bar was filled with TVs and LOTS of seating.  There was also a DJ there doing Karate Karaoke which helped liven up the crowd.

I had an OK evening.  Unfortunately that might not be enough for me to consider this place in the future.  Chinatown is filled with little jems and I don't really consider this place on that list.  If you're looking for a venue to hold a party and not looking to get an upfront charge to save the space, maybe this place is perfect!",3.0
"This place is very different than most bars in town. It has a bar feel in the front, complete with gaming for those interested in trying their luck. It has couches in both the front and back for those interested in a little more privacy/intimacy. The back area is available for private parties and some nights have DJ's.  The only knock on the place is the lack of food, BUT, there are several restaurants with in walking distance, AND several will deliver to Little Macau! Just ask a bartender for menus or suggestions.",4.0
"We came here for afternoon tea. I've ordered the spam and egg sandwich. The crust of the bread was a bit hard. I had to peel it all off. The hot lemon tea is mediocre. Nothing to write home about.

The service, when you ask them what a Spanish coffee is, they will just tell you order it to try. Again at this price point, I don't expect a lot of service. My brother did say he enjoyed the coffee mixed with milk tea.",3.0
"this place is awesome. went there on valentines night. it's quaint & charming. great service. an extensive greek & italian menu. and no, there was no skimping on portions or flavor just because it's caters to two different types of food. the food is very authentic and very good. i ordered a veal plate with sauteed vegetables. we ordered mussels in garlic/wine sauce and some type of cheese for an appetizer. maybe feta?  the mussels were the best i've ever had and i'm from new england. i've eaten plenty of mussels.  for $10, there must've been atleast 30 mussels on the plate. and this is the appetizer. i';ve ordered mussels at restaurants & sports bars and got about 10  mussels for the same price for about 30 here. and these were by far the best.  the free bread & hummus is excellent. they give you this with every meal. they have italian and greek desserts. the baklava was very good. also had an eclair. this food is not average like olive garden & red lobster. it's well worth going to the arrowhead area. there are also 2 brothers who are new owners. the food is thoughtfully prepared. not rushed and not one duplicate plate after another like other restaurants. the white sauce seafood pizza is outstanding. a good place with good service and good ambiance. the prices are under what they should be. alot of the dinners whether it's chicken, veal, or pasta were all around $11, the most expensive was around $13. and of course, there's cheaper things depending what kind of food you want.",5.0
"The music here is too damn loud. 

Seriously, this is a coffee shop, not a bar. Look at the crowd here -- it's all people doing work buried in laptops. It's impossible to focus when some shitty French indie rock Smiths wannabe bullshit is playing in the background. 

As I write this, the volume went up. Ridiculous.",3.0
"Fantastic service! Great Food!

This is the kind of place where every member of the staff makes it their personal mission to make sure you are well taken care of, it feels more like you are dining among good friends than at a restaurant.  We used a groupon, which gave us $50 to spend on food and alcohol that we only paid $25 for.  We told them this from the start but there was never a hint of reduced service or skimping that you sometimes get when using such a steep discount.

As for the food, well it has been a long time since I left a restaurant and felt ""fully satisfied"".  I had the ribs and my wife had the fish of the day.  My wife had a raspberry martini and we split the oreo cheesecake for dessert.  

The Ribs:  These were perfect!  Both the glaze and the cooking and the pairing with coleslaw and fries.  

The Fish:  Again, perfect, this looked like the kind of dish you could see on a TV show.  My wife left very happy.

The Martini:  I tried it, and it tasted great.  The most impressive part of it however is that about halfway through dinner my wife had half of it still left.  Without prompting our waitress Holly came over and poured the remainder into a fresh chilled martini glass!

The Oreo Cheesecake:  This was a fantastic end to the meal!  A lot of places that serve an ""oreo cheesecake"" basically give you cheesecake with a crushed oreo crust.  This was much better!  The entire cheesecake was crafted to give you that fantastic oreo cream and chocolate with every bite.",5.0
"I've never yelped before and decided with the latest experience I had at Wahoos I had too!!  My good friends LOVE this place and RAVE about everything about Wahoos (they are from Cali).  My friend and I went in the other night to feed our kids and have a cocktail close to home.  Since we had our kids we decided to do them a favor and sit on the patio so we wouldn't disturb the customers inside (keep in mind it was 100 degrees outside too).  The kids had to go to the bathroom once or twice, refill there drinks, they got our order wrong, etc.  All of these required us to go back inside.  We got a very bad attitude from the young hostess and dirty looks, she even TOLD one of my kids to keep the door closed.  Its not our fault when you open your door its stays open.  She could have easily came and closed it or asked in a different way. Seriously the attitude was horrible and then the food came and it was just as bad..  I will say this though, the cheese nachos were good :).  Anyway, I will never return back to this restaurant and don't appreciate the treatment we got, if you have kids and want good food don't waste your time or money going to Wahoos on Horizon!",1.0

And I love how they have some items on the menu that are different but bc you trust the name Binks you trust that the food combinations will work so you try out the new adventure of food and it comes out wonderful!! It's just great. We went during restaurant week as well, and it was perfect. It's that bite of food that instantly puts a smile on your face.",5.0
I will never come back to this location I ordered a Carne Asada burrito that cost $5.99 and every other piece of meat was a piece of fat.I asked for the meat to be well done they couldn't even do that. I have ordered tacos from here before and they are very greasy with very little meat. This is my third time trying this place and I am so disappointed.  I can't believe that they charge $8.99 for a super nacho-chips some meat and beans I don't think so!,2.0

"We ducked into Thai place while hungrily walking the streets of Shadyside...unfortunately we left the place nearly as hungry as before, only to go home and make our own yummy curry.

We were there pre-dinner rush, thus it was not busy, yet we waited an abnormally long time to order. Good trick, because in the meantime we decided to need an appetizer. Once our server acknowledged us, he seemed rushed and hastily answered our questions; yes, the annoying vegan oriented questions. 

Our spring rolls were airy and flavorless :(.

The main dish, a mango veggie curry was so-so. We ordered it with tofu, but did not get any. The sauce was watery, though did have a nice flavor. The mangoes--ripe and delicious. The portion was tiny! And at $15, I find that to be inexcusable. There was not even enough rice to fill up on. Granted, we were two people sharing one dish, but we usually have no problems, due to the American sized portions we have come to expect. Bottom line is that the value did not match the price. For $7, this would be a three star review.

Our server resolved to be friendly around check time. We were accidentally charged for another table's bill, but we noticed and the problem was fixed, as far as we know.",2.0
"This place was not bad at all! Ordered through Postmates for some midnight meal. Got the white pizza, onion ring and Caesar salad. Pizza came cold, but that's expected since it took 1 hr for delivery through postmates. Warmed it up in the microwave for 30 seconds and it was great. Onion was delicious and managed to stay crispy. Caesar salad was simple, romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese and standard Caesar dressing. They got it right and it tasted decent.  

I read the other reviews after I already ordered the food. So far so good, no food poisoning yet, so they can keep their 4 stars.",4.0
"The food is a 4- the service bumps it down to a 3.
The waffles are very nice and the servings are big. The fact that they're made with potatoes is a cool touch. Overall worth going but not in my top brunches in T. (still v. good though!)

The problem is that the servers can be very brusque. We were waiting in doors because it was a cold day and there were seats for two available so we weren't taking up any seating but one server kept coming up and making comments even though no one was being harmed by us being there and we'd ordered drinks while we waited for the rest of our staff.

When we sat down we got a table of 4 for 3 people and 2 min after we sat another friend joined. They made a huge fuss how they dont seat until the whole party is there, which makes sense, however there would be absolutely NO difference to the table we'd get between 3 people and 4 people.

It just felt like they were very persnickety which put a damper on the beginning of the meal.",3.0

My boyfriend often leaves the sides of beans and rice unfinished at Mexican restaurants but he polished off every bite this time because even the sides were so good!

The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right??

The remodeled location looks nice. Door guy was friendly as we walked in. The bar had a ton of beers on tap however the service at the bar is horrible! Walked in and sat at the bar with perhaps 10 other customers who were already sitting there. There were 2 bartenders working and we were not even acknowledged for 10 minutes. As a previous bartender I'm a tolerant customer since I know how things can be so I will give a tip to these bartenders...if you have new customers that sit at your bar and you are going to make the service well tickets and/or make the other patrons drinks before you greet the new customers at the bar then at least acknowledge their existence and tell them you will be right with them.,1.0
"I live down the street from Super Jumbo, with several asian buffets in the area - and this is my favorite since it opened.

The food is good and wide ranging  My favorite is the fried plantains and stuffed shrimp. The price is right, the service is good. I normally dont hit any particular buffet more than a few times because I have so many choices in the area as well as Las Vegas. 

Of course, this being a buffet, the food isnt going to be not great after being out in hot trays for awhile, but go before 7pm.

The weak spot in the food are the deserts - except for the fresh fruit, I would avoid it, including the frozen ...""ice cream"".

My way of rating a Vegas buffet is ""will I go back?"". I keep going back. 30 times at last count.",4.0
"Had to kill time in the area. 
It happened to be dinner time and I found myself in front of Pazzia. 

My first impression of the place was that it was really cute ! When we first walked in, there were no other patrons. I was worried, but it would have been too awkward to walk out. Thankfully we decided to stay! Within about 15 minutes of noting the fact that we were the only patrons, more people came in. By the time we left, Pazzia was at full capacity. 

The owner-chefs are your servers as well. They were super friendly.

Prices are very reasonable! We ordered: two appetizers (bruschetta, salad); two bottles of sparking water; two generous portioned entrees (pollo parmigiana, shrimp angel hair pasta); and lattes. All this plus a tip was under $100.

If this place wasn't so far from my house I'd be here everyday.

I have also had the ""Sloppy Jose"" which was very good. The wings are pretty good too. The ""Honey Hot"" is a spicy treat, the ""Medium"" was perfect, and my wife loves the ""PB&J"". We also tried the ""Moonshine Mary"" and it was one of the best Bloody Marys I have ever had!",5.0
"They have really done a good job of keeping up with business. You have the ability to check in online before you arrive and see how long the waot is.

I  very pleased with Ryan and Ashleigh as stylist. They both go beyond the normal to help you look good. Thry like their jobs and it shows!

Prices are good ; coupons are available on your receipt for $1.00 after each haircut when you complete a survey.",4.0
"After waiting at the podium for 5 minutes, the hostess finally comes out and greets us. We then tell her we have 6 and one child. Her response was ""sorry, we don't allow children under the age of 6, they're a liability."" This is absolutely absurd. Every person stepping into the building is a liability... I have worked in the hospitality business for approximately 20 years and have never heard of such a thing. Pretty sure it's illegal. After leaving in disgust, we walked around to find out nothing else in the area was open at the time. If I could leave zero stars, I would. After reading many reviews, I'm glad I didn't waste my money. Do yourself a favor, keep walking. You can see the view at the top of the hill.",1.0
Amazing! Quick to get in even with the crowd! I went on opening day as a huge fan from Virginia it was great to have my favorite again!! Fun atmosphere! I am a lesbian and still support Chick Fil A because they are amazing!!!,5.0
"There aren't many hand pulled noodle shops in the city yet, so this place is a nice change. I got the beef brisket with the funny looking triangle noodles. The beef brisket was so tender and delicious. The broth was alright and only slightly spicy despite the big red pepper they had on the menu. The letdown was surprisingly the noodles. It's much chewier than I'm used to, which doesn't work well with big noodles like the one I chose. I'd pick the thinnest noodles available next time because of the chewiness and firmness. The place is tiny so expect to wait or get it as takeout.",4.0
"Seriously this club saved the night!!!! We were in Vegas on a slow Thursday night after Labor Day weekend and the bars/clubs in the Palms were closing at 2am. WTF?? Thank god for Drai's and thank god I heard some nerdy cab driver talking about it. We got there around 3am and the doorman were pretty cool - I talked them to getting me n my man (and three other stragglers we met at the Palms) to getting us in for free. We all got in for free (even the dudes). Drinks were like 15 bucks each, so expensive and not that great, but whatever it's Vegas. The DJ in the Hip Hop room played really good music, and the crowd was fun! We didn't leave til 6am when the club started to empty. I will definitely come back to Drai's next time I'm in Vegas for some after hours dancing :)",4.0
"Been excited for the opening of this Downtown bar for awhile now, and the place lives up to the hype. Let me join the chorus of Velveteen Rabbit lovers and say that this whimsical place, owned by two charming and beautiful sisters who work behind the bar, features excellent craft cocktails and a rotating selection of craft beers, artful yet totally unpretentious decor (mismatched furniture, cracked mirrors, and local artwork on the walls), and of course great music. This is gonna be my new go to place whenever I head Downtown on future Vegas visits. Great stuff!",5.0
"Some of the best sushi I've ever had.  Lou, the sushi chef, is so pleasant and a really great chef.  Their lunch combo, $9.95 for 2 rolls under $6, is what I went with today.  I tried their Green Roll with cucumber, avocado, and asparagus and their Shadyside Roll, which was like a Philly Roll.  I liked the Green Roll better because it had the right ""feel"" for sushi; it was crisp and had a nice snap to it.  The cream cheese just threw off the texture of the Shadyside Roll, but it was still good, I'm just not used to cream cheese in my sushi!

I sat at the sushi bar, so I didn't get to experience the tables or the service there, but Lou was attentive and made sure we were taken care of.  It did seem like they were doing a decent business for lunch.  When I worked in Sewickley, a lot of my co-workers would come here.  It's probably for the best that I waited until after I left Sewickley to experience China Palace, otherwise I'd be here every week.",4.0
"Seriously the most honest genuine people, I wouldn't trust anyone else. I have been going to this place now for three years and the service and honesty never falters.",5.0
"So in terms of a bar, Beauty is pretty average. They have a standard assortment of liq and beer but really nothing special. They have a couple beers on tap, and the standard drinks, and they are all over priced. Expect to play around 10 bucks for a beer/cocktail.

Part of the artsy downtown scene, Beauty Bar attracts the traditional people you would expect in East Fremont.. hipsters. This place is loaded with them, especially on First Fridays. Skinny jeans and thick glasses everywhere. Its not a bad thing, but just remember thats the clientele this place caters too.

My only complaint about this place is that its tiny. Its real small. Its categorized as a dance club but I have no idea how they could free up some space for a dance floor, in fact I have never seen it.

The cool thing about the place is that it does offer a venue for some genuine artists. Everything from spoken word performances, bands, art exhibitions you name it, can be featured here. They def get props for supporting the local art scene. On top of that, they been known to attract some substantial talent like Bloc Party, Ladytron and the B-52's, not bad. The place itself has a cool look: 1950's beauty salon, think Edward Scissorhands. 

But really, if your not here for specific event, I can't imagine wanting to stay here for more than a quick (albeit expensive) drink.",3.0
"I'd give this place a 4 star if it wasn't so expensive. $6 for a matcha latte...I wonder if there is a significant difference between this and the $5 green tea latte at Starbucks...The one at teaopia is definitely less sweet and more bitter, but does it really have all the antioxidants as it claims? Who knows.

What I think teaopia needs to work on, nevertheless, is its marketing. I walked in assuming that this was going to be another type of David's Tea, but it's not really. It has the similar elements of loose tea leaves sitting in cans waiting to be sniffed, but it also serves all types of other drinks, like smoothies, iced drinks, tea and tea lattes, and even *gasp* espresso type drinks. 

The place would be pretty cool if it didnt go above and beyond the Starbucks prices. People complain about paying an arm and a leg for Starbucks drinks...well if you wanna hang out at Teaopia, be prepared to give them your first born.",3.0
"Walked past this new place a couple times before trying it. Had a good opportunity to try it out today for dinner and was not disappointed. It's fast casual Asian food - the classic bowls are enormous, easily enough for two meal (not complaining). You pick a starch, a main dish - I chose beef Szechuan which was delicious,  and a vegetable.

I tried the dumplings which were excellent and these little cheese balls which were tasty too.

You receive a fountain drink with the price of the meal, which is nice.

The service is very friendly, the food is fresh, authentic and bountiful. Great dinner and lunch spot, didn't get to try to breakfast but I've heard it's really good as well.

Certainly with a try when on the south side.",5.0
"We came in with a big party for my daughters birthday, had a reservation, our waiter came by to check on us, his name was Roberto and he was AWESOME.  He took drink orders and did not mind taking food orders for appetizers from some and waiting for others to come in later to get theirs.

The entire evening, he was very attentative and really cared about our well being.  He also had other tables besides ours, and through the entire night his attitude was above reproach.  He was so good at what he did he should be a manager not a server.

I have been to many places and our server here was one of the best I have ever had.  The food was aweseom as well, the portions are way more then one person can eat, so we did a lot of splitting.  At the end of the meal, he made sure the cake we dropped off earlier was ready for us.  When we were all done, he was nice enough to do separate checks for people who wanted them.  I am telling you at not time did his attitude ever change from AWESOME!!  He is a true asset to this company and I made sure he was well compensated for putting up with the crowd we had.",5.0

"Décor is interesting, and they bill themselves as 'farm food with a twist' or something like that.  That translates into 'everything we serve is so freaking big you won't ever finish it, so just get over it'.
 
I ordered the BBBLT with a salad and could only eat the side salad and took the entire monstrosity of a sandwich on the plane ride home.  
Ross got the cheddar, avocado, and hardwood bacon-stuffed burger, with fries.  HUGE and delish and he didn't finish it all.  

Both sandwiches came with a huge steak knife stuck in the middle, guess to keep everything in place during transit.  

Overall, I'd go back - would like to try their breakfast next time.",3.0
"Breakfast food !! Heard about this on the food channel and our hotel (the cal) was so close we decided to walk down and check it out! 

Important stuff- 
- located in the plaza hotel on fremont, this location shouldn't be too busy 
- waited only about 10-15 mins for a party of 7 around 12pm 
- HUGE portions, I would say definitely share !! Unless you're a large hungry man 
- prices: quite reasonable for the size around $10-$12 an entree depending on which 
Service- great, super nice & friendly

We got the avocado bacon scrambled plate ( something along the lines of that) lol and it was huge, it came with a biscuit, a slice of watermelon, a slice of orange, and potatoes. I split this with my sister and it was more than enough for both of us. We asked for no onions and they brought one out for us that did have onions :( but they gladly took it back and fixed our order! Overall the dish was mediocre, nothing to special in my opinion. It might have been because we didn't try their specialties but I was still kind of expecting something super delicious. 

Anyways, overall still good. Might come back to try one of their specialties!",3.0

It was okay, but.. stay with me here... too many toppings. I just found it a bit overwhelming. The Hubster had the Diavola, which he greatly enjoyed. 

Service was friendly, and the place was packed on a Saturday evening. 

The place was fine, but nothing really stood out for me.",3.0
"I've been meaning to try this place due to rave reviews from a friend. I do like this restaurant, but I find the food to be mediocre.  I ordered the lunch special: Margherita pizza,  and added mushrooms and cherry tomatoes ($1) for each add on.  I chose the tomato bisque as a side.  I found the pizza to be okay: the pizza was soggy,  and I would have appreciated it to be served a bit warmer than it was.  Great size though,  it was just enough to make me full after having the soup as well. The soup,  on the other hand,  was quite good.  The service was friendly,  and the interior is comfortable and not too noisy. I would come again, just because of the decent pricing and because I live close by.  However,  I will be looking for another pizza restaurant with a more  solid tasting slice.",3.0
"My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago to this restaurant as we had heard from a couple of people that it was a good place to go to. Maybe we just went on a ""bad day"" because it wasn't that great. We went on a Friday evening and the place was nearly empty. Our drinks arrived pretty quick and our order was taken, but I noticed that other people had the ""loaf"" of bread We seriously asked about 4 different waiters where our bread was and they all said the same ""I'll get it for you right now"". They would walk off and 10 minutes later..nothing. Well we never got the bread and when our food finally arrived. It was bland, cold, and dry. We did order a dessert to split and that was actually the only good thing about the experience...",2.0

"Came here for dinner after a friends recommendation. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance.  Pretty cool stuff all over the place like the rooster painting and figurines as well as the framed record covers.  

It wasn't crowded but there was only one waitress and a bartender that was also waiting some tables, so service was a bit slow but they were super friendly and helpful.  

I got the vegan soup that was described as, ""vegetable soup"" and was surprised by the intense cinnamon aroma.  It was a generous serving but wasn't  impressed by the flavor, or lack there of, aside from the overwhelming cinnamon that seemed to blanket all of the actual vegetable flavor.  I doused it in hot sauce in attempt to over ride the cinnamon to no avail. However, the house salad with homemade tomato vinaigrette dressing was great!  And my partner in crime thought the meklenburger and mashed potatoes were tasty!",2.0
"The staffs are friendly and the place is clean and simple. 

Extremely satisfied. Reasonable price for a 4 month old puppy.

Also, love the fact that they open at 8am. Perfect for me bc I'm such a busy person and would like to get this out of the way first. 

They are fairy new and booking an appointment isn't so bad, but I know they will be super busy later bc of their excellent work.",5.0

"This is the worse hotel that I ever have seen.
I stayed day/night at Toronto downtown for personal business. I reserved ONE night.but reception put TWO nights in reservation. Hotel was full of hookers and prostitutes at rooms and bars.

I have somebody knocking the door drunk offering sex for money at 12AM.
The night was terrible. I could sleep. 3AM left neighbor room  and 5AM and right neighbor room was super noisy with sound of SEX.

I left the hotel early in the morning next morning.   7AM
while after some weeks I see in my online banking that the hotel charged me for two nights.

The hotel service even didnt help me to take my big luggage to my room.
When I asked for internet they mentioned that I have to pay extra for it.
Every item like water/tea/coffee in the room is not free you will get charged for them

I contact the hotel manager twice. and he/she never call me back.

I dont recommend this hotel at all to anybody.",1.0

I live the framboise beers sweet and tasty!  Service is focused on the upsale which I really didn't like and left early because of , whatever I know they are busy.

"So so bad...the whole experience was bad. The food court is small, noisy and seems kind of dirty. 
The food was...ok? I had the soup and half sandwich which was bread with something inside. The soup was soupose to be clam, but it linda look like sour cream with artificial flavour and had chuncks of something inside, but I'm not sure of what.
The service was polite to a certain point.  They clearly didn't have the patience to let me chose much less to answer my questions. I didn't dare to ask for any especial requests, that's for sure.

"$20.95 AYCE lunch. This was the shortest amount of time I've ever spent in an AYCE sushi spot... We left without getting nigiri.

Maybe we just came on an off day. The place was almost empty during prime lunch hour. It's located in a weird unsuspecting strip mall, which has a billiards place we used to visit in our dating days. Oh, the memories of our young love! Anyway...

Le sigh. Our rolls, even the hand rolls, were falling apart. The fish tasted a bit off- the salmon wasn't rich and buttery. I asked for a veggie roll, even clarified twice after he asked, and still got a veggie tempura. Everything was covered in sauce, especially eel sauce, even though there was no mention of it in the description. Normally, sushi spots are very good about listing everything in and on the roll. All of the rolls we ordered tasted the same, oddly enough. The Naruto roll was filled with so much imitation crab and so little of the other fillings that were supposed to be in it that I had to force myself to eat it. And right after that is when we left. 

The hostess and waitresses were so sweet though. And our ice teas were also delicious.

Unsatisfactory- this is what I get for cheating on Umiya.",2.0
"While I can't speak for the pizza (yet!), I have had two different pastas and sandwiches, both perfect and delicious. The larger portions of the pastas are LARGE. I am no light eater and that meal put me out like a light - although that may have been partially due to the fact that I was eating pasta :). The philly cheesesteak sandwich was excellent - probably one of the best I've had. 
The store/restaurant itself is very quaint - an Italian style grocery with a small amount of seating. The staff while kept busy is friendly and quick.

"Out of all the Charlotte local newscasts, this is my least favorite station. I think it maybe has something to do with their colors & how it just makes it seem so old to me.

After that, I just try to stay away from their broadcast, considering I could find much better info on several other stations.",2.0
"I have had multiple appointments here and have been pretty satisfied until yesterday when I went in for ""highlights"".  I went in with a friend and we were both assigned a phase II stylist.  We both asked for Jamie G. - awesome and amazing- however she was unavailble - I had Alexis and her trainer (Jessica is her name I believe).  I was very specific about just highlights because I don't have the time to maintain an all-over color and wanted to maintain some of my own roots/hair to blend.  I even questioned what she was doing during treatment - making sure she know I had never had that done when I came in for just highlights before..... When I walked out of the wash room my friend didn't even recognize me saying how ""light"" my hair was - at my first sight in the mirror I think I was in shock...there was nothing left of my original hair/roots - they said they did highlights with low lights...whatever that means - Worse - they kept telling me it ""looked great""...it is CLEARLY not what I asked for and I have been in hiding since I left there - my son says I look like an old lady trying to be young, others have said it looks like an old lady with a platinum Christina Aguilera look... needless to say - I have worn a hat everywhere.  The earliest they could schedule me to fix it will be a week!  (it will be a very long and embarrassing week!  Not sure how I could have been any more specific with what I wanted but definitely know that once this mistake is fixed I won't likely get highlights there again.... just cut and style - seems they are great at that!",1.0

"At one time, this casino held the world record for number of rooms. That was long ago an has been greatly surpassed in last few decades. It has a great location on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd & Tropicana Avenue. Stopping through on a popular weekend meant we were paying a fairly high price for a room...same room you can get during off season and midweek for just a couple Andrew Jacksons! BEWARE of previously unmentioned fees!...like a ""resort fee"". Hello, what exactly is that $29 for anyways?...it doesn't say ""resort"" in the title. Overall, the hotel/casino is nice...it is attached to the Luxor via a air conditioned tunnel/archway...which is also connected to the Mandalay Bay Casino. There is a free tram that goes between the 3 of these casinos.

"Being a woman and a senior on a very limited budget seems to work against me when repairs are needed on my vehicle. Because of past experiences, I asked my son to take my 2004 Dodge Durango in to the dealership. He is very mechanically savvy and knows my vehicle well since I am the original owner.  My SUV was taken in for full diagnostic at a cost of $150.00 to confirm a problem that another mechanic had diagnosed. Came back with confirmation with an estimate of $1300. I had two other estimates for the same work at $600 and $800; both were reputable independent shops. My son and I agreed that the extra $500 (at least) would be worth the assurance the repair would be made correctly. Imagine our surprise when my son and I went to pick up the vehicle yesterday... paid the $1324 due and went to our separate vehicles being totally confident SUV was reliable... Pulled out of the parking lot and drove less than 1/2 block when the check engine light popped on! Exactly the reason for paying the $150 for diagnostic to be run in the first place! What happened next is what sent my blood pressure soaring! The service advisor was extremely rude... And started spewing half truths.... Fortunately, my son was there and could respond politely but accurately. I shudder to think how I would have responded had I been alone. Apparently the work was done but no one did a test drive... Really??? Right now the vehicle is still at the dealership. Another day without transportation. Should anyone really have to encounter this attitude when a lot of money has been spent? It seems they know you're at their mercy... For a senior with limited funds, I am totally stressed by this surprise. I am hoping it will end well and will update with the final outcome. Bottom line, it's good to know they don't discriminate bad attitudes against just little old ladies...",1.0

I've been here twice and both times have had excellent food and service.  It gets very busy on the weekends even in the afternoon. If you don't mind sitting up at the counter you can usually be seated quicker.  They have a HUGE menu of everything breakfast.  I tried the Cajun prime rib Bennie and couldn't have been happier.  It features scrambled eggs and sautéed mushrooms on top of buttered garlic toast with shaved prime rib and topped with a Cajun hollandaise sauce.  Phenomenal!  Our waiter suggested getting the eggs poached which is the traditional style of eggs Benedict.  It was perfect.  The hashbrowns were cut thick and buttered and had that crisp layer on top I love.  Our coffee never got below half full before our waiter was around to refill it. They were slammed but we got our food quickly.  This is the way you do breakfast. Thank you Sunrise Cafe!,5.0

"Friday night Memorial Weekend. We arrived around 645p. The wait was only 5 mins. The staff were all shocked how slow it was. It's usually an hour wait or longer. Hostesses were very friendly. Salads, ban chan & all the fixings already at the table when you sit down. 

Server promptly greets us and ask for our order. We ordered the small beef combo for 2. It's $54.99. It was more than enough food. We had leftovers. 

The servers were all very attentive and friendly. They prefer to do the cooking for you. Each time I tried to cook they're right there taking tongs from me. They are very polite about it. Saying let me take care of that for you. They cook the meats to perfection, how you like it. 

By far the best  Korean BBQ we've eaten at so far. It's a little pricey but the quality and service calls for it.

"Keegan's? More like Barf-gins. 

The food: Low quality. Our wings came out completely charred, Brussels sprouts were slimy and gross, shrimp tacos were overly salted. Chicken came out in a side dish with blue liquid on the bottom (chicken and detergent?)

The service: Our waitress, Teresa, slammed our food down on the table and never came back to check in and see how things were. Our order was wrong. Teresa also didn't bother to acknowledge the fact that we literally barely touched half of what we ordered when she dropped the check and ran off.",1.0

Nice portions!",4.0
"As a group sales manager from a neighboring hotel property who would often refer my guest to what I would describe as hidden Las Vegas gem, I am disgusted by the way I was treated by the manager Marie. She was rude and not customer service oriented when I had brought visiting family members in for dinner this evening. After spending a hefty bill bringing in a party of 8. To start one meal was about 20 min late to the table after everyone else had received their entree. Which was fine when the waitress returned several times and insisted the meal would be right out. At the conclusion of dinner the bill was presented at a certain amount. When at the cash registered the total amount then jumped significantly. They explained the late meal was never added to the check and that was the increase in price (indicating the meal was never sent to the kitchen, if that was the case the server should have honestly communicated and we would have canceled the meal.) nonetheless Marie the manager was a total bitch and insisted we pay which we did. With the way we were treated management at the Peppermill can count on never getting another referral from myself of my staff in the future! #somuchforalasvegasgem

"One of my favorite photos is of a group of my very closest friends wearing wigs and sharing cauldron of alcohol at a booth in the Fireside Lounge. It was the night before my wedding. Our props were impressive--a set of hillbilly teeth fabricated by my friend's orthodontic stepdad, bolas, dreds and curly blond wigs. These luxurious party materials, and the classic Vegas setting of Fireside lounge, set the stage for a full evening of bacchanalia that (we thought) would leave us too tired to party like rock stars the following evening for the main event. If anything, it fueled the fire.

I go to Fireside lounge to enjoy its big red booths and to sit and mingle. Many a fun nights start or finish at this strip location. The free nuts can partially undo a spontaneous alcohol binge. 

Unfortunately Fireside installed TVs in all the booths a few years ago, which diminishes its classic and intimate appeal. Why turn the fireside lounge into a showcase for music videos? That's why I can't give it five stars. 

Still, Fireside is a must-see Vegas attraction.",4.0
"Not a bad store. It is rather small and cramped and I found things not always labeled so you had to rummage through racks and find tags to see what items were as some things will typically look the same but are quite different.

I found most of what I needed aside from a multi-tool that had both a Phillips and a Flathead screwdriver. This was coughed up to it being Halloween which is their busiest time. Not sure who is buying a specific multi-tool just for Halloween, but okay.

The owners were very nice and helped me find most of what I needed after browsing for awhile. Hell, they even had WileyX sunglasses as they became a distributor recently so I snatched a pair of those up too.

Overall it wasn't terribly bad. It worked. Not sure there is another place to go to buy military surplus items. Oh and call before you head there on a Sunday. They aren't always open.",3.0
"In the middle of making a life changing commitment, i felt an overwhelming need for balance, focus, reassurances, and peace with myself. Anita recommended i try Reiki. Having never had a Reiki session before i was unsure what to expect.  Anita was very informative in explaining and making me feel comfortable and at ease in stepping into the unknown. From the moment our session started i was very comfortable and felt an overwhelming peace and tranquility that made me feel very relaxed.  I left the session satisfied with my outcome and feeling more relaxed and peaceful than i had in days.  I would highly recommend Anita for any type of massage  but especially if you are new to energy work she is very attentive to your needs and her attention to detail and quality of care make Anita an exceptional therapist you wouldn't want to miss out on.",5.0

"I'll keep this very simple and short:

Food: had stacked salad, chicken skins, cheese balls, the beef entree and the fried chicken entree. Not impressed with any of it. Mostly soggy, bland and too much corn bread. Beef was entirely a wad of fat. Menu looks good on paper but the execution needs work. Expected more from the Crudo gang.

Drinks: mediocre and inconsistent. Had several signature drinks and they were...well..meh. They are trying hard but just misses the mark.

If you have a lot of time for a car service, Larry Miller is a good stop.  

I came in Monday morning 10am and there was a 2 hour wait.  I was immediately helped by a representative who took down my information on a handheld tablet computer.  Requesting the service was quick and efficient.

I just road tripped 700 miles, and my car looked like a bug trap.  The rep was kind enough to offer a quick rinse over my car.  

Although there was a long wait, the store offers free food and a shuttle service.  The food was just coffee and pastries (I admit the poundcake was pretty good), while the shuttle service will take you anywhere close.  I had a cool friendly driver who took me to the local Dessert Sky Mall.  I had a long wait, but the mall trip made it a lot better.

Stop by if you need your car maintained and are within 15 mile radius.",3.0
"A friend of mine and I were talking about this place the other night and it reminded me that I had been wanting to go for quite some time.  My husband and children LOVE pizza, for the most part I'm just meh about it.  I like weird pizzas, or pizzas with a lot of toppings, because as Rocco DiSpirito said in an episode of ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" (and I'm paraphrasing here) cheese pizza is a tough thing to master, the dough, the sauce, and the cheese have to be tip top the best, have to work together, or it bombs.  If one part is off, the whole thing is shit.

Anyway, back to Naked Pizza.  I try to eat pretty healthy, I do veer off track sometimes, but I try to avoid high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, all that loveliness that the food industry is trying to tell you is good for you (but isn't!)  My oldest child and I both have asthma, so we have to watch for nitrates and MSG in foods because it can aggravate it (if you have asthma and aren't watching for these things, cut them out and see how your condition improves for the most part!)  The sauce has no HFCS, the crust has no hydrogenated oils, and their meats are nitrate free.  Oh happy day!

I ordered a 12"" pepperoni pizza for the kiddos and a 10"" superbiotic for myself, with cheesy breadstixx with basil.  There were 2 kinds of Jones soda and Sweet Leaf brand sweet tea for grabs to drink, so I got 3 bottles of sweet tea and called it good.  It was $27 for the pizzas and breadsticks, with an additional $6 for the drinks.  I'm not against this price because a) I would easily spend this at other pizza places (I don't do Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's) and b) good food costs money.  They offer a military discount, which is lovely, and if you let them know it's your first time there they'll give you a 50% off coupon for your next visit.  I think this is pretty fantastic!

The food took time to cook, which was nice.  The people working there were friendly and chatted freely amongst themselves and with me while I waited.  I asked questions about the food and they answered them.  They let me know the meats were nitrate free, the crust has a low glycemic index (AMAZING!  You hear that diabetics?  You can have this pizza and not have to worry about blood sugar spikes!), and they use separate cutting utensils for the meat pizzas, vegetarian pizzas, and gluten free pizzas (low risk of cross contamination AND vegetarians don't have to worry about bacon grease on their pizza!)  I mean, they're making a food I felt guilty eating seem less bad, it's almost to the point where I can say, ""Hey, I'm doing something GOOD for me because I'm eating this pizza!""

The pizza came and my kids rejoiced.  The pepperoni on the pizza was so teeny it was cute.  My kids called them baby pepperoni, but make no mistake, they didn't skimp on them!  There was glorious pools of tastiness in the curled up pepperoni that made me envy the metabolism of the young, but that didn't stop me from snagging a slice to try, for thoroughness of my review, of course!

The cheesy breadstixx were glorious!  There was SO MUCH CHEESE on it, and the basil was so tasty.  I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauce, but my kids loved it to dip their crust in (they usually don't eat pizza crust, so score one for Naked Pizza!) 

The Superbiotic pizza is like the veggie special at most pizza places, with the added awesomeness of artichokes, spinach, and garlic.  There wasn't a ton of cheese on it, suffocating the veggie goodness, and those bites of artichoke hearts were fantastic.  You could taste the veggies, they weren't smothered in cheese.  Some may view this as a con, but it's a pro in my book.  Being able to taste the garlic in a pizza is important to me, I LOVE garlic, and I hate when something says there's garlic in it but you can't taste it.  Such a letdown!  The garlic shown through and was noticeable, but not overpowering.

The pepperoni pizza was solid.  It wasn't completely covered in pepperoni like some places (I'm looking at you Papa John's, gross!), hiding their sauce's inadequacies behind pork fat (which in it's defense does cover up many indiscretions in cooking.)  The spices in the sauce are noticeable, the cheese isn't overpowering, and the pepperoni is slightly spicy and delicious.  The edges curled up and got crispy, which I love.

I would definitely recommend Naked Pizza to friends and family.  I really enjoyed the pizza, the employees were helpful and friendly, and it wasn't too expensive, in my opinion.  I can't think of any reason to take a star away.",5.0
"I literally live right around the corner and have been watching this like a hawk waiting to open!  We went around 5:30 on a Saturday night and got seated right away.  We definitely beat the rush as it got really busy after that.
First impressions of the restaurant itself are ...it's a cute, casual place, I think because of the menu and bar I was expecting a bit nicer place but it's ok, we like our casual spots too.
Service was good, especially considering how busy it was, but several of the servers (not ours) seemed very grumpy with their customers.
All the dishes we ordered were good.  The Eggplant Sorrentina was out of this world and it will be hard for me to order anything else off the menu because it was so tasty.  The menu is quite extensive.  Prices are pretty reasonable.  Garlic bread was just ok.
I think the worst offense was the side salad.  When we asked how much it was to add a dinner salad our server told us $2, so when they arrived we were happy with them.  But actually we were charged $4 each and it is not worth it. I really miss the days when the salad was included as part of the meal.  When you're paying $13+ for a big plate of pasta, $4 is absolutely ridiculous for a tiny dinner salad.
But the flavors are great so we will be returning!  Can't wait to see what else they have to offer...just stay away from the side salad unless you like throwing money away.",4.0
"AH-MAAAAA-ZIIING! Came here for my anniversary. I never thought I would ever be lucky enough to see Sir Elton live but a sneaky Bee sure did surprise me.

1. Ticket stub states 7:30 pm. Arrived at 6:45. No cameras. Drinks are around $11 a piece. Worth it as I was hammer-jacked after the second one. By the third I was beyond loadie odie ode and having the time of my life waiting for the lights to go down.

2. Elton and musicians walked out on stage at 7:40 pm. Really? I've never been to a show where it actually starts within a 15 minute window.

3. Nosebleed section and after reading some of the reviews realized that Sir Elton stuck to protocol with opening song (Bennie & The Jets) and banter type jokes.

4. Played for two hours and belted out all the hits:
Bennie
Rocket Man
Someone saved my life tonight
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road
Saturday Night
I Guess that's why they call it blues
I'm still standing (I wish he would have played Mona Lisa instead of this)
Tiny Dancer
Daniel
The Bitch is back
Pinball Wizard
Candle in the wind
Your Song

5. The videos were ok. I loved seeing guest appearances by peeps you will recognize.

There was maybe two songs I didn't recognize.

"A huge disappointment. I have been to almost every venue in Vegas and this one is too large, kids can not even bring in sealed bottled water. Parking is too expensive, especially when the tickets at this arena are already very pricey, parking is 20 at the neighboring garage and sometimes 10 or 12 in advance. I saw people sitting behind the performance stage, which makes no sense at all. Canned beer is $12 and cocktails $18, very pricey. Bottled water is $8 which is just higher than average. There are enough concession stands and they have guys walk the arena selling beer and water. Restrooms were very clean and they certainly had enough people working the door. And make sure that you look at a seating chart before purchasing tixs, They have seats up to the ceiling like Thomas and Mack. I will not be back to T mobile arena unless I desperately have to see a performance.",2.0

"Henderson Nissan is located in Henderson on Auto Show Drive right off of the expressway. They have a large inventory of vehicles and they have a great sales staff.

This place has an excellent service center. I still drive all the way here from Summerlin for service and oil changes just because of the quality of the service you receive as opposed to Auto Nation Nissan on W Sahara, which is much closer to my house.

"DISCLAIMER - This place has 4 star potential but they are having some serious service issues, probably because they have just opened.

Considering they opened last week, they did a good job at rounding up customers. It was a full house tonight. I was surprised. The price point of this sushi joint is moderate and I wasn't sure what the Annex would really think of a slightly more upscale sushi joint.

The main problem was that our order came out staggered and took nearly an hour. I was with 2 others and we each ordered our own rolls. Instead of the food arriving all together, they would bring 1 roll out at a time, about 15 minutes in between each. It made no sense whatsoever. The last roll took so long that we just told the server we didn't want it anymore.

The server could not be found on most occasions, I had to get up twice - once to get soy sauce from another table and a second time to find a clean pair of chopsticks. We couldn't get our tea refilled either until the end of the meal.

Anyway, the good news is, the rolls were all pretty delicious. We tried the butter yaki maki, crunchy maki, sushi couture maki, and green island maki. Portions were small-ish but as the previous reviewer mentions, fish was exceptionally fresh and the rolls came out looking classy. The wasabi was not good and not enough pickled ginger was given.

The server did bring the last roll in a takeaway container for us to have free of charge. I think they are doing their best and I expect service will improve over time.

I expect Sushi Couture will draw the crowd who likes quality fresh stuff and a bit nicer surroundings. But for me, I will revert to Sushi on Bloor or Big Sushi, because I like cheap, copious amounts of sushi.",2.0

Many adaptive re-uses to get to today and a wonderfully comfortable ""little plate"" restaurant where you can dine bench-style and meet strangers if you're so inclined.  It served as a postal credit union and traveling carnival workers union safe house among its prior incarnations...

The chef is an artist and the prices absurdly low.

We stopped in for a light dinner at 9PM on a Saturday night - and were the next in line.  Many of the diners had biked there - the long bike rack was jammed,  Several people after us enjoyed the living room waiting room, others the big screen TV at the bar while awaiting a table.

Three of us - ordered 2 small plates and the sharing special.  It was just enough - any more and we would've been too stuffed.  11 bucks each before tip.

Toasted baguette covering melted brie and walnuts, accompanied by shaved veggie crisps, potatoes and parsnips frites accompanied by mushroom soup [they called it gravy but that implies flour and fat], pork and beef ravioli in a heavenly roasted tomato sauce.

"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile and went yesterday for a special occasion celebration.  There was no one to greet us when we went in, so we sat down at a table in the empty bar and waited for several minutes before a server came into the bar to prepare a bill for one of her tables.  She came back a few minutes later to seat us and apologized for the delay but said they were understaffed for the night.  The service was marginal the entire time we were there, in spite of the restaurant not being full.  The food was good, especially the Dover sole and the chocolate soufflé so the evening wasn't a total disappointment.  When we were leaving, we asked the server to cork our bottle of wine so we could take it with us - to our surprise, they wrapped it in aluminum foil!  Definitely not legal!

"My love affair with BYOBs continues... 

I went here on a date with my man friend on a friday night. Although I am mildly familiar with Mt Wash this place was still hard to find. After we found it and valeted my go-cart we were greeted by a huge party at the door (general mayhem).  I love when restaurants are busy, loud, and hectic (I'm not much for quiet intimate dining). My date made a res which was clutch because this place was packed! 


We sat around 8:50 (our res was at 8:30) but we were in no rush and had fun talking to the large party waiting to sit. We were sat next to another large party this one was already a couple bottles of wine deep when we sat down (more on them later). 

The service was a tad on the slow side but the place was packed. The server Katie was really knowledgeable and funny. My date and I were joking around with her all night. She was also on point with all of the specials. 

We started with special zucchini app. Which was solid, nothing over the top. But a solid dish. I had a spicy shrimp dish and my date had the chicken romano. When they bought these dishes out his looked like a pizza because it was a HUGE portion of lightly breaded chicken in a round shape. Again this PORTION WAS HUGE!!!! It completely covered the plate. Mine was really good, spicy but good! I couldn't finish all of it. 

I think my favorite part of the meal was just the interactions between tables ( I think wine helps this). The large party next to us was a group of 12 65 year olds who went to high school together. They kept chatting with us all night. One guy came over to our table (bombed) and chatted with us for 20 minutes about complete non-sense... hilarious.  Then another table came over making fun of the bombed guy! Generally a lively dinner!

"I have been able to experience both lunch and breakfast at Taylor's Cafe and on both occasions, both service and food were decent. The restaurant is tucked between some small clothing shops, The Eggery, and next to AJ's. The parking is not desirable especially during the lunch hour as the restaurant is sharing the lot with three restaurants and the grocery store.

The restaurant is small with few small tables, shared booth seating, and some outdoor seating. The decor is bright with exaggerated art work of Jazz performers. Apparently, the restaurant used to have some live Jazz music in the past. It is a very cute place.

For lunch, I had one of the chicken sandwiches which was good. However, I thought the options for breakfast were better. You could either choose one of the specialty omelets or build your own. I had the lox omelet which was excellent with hash browns. I was interested in the country potatoes however the waiter had mentioned that other tables had sent back the potatoes and that the hash browns would be better. Still unsure, he let us sample the country potatoes which were decent. I actually liked the country potatoes over the hash browns, I thought it was nice that the server was interested in making sure that we were satisfied. And overall, we all were. My guest ordered a build your own omelet with chorizo and another guest ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and both looked good and were highly complimented. The server was open to providing separate checks (however I am not sure that he would have been so willing if the place was packed which it wasn't). There was a random To-go iced tea delivered to our table and our check had originally not charged for our coffees but then after separation, had charged. These few incidents of confusion were masked by the overall pleasant service, atmosphere and quality of the food. I will definitely be back and would recommend Taylor's as a great breakfast/brunch location.",3.0

"We got there and the AC in the room was on full blast. We soon found out why... After the room warmed up to above meat locker temperatures we discovered the carpet was moist and the the room had a musky mildew smell. We stayed with a large group and several others had the same problem. 

I contacted the front desk who sent maintenance. He confirmed the moist carpet and checked the AC unit and determined that it was not the AC, but could not locate the problem. I then had to go back to the front desk who after 10 minutes said they could move me. The catch was the room was not ready. I waited a few hours and they called me and told me the room ready. You would think problem solved, but this was not the case. I walked down to the front desk and the manager on duty would not give me the keys as are third person was not back to move her stuff. So even though the room was musky and damp they left us their for several more hours. After several hours we moved with help from a bell hop. The bell hop also confirmed several people were complaining about moisture. 

Were now in the new room and most of my clothing smelled like Mildew. I asked them to clean it on my second day of are 4 night stay, but they would not even though their lack of cleanliness caused the problem. Are new room also had a problem with the lock where we had to tug it shut or it would actually hold the door open. Maintenance said they could not fix it and I can live with pulling the door shut tight so I didn't care. 

The night before checkout I still had smelly clothing and was fairly annoyed with the problems, unresponsive staff and general bad attitudes of staff. I had also asked to speak to the general manager several times at this point and they kept putting it off. So the last night I ask the manager on duty to refund my first night since the room was moist and smelled and made my clothing smell like mildew. Refunding one night out of 4 for not providing a clean room seems fair to me. Well the manager on duty did not think so and then all of a sudden after I wanted a refund offered to dry clean my clothing. This was not useful since I was leaving the next morning. 

The best she would offer was half a night. I again asked to speak to the general manager and she said I would be able to in the morning. Then the manager on duty decided to make the claim that maintenance could not find a problem and the carpet was not moist. This upset me the she had the audacity to lie to my face. I was there when maintenance came to the room and found that the carpet was moist. I

The next morning I went down to the front desk and was expecting to talk to the general manager. The general manager was in the room just off to the side of the front desk. One of the staff went in to get her, but she refused to come out and talk to me about the situation. I have never heard of something like that happening. 

I highly suggest staying with something in the HIlton chain instead. Whenever I have had to address a situation with any Hilton chain hotel they fix it. Please for the sake of your health please don't stay here. It deeply concerns me that they were keeping the AC on full blast to deal with it rather than finding and fixing the problem.",1.0
We've been going to this place for years.  Very tasty drinks and food.  And the atmosphere is really great with the decor and exterior patios.  Decorator details will have you looking at every inch of the place.  Once the food arrives you won't be disappointed.  Stuffed quesidillas are always a hit and my husband never deviates from the carne asada.  Downside is that it is always busy so you always have to wait.  But worst part is once seated it is really loud.  You're really packed in so hard to carry on a conversation if you're with a larger party.  Try for patio seating if the weather permits.,4.0
"I personally like this place. They have play areas set up for smaller kids, and everyone here seem to genuinely enjoy the work, and most importantly, are gentle and compassionate. These are not always qualities found in a dentist office. So, hate on the trains all you want, but while hanging around with your mouth open, it gives you something else to stare at besides the hygienist.",4.0
"Finally, an AYCE sushi spot that has variety, fresh sushi, great service, and the whole menu is included. It's a bit of a drive from the strip but worth the trip, especially for their sweet shrimp, Toro, and salmon belly sushi.

"Doctor Romine has helped me enormously. I've seen her for procedures 3-4 times. I had to reschedule at the last minute, and her staff fit me in a few days later with no problem. She is an extremely busy woman because she has so many patients - but this is a sign that she cares. I've never felt pressured to buy products from Camelback Derm, but I've always been given options and information with the ultimate decision being left up to me. She even called me over the weekend to check in on the results of my procedure. I can't speak highly enough about Dr. Romine and my experience at CD.",5.0
"The shaved ice was great! I got blue raspberry and bubble gum (yes, I'm basically a two year old) and it was a huge portion.

"I write this review mostly hoping that the chef will read it and perhaps the ideas here will strike him as useful. I feel this restaurant has the right intentions and potential and would love to see it realized.
The bread was an unfortunate beginning that signalled that the kitchen would not be trying too hard: a bit stale white baguette and another soft bread that could have come out of the supermarket. Mediterra makes lovely sourdoughs and pecan raisin breads (also, see below). Just a small effort and you can showcase ""local"" bread as well.
The cheese plate is full of the right ideas: interesting cheeses, some from Pennsylvania. There is much to like in the selections. But consider the ways the accompaniments would really improve the flavor of the cheese. The night we went, the cheeses were accompanied by hazelnuts, slices of apple and honey, and toasted crostini of the uninspired white baguette we saw earlier in the bread basket. If you want a cheese plate to shine, consider a dense pecan raisin loaf (from Mediterra, say) and a nice fig chutney. These items would be as simple to create but what a difference in taste!
The shishito peppers are always a lovely choice, but these were overcooked (ideally, their skins should not give so easily) and they were on a bed of unnecessary aioli. Why not go Mediterranean instead like the Dinette folks? Pair the peppers with coarse salt and a nice local olive oil (there is a stand at the Public Market that has so many nice selections).
The scallops were nicely cooked but the hard slaw that accompanied them did not add much in the way of flavor. The ""mores"" are a great idea with some tantalizing options. Grilled radicchio does not need a balsamic vinaigrette glaze, because the flavor overpowers its inherent bitterness, and the chickpea puree was watery, rather than garlicky and dense, they way it should taste. 
Finally, the cherry chocolate tempura dessert had, again, a lot of potential. the hot fried, the warm of the chocolate cake paired with the coolness of the ice cream. But look at the dish aesthetically and you see four balls-- three fried chocolate cake and one milk chocolate ball of ice cream, along with more fried slivers. Not only is it not pleasing to the eye, but the ice cream should cut the heaviness of the fried chocolate. Why not pair instead with a nice goat cheese ice cream drizzled with a cherry or other fruit compote?
Finally, a note on the service. Our server was very nice and attentive. But he should not be made to recite a list of ""popular"" dishes. In an upscale restaurant like this, this is an Applebee's move. No diner wants to order what is ""popular."" Instead, there should be a rapport with the server: this is an opportunity for him to talk about what dishes he likes and why they are good. Skip the populist ""popular"" talk for the bloomin' onion.
As I mentioned, my goal is not to trash a place on yelp, but simply to offer suggestions, that should they strike the chef's imagination, may help take a restaurant with good intentions to greater execution.",2.0

"My girlfriend and I being (and becoming) devoted vegetarians, we definitely wanted to try this place, and it did not stay on our list long before we ended up going there.  The outside, as my girlfriend had mentioned in the past, does not look like anything special for sure (it has a dull brown color and is right on the side of a large, fast-moving road.  They do say location is everything, but at the same time, you cannot always be as lucky as you wish to be in picking a spot for your establishment.

Walking into this place, there was a little bit of a weird vibe, but nothing we could not handle (we are all weird in our own ways).  I guess the owner of this place really likes superheroes and such, because there is memorabilia everywhere, on every surface.  Needless to say, it felt pretty weird sitting there with all of the figurines next to us, without much of an explanation from the owner (they could have come around and explained it, and I would have been much more interested).  I am not a stickler for professionalism by any means, but everyone in this place was wearing whatever they wanted to, and our server had the brightest white frames on his glasses, making it hard to really take much of the experience seriously.

For the fact that there were not many tables in this establishment, I thought that the service was relatively slow (contrary to when I had called a couple of weeks before and the person on the other end of the phone had said that they turn over tables pretty quickly).  Again, there was ample time for someone to come by and explain the place, its mission, why it looked the way it looked, etc.  I am pretty sure that I saw (who I thought was) the owner talking to a bunch of other parties, but we hardly saw him.  The server seemed a little delayed when we ordered the food, like he was unsure of what we were ordering or something.

We had a priority, which was figuring out what did and did not have nuts in it, for my girlfriend is allergic to them, and that would have instantly been a deal-breaker.  First, our server did not have much to say about it, and suggested we just order and go from there (not the worst suggestion ever, as it is what I may say where I work as well).  Who we thought to be the owner also came over, but his help was even less reassuring (""yeah guys, we do use peanuts..."" not ""how can I make sure you enjoy my business as well as everyone else?"").

The food we ended up ordering was pretty great, I wold have to say.  For being vegan, it is pretty impressive that they could pull off a flavorful cowboy burger, barbecue chicken fingers, and fried pickles (although they left a lot to be desired, and the portion was HUGE).  The food was exactly how it looked on the website, which was helpful and satisfying, and the taste really was great.

In being consistent with the rest of the reviews I have done, I have given this establishment this rating based mostly upon their food quality, but there is much to be said about the service.  It definitely made the mood difficult to explain at best.  I am also attributing at least some of the mood to the fact that we may have been in a little bit of a sour mood while we were there.  Thus, I have tried to be as objective as possible in writing this review, but I do not know if we will be going back.  Although we ordered a lot to try (exactly how I wanted it), the food definitely costs a fair amount, and I cannot say right now if it is worth it for us to return.",3.0

"My second or third time here. The waiting time is a bit long like 15 min for a small drumstick with sweet and spicy sauce. I also had taro milk tea and french fries as sides.
The sauce is light spicy which hits me right, but overpowering sweet, french fries a bit too salty. taro milk tea has as always too much tapioca that I cannot finish nor reach.
The cashier is friendly. Two stars off for the mediocre chicken and fries and waiting time.

Lesson for myself, good milk tea, but no need of tapioca it's a waste, unless I really crave them.",3.0

"I prefer shopping at the Ulta location. I like the way the store is set up. If I need help there is someone there but they are not pushy. I prefer shopping on my own.

My daughter had a makeup lesson for $30 plus tip.
The gal who helped her would show her on one side and then let her try to apply on the other side. She did great! 

Today they just had one girl working the counter. Her customer was taking an extremely long time. The line was backed up, all the way down the other side of the isle! I had to ask her to call another cashier. She should have done this herself. 

Thank goodness someone came to help BC we were all getting annoyed. 

I wish they had sales.  The stuff they periodically put out on a shelf is mostly crap. Stuff most ppl wouldn't want.  

You can almost always find a $3.50 off coupon in the mail and occasionally a 20% off coupon.

 I do like their rewards program. For every $100  you spend you get $3 off any item in the store. I let mine accumulate. Plus through out the year you get emails with special double and/or triple point items. 

 Exclusive one day sales on a particular item, for example recently the IT Cosmetics palette
was half off.  Emails with offers such as buy xyz and get this 30pc gift set free.

"This is easily the best sushi place on bloor street to have rolls. People will try to convince you otherwise.
Sadly, this place is always packed, and the tables are placed ridiculously close together. 
When I use to go Downtown often I would usually drop by at least 3 times a week, and I would always have to wait for a bit for a table around dinner time... trust me its the same for any day you come in even on a weekday night. I would recommend this place for take out, and lunch if you are looking for a quick meal. Not a comfortable place to eat in i must admit its just too crowded. 
Also, if you are into sashimi this is not the place trust me but this is the place for sushi #1 pick in my books :).",3.0

"THE WORST SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
In advance of the installation of all new irrigation in our yard, I ordered several thousand dollars of landscaping, paying for delivery and planting, setting it all up for Sept. 8th.  On Sept. 7th, Labor Day, Moon Valley's driver calls to say he is on the way.  Wrong day so he was turned away at our guard gate.  Then, instead of showing up the next day, after 1 pm as promised, they showed up at 11:45 am and we were not home until 12:30.  So then they tell me they can't come until Friday.  

Friday- plants delivered and installed but 6 large shrubs are missing!  ""We haven't had boxwoods for weeks so I don't know why your salesman sold them to you.""  But, he promised me they would bring them out within a few days and get them planted.  When I explained that the irrigation would be in by then I was assured Moon Valley would add the drips required.  

One week and three unreturned calls later, plants are delivered.  The installers tried to charge me $10 per plant and then dug into my pool pipes resulting in water shooting around the yard.  Oops!  Shrugs and laughter and advice to ""call your pool guy, I guess"".  Who will pay for that? Additionally they left without planting one shrub and cutting another one in half with their shovel.  

That all happened on Sept. 22nd.  I was finally told to send photos, which I did, and they would be here to make everything right on Wed. Sept. 23rd.  Suffice it to say that I have spoken to many many people at Moon Valley since then, all promising their ""professional landscape team"" would be here to fix things soon.  While out-of-town this weekend I spent hours following up to ensure our pool and yard were fixed.  Saturday morning I received a text message from their Customer Service manager telling me the work was done, pool all fixed, plants planted, mess cleaned up, and that the manager was going out once again to check water levels.  Whew, finally.  Or so I believed.

Today, Sept. 23rd, we just got home from the airport to find one guy in our flooded yard working on our now half empty pool.  He said he was just contacted today by Moon Valley.  Seriously?  Not one thing was done!  Our pool is full of dirt, plants are dead or damaged, and I am beyond angry at having been repeatedly lied to.  

Everyone there is, of course, ""terribly upset"" that these incidents occurred and, guess what?  A manager ""will be here tomorrow to make it all right"".   Really?

If you are thinking of doing any business with this company I urge you to walk the other way as fast as you can.  They don't deserve my business or yours. 

Update on 10/2:
Today a Moon Valley replaced the plants that were flooded and restored our yard to what it should be.  Thanks to Jason, the manager who this finally got escalated to for resolution.  Jason is the person I wish we had dealt with weeks ago but I'm now happy with the outcome.",1.0

"I really hate to leave a bad review, but any bride interested in this venue needs to know what to expect.

The venue itself is beautiful. When the weather is nice, as it was on our wedding day, artificial lighting does not need to be used. I was pleased that our photographer could shoot our ceremony in natural light! The building is old and beautiful.

Cindy, the manager, I found to be difficult to work with. She will not answer the office phone for the chapel. The best way to contact her is through the chapel email address; however, expect to wait a few days for an answer!

I dialogued via email with Cindy in November 2014, hoping to book the place for our March 2015 wedding. Her husband, Steve, who served as our sound technician, was professional and friendly as he showed us the venue when we visited.

I emailed Cindy immediately after visiting and told her I would be sending in my contract immediately, which I posted the next day. My envelope included the check, the contract, and an itemized list of expenses to explain the check amount. We paid to book the place ($400), for the sound technician ($100), and for two extra hours of chapel use ($200).

In January, once I had already sent out the invitations, I emailed Cindy about some wedding decor details (a pew count in particular, so I could buy the appropriate number of bows). She chose to inform me that she had never received my check and contract. I frantically tried to contact her via phone and email, desperate to know if my date was still safe. I spent a sleepless night worrying that I would need to start the venue search over again. I did not hear from her until the following evening; she told me my date was safe and she was searching for my contract. The day after, she emailed me to tell me that my envelope had been in the chapel mailbox the whole time.

Who doesn't check the mailbox for two months, especially when I had emailed her to say it was coming?!?!? 

Also, I emailed her multiple times for a pew count. I ended up visiting again and counting for myself.

In the end, the ceremony went without a hitch. The chapel was opened on time and Steve did a great job with our sound.

After the ceremony, Steve approached my parents for payment. Cindy did not apparently inform her husband that his amount was included in the check (as indicated by my itemized list of expenses included with the check).

In conclusion, fellow brides, be aware of the struggles you are likely to face in communicating with Cindy if you choose this beautiful venue.",3.0

"Best beer selection EVER.

I met up with a girlfriend for dinner and drinks last night.  She suggested The Rhino because it was apparently *the* place to go for beer.  I am the first to admit I am a bit of a beer snob and I immediately flipped the menu to the German beer section.  My eyes anxiously scanned the lengthily list for my coveted Festbock (dark with 7% alchohol), and I think I may actually have let out a yelp when there it was printed in bold black ink.  **For those of you who don't know me Festbock is the liquid love of my life, I would happily replace all other fluids  in my fridge  if it wasn't so darn unhealthy and didn't lead to alcoholism.  Just a couple of these 500mL cans and I'm the happiest girl alive, or at least for a couple of hours.

Besides all that, The Rhino really does have an amazing beer selection and is the true watering hole of beers.

The establishment is huge although I think the space could be better utilized to fit more tables and chairs.  The staff were friendly enough without being fake or annoying, or on the other end of the spectrum, aloof. The restaurant, cutlery and bathroom seemed to be clean and free from offensive odors.

We ordered a couple of drinks each and split the grilled calamari and a pizza.  The food was good (I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to pub-style) and we were pleasantly surprised when the bill slid in at under $35 before gratuity.  And that was for both of us!

"Pros:
-Affordable price
-Convenient location on the strip
-Lots of places to eat and shop at Miracle Mile Shops. There are a lot of affordable food options here...Pin-Up Pizza, Earl of Sandwich, Pink's, La Salsa Cantina (breakfast).
-Free wifi (only on two devices)

Cons:
-Self service parking. It is SO far away from the rooms. Way too long of a walk, especially when you are carrying a bunch of bags full of alcohol, water, shoes, etc. Do valet parking instead. Apparently it's free.
-The line to check in was ridiculously long. There should have been more than 3 people working at the front desk on Thanksgiving.
-Pillows are extremely uncomfortable.
-Towels are really thin and not very soft.

One other thing. We were walking back to the elevators to get to our room around 2am. There was a guy completely passed out, face planted into the floor in the corner. A staff member walked right past him and didn't do anything! He didn't call anyone to help the guy out. He didn't try to wake him up. Horrible! I walked to the lobby and made sure one of the people at the front desk called security. I understand that I'm sure they see this kind of thing a lot with people being drunk and all that.

The overall flavor of the burger lacked seasoning, and the bun was soggy by the time we got home. The chicken was also pretty dry. It was not to our expectations. We've been to skinny fats many times before and haven't been disappointed.",3.0
"It was daddy and daughter day. So I decided to bring her here since she loves cheeseburgers! We both had a cheeseburger w/potato salad. NOTE: They do not serve fries!!!! Service is a little slow, but we received our order very fast. We both enjoyed our burgers very much! Very juicy, and cooked perfect! I really liked the potato salad, the daughter is very hard to please! She liked the potato's but she had to pick through the rest of the ingredients! She was ecstatic about being able to create her own shake! She ordered a banana and cheesecake shake, she usually only eat part of it and give the rest away! I was lucky enough to at least try it before she consumed the whole thing!!! Very tasty! I had their fresh lemonade, this was probably the best lemonade I have ever had!!! We really enjoyed this place and definitely will bring mama here.",4.0
"We came here on a Saturday after leaving the farmers market.  The store its self is retro, but dirty retro.  Everything was so cluttered and dusty it made me want to leave, but we stayed.  All we wanted was a milkshake...they are a soda fountain!  The servers were clueless, took about 15 minutes for someone to help us and we were the only ones in the restaurant!  This was disappointing.  We each ordered a shake, they all came out at different times.  The serve made one, brought it out and so on.  This is a HUGE irritant to me...I do not want to eat/drink while others watch me.  The shakes were good, but nothing to write home about.  

I think overall, I will try another place before I came back here.  Disappointing...",2.0
"Walked into the place expecting with my lawyer a 65 year old woman of class.  We were dressed in professional business attire.  The greeter does not greet and tells us to find our own table when all the tables were filled.  Finally we got a table the server barely said hello, I mean Mcdonalds next greets you with a bigger smile for 99 cents.  In addition to that the burger came they were Ok but served luke warm and seemed like they had been sitting around.  This is for a 14 dollar burger.  I fairness I did return to this place by myself to grab a bite and had virtually the same repeat experience.  No hospitality, a bunch of grown men upset that they are stuck serving burgers well guess what that is not the customer fault LOL.  Anyway again COLD burgers and the cold shoulder from the staff.

"My parents and I saw Terry Fator a few years ago and really enjoyed it. So much that this year, we took my husband and best friend as well. I was pretty disappointed, as now it's obvious that Terry has a platform and is determined to use it. 

First off, the ventriloquism is great. It's truly impressive that he can sing as well as he does without moving his lips. The jokes are about 70% funny, some very funny and some a bit lame. I enjoy the singing and impressions immensely. If the show was just these things, I'd give 4 or 5 stars to the performance. 

Now...the one star. Terry now includes three original songs in his show. The first song, a country number, okay, not good, but at least lively. During the middle of the show, Terry launches into preachy sermon time. The song about Horses in Heaven was just a terrible song on its own. But also, the mood was completely dampened by the story about kids with cancer. Seriously? I felt duped and my sense of fairness was outraged. We bought tickets for a funny ventriloquism show, and now I'm being preached at? This segment lasted a long time, and continued with a celebration of the military (fine) and another cheesy, badly written song.  Definitely a damper on the mood. I give this part 1 star, so it evens out to 3 stars. 

Too bad. We won't be going back.",3.0

"The food was tasty, but rather expensive. I got a bacon cheeseburger and the meat was flavorful, but small....didn't even fill the bun.

I would have given a higher review but the atmosphere/experience wasn't great. We were the only ones there but the tables were dirty. 3 younger guys were working but they didn't care much about their job, they seemed as if they just wanted to hangout in the back. They could have spent some of that time taking care of the place. Windows were dirty, walls looked like they had food on them, vents haven't been dusted in ages(even the within reach vents on the soda fridge) and the 2 month old posters for Frozen on Ice could be removed.

Would I return again? I wouldn't drive any great distance to come here again. With the quality of food that I had, it could be a nice place if someone took a little pride in the place.",2.0
"Saturday night dinner, first timer at Montana's. Expectations were high based on the higher steak prices (about 50-70% higher than the chain steakhouses Outback, Longhorn etc).
Service was below average for this price range, not attentive, burger joint caliber. No bread or butter on the table. They serve your salad dressing in a small container on the side, even for a Caesar's salad. The container does not contain enough dressing, asked for a little more and the server said Upcharge! The upcharge was 25 cents, they really need that quarter! Wife had the Shrimp and scallop alfredo linguine. It was tasty but they sliced the whole scallops into 1/8 to 1/4"" slices to have the appearance of ""more""!. My 10 0z Baseball cut Sirloin at 27 bucks was on the tough side even at medium rare, the side of squash casserole was dry, and luke warm to cool in temperature. Wife asked to box her remaining dinner, server plopped a styrofoam box on the table. The chains do a much better job at around $15 bucks for a 10 oz sirloin. Wine list was fairly reasonable. Montana's steak prices range from $27 to $48, very high for the lackluster meal and service. No reason to return, going back to Longhorn or Outback for our next steak fix!",1.0
"What a fun experience! I highly recommend it to anybody over the age of 8 or so.
First of all, the ambiance is super cool. Is this what it's like in Japan? Not sure, but I like to think so. It's a small room decorated all in white, with about 10 seats at the 'bar' where you can watch a few of the desserts being made, and about 10 table seats. Warning: there is no signage! It's located between Kabuto and a massage place.
The food menu (which is edible!), includes a 3-course prix fixe option or a 1-course option. The drink menu has an extensive selection of champagne and dessert wines, but unfortunately, these are all quite high-priced and there are very few by the glass selections. In addition, you can order from a wide variety of teas and several types of bottled Japanese water of various ph's. We tried the 'bicarbonate' one, which is supposedly for athletes. I could taste a slight difference from the tap water, but I'm not sure if it was worth $4!
On to the main thing, the desserts! They were all delicious. Our amuse was a white peach sorbet with sparkling wine jelly and it was sooo good. Usually peach-flavored things are cloyingly sweet, but this was so light and delicious! The small beads of sparkling wine jelly perfectly complemented it. I could have eaten about 10 of these.
For our 'main' dish we had the 'angel' (cookie with pear gel on top and covered with a pear foam) and the 'red rock' (raspberry molten cake with vanilla ice cream and yuzu marshmallows and some other stuff!). The angel was really good - light, with just a hint of pear - but the red rock was awesome! Seriously, I usually don't like 'molten' cakes because they're goopy and too sweet and the cake part is heavy, but THIS.....this was so good. And of all things, the yuzu marshmallows really stood out! It was disappointing that we only had 2! Our last dish was the cream puff. It was good and all, but small, and nothing too special.
I would highly recommend everybody check out Sweets Raku at least once - it's a perfect date night! Add a bottle of dessert wine and you could even skip dinner! At $19 for the prix fixe menu, it's definitely more than you'd spend on typical dessert, but it's perfect for a special occasion.
So why, you may ask, do I not give it 5 stars? Simply because it is waaayyyyy......toooooooo.....slllllloooowwww. Seriously, we were there over an hour! I appreciate that every dish is made by hand as it's ordered, but could you maybe hire another cook back there? At a pace like that, it's not really even good for kids. Ours held out to the end, but we ended up scarfing down the cream puff in 1 bite each since it was way past bedtime by that time.",4.0

"I got to go Vegas on my 21st b-day. Woot Woot. This place was the first stop when we got to Vegas after checking in and stuff. It was quite classy. There were so many people. They have a restaurant downstairs and a nightclub upstairs. The food was alright but it was real expensive.

The nightclub was crazy. If you like getting tight and being touched by others. This club would be the place. There was SO MUCH people. People squeeze in so close to dance. They were quite touchy too. I hated one thing, and it was that they allow people to smoke in there. It really annoyed me.

Oh yea, the restroom was confusing. They only had ""ying"" and ""yang"" labeled on the restroom doors. My friend and I didn't know which was female. Then this group of girls also was clueless, then some of them opened one of the doors and found it was the women side. Then one girl opened the male side and then came back out. My friend then told me later, there was statue by the door to determine if its the male or female side because they were naked. I cracked up when I saw it.",3.0
"Hate hate hate... the only reason it gets 2 stars is cause Caesar at the door was cool enough to let us in though my boyfriend and I were late for our 'group of 20'... afterwards I wished he hadn't and we'd have run off to some other venue.

Once we got in (after paying 30$ though we weren't supposed to), it was wall-to-wall people... 2 house vodka cranberries were 24$ before tip and... did I mention you couldn't move, let alone dance?  Not cool.  

Won't see ya there.",2.0
"My hair still smells like cigarettes from last night as I type this. (well, it did when I started the review last week!)  Now, onto the review!

So a friend of a friend, who works for Tao group, was giving us the hookup when she invited us out to Tao with her Dec. 2 (Thursday.) We got in free with the VIP stamp, and just walked right in with her, and we had full access to an open bar. Who can complain about free everything?! I'm a fan of free!

We got in about 10:15 PM and immediately headed upstairs with the three other girls I was with. The girls that lay by the staircase weren't out and neither were the bathtub bathers - which for me, is a-okay. We went to the bar for our gratis drinks; I happened to have a very tasty amaretto sour (the only mixed drink I like) sans a marachino cherry. Thank you Tao for saving me $11!

The dance floors were deserted in the main room and we sorta just walked around and hung out on the balcony for a little bit before dancing for maybe 30 minutes. We were approached by some girls taking pictures of guests who they had given Holly Madison's new Hypnotique shots (gawd, Hypnotique is gross) so we did that, and then they came back and wanted a second shot, so I posed and gave them back the shot - I like being sober. 

After that, we headed to the lounge room (whatever the smaller dance floor is upstairs is called.) There was maybe 6 girls just dancing around (one was way drunk.) Luckily, some guys made it to the dance floor - oh wait, no, only one did, and he was dancing with me. Ha. After about 20 minutes some more guys showed up and the floor started getting filled up. 

Some guys I had noticed earlier were now in the lounge and one of them got stuck on me. Oh lordy, he had on Crafters (those rectangle glasses featured in every freakin' Lens Crafters ads) and so I got separated from my group and just chilled with him on the balcony after wading through the crowd gaping, with cellphones raised, at Holly Madison, who was hanging out at a private table (have these people never seen a prostitute before? It's Vegas...)

The balcony is really nice, and the bouncers make sure it doesn't get too busy. It's really the only place you can have a conversation and truly hear what the other person is saying. When this guy was telling me how he charged $2,000 to a 40% interest credit card to come on this vacation, I was literally already in the process of walking away but alas, it was a joke -  if I had been inside the club, I wouldn't have heard the ""it's a joke"" part and the night would have ended very differently (which would have been good for me and bad for him.)

Let me just say that I'm not Bobby Brackins; I'm not lookin' for some love in the club. I have no desire to hook up with random fools on vacation looking to bump or get as close as possible to doing such, but you will find a ton of that in this club - either in business suits (tons of business men) or So Cal Asian cool kids. 

After hanging out on the balcony, this guy, Mike (the one with the Crafters) was really pressuring me to go back to his suite with him because he saw (from reading a text message over my shoulder) that my friends had gone home after not being able to locate me. I held out and we went back to his table he bought with his suite mates. Um, yeah, I wouldn't spend that sort of ridiculous money for a table, but if you want to dance without being in a cattle car, find a guy with a table. The velvet ropes keep the drunk wild dancers out, and there is room to breathe. There are a zillion attendants making sure the table drinks and condiments are filled. There is a huge Kentucky Derby-like cup that holds ice. After being offered a drink from the table, and me declining, I was told to at least have something, so I took an ice cube. Ha. Not bad.

Mike was dead set on us ""taking a walk around the shops;"" out of towner club guy translation: ""let's go to my suite."" (There will be a review about this. Don't worry, I didn't do anything! Bleh!) so I relented and we walked out of the club. On the way out, I got some snazzy (yet too small) flip flops. These are the real deal, not some cheap-o pair.  Nice!

Overall, Tao is great when stuff is free and you don't have to wait in line. I don't know if I would have had a nice time if I had to wait in line and pay like everybody else, but my experience was pretty fun!",4.0

"I've visited the Scottsdale location a few years ago and swore I would not go back to another Lo Lo's however I decided to give the Gilbert location a try since everyone was raving about this new location. 

The service was great! Nick, our server was very attentive and refilled drinks on time. Granted, it wasn't very busy and many of the waiters stood around and acted busy. 

Food was brought out on time. Too fast, actually. The grits were not cheesy, nor savory and not worth the extra price. Collard greens was lacking the ""soul food"" flavor I was looking for and definitely not worth the $5. The chicken thighs were okay and the waffle a bit soggy. I think they over butter everything to make up for the lack in flavor. This place was a bit pricey. Spent about 46 dollars for two people to dine. I probably won't be back.",3.0
"I'm sorry to see others had a bad experience.  I always feel you should give  a place at least a month to work out all the quirks.  We had to wait about 45 minutes.

As we were all leaving, behind the establishment, some guy with bright pants told us to be sure to come back.  Absolutely we will.  Friendly service like that, you can count on it.

"Delicious Mexican food and strip club next door...how can you go wrong?! It's open all night too which is a plus for those not in the mood for Roberto's to get that late night Mexican fix. I've been a few times and the service has always been wonderful. The salsa is super yummy. Recently, I had the al pastor tacos which were just like off the streets of Mexico (authentic but definitely more pricey). It's super dark inside but hey...there's no need for good lighting in a Mexican restaurant next door to a strip club. Again...pricey for Mexican food but definitely delicious.",5.0
I've been coming here for months and this is long over due. Any local knows that the best places are often off the strip and this is no different. As far as Mexican cuisine there is not a place I've been to that is better. Chef Paco has created a menu that everyone can enjoy while still capturing the true flavors of Central American cooking. Counting in the prices and the specials that they run it's a no brainer. The ingredients for every dish are from premium organic sources and prepared by people that care. Anyone who works in the service industry will tell you some people are impossible to please and those kinds of people should just stay home..forever. Forget those grumps. If you have any common sense along with an appetite to match you better be stopping by here asap. Plus it's open 24/7. Skip the late night street meat that might give you botulism. El Dorado is a real slice of Mexican pride.,5.0
"Oh Zink you've let me down. I'm really disappointed with my latest foray here. The decor is still very nice and upscale and the service is still friendly, but what the heck has happened to the food?!

We ended up here after driving around for about an hour looking for a place that didn't have a two hour wait and I've had good experiences here before so I was sure it'd be a nice night out when the hostess said she could seat us right away. Man was I wrong. We started with the Lobster Mac & Cheese. The cheesiest thing about the dish was the ritz cracker crust on top. I realize that sounds very sad, that's because it is. The lobster was great on it's own and there were decent chunks throughout the dish. The mac part though? It really could've just said lobster with pasta in a cream sauce and I probably would've believed them. Not very cheesy and kind of runny instead of a glorious gooey concoction I was hoping for. I finished it off though and good thing too because I ordered the wagyu burger and I managed about 2-3 bites before I gave up due to how hard it was to eat combined with how flavorless and dry the meat was. That thing tasted like pure disappoint if disappointment had a taste. I ended up eating some of my dining partner's pulled pork ravioli, and dipping my fries in the sauce.

Our waiter was friendly if a little slow on taking orders and water refills. Pacing of the meal was spot on, the appetizers came out shortly after our order was filled and entrees came shortly afterwards I like that they pay attention to timing. However I gotta say he was really turning a blind eye to customer satisfaction. He saw that I didn't like or eat my burger, and didn't want to take it home, and I even said out loud when he was clearing the table ""What a disappointment"" and he just went on merrily clearing plates returning a short time later to see if we wanted dessert. No thanks I'd just like to leave and go get a burger at cookout so I can stop being hungry.

This has left a very bad impression on my friend and I find myself hard pressed to make a return trip here now after this experience. I am sad that I pretty much ate a $14 piece of pickle and fries for dinner. So two stars means Meh. I've experienced better. You know where I've experienced better? From the same place.",2.0

I recently had jaw surgery so was looking forward to one of my first meals, and wanted to check this place out.  The girl up front took my order wrong, I said I wanted 1 Medium Carne asada Burrito (really small), 2 cabeza tacos and 1 pastor.  When I opened the food up there was 1 Burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  So no cabeza and no pastor which I really wanted to try both of them; so was really disappointed because it wanted it to be a special meal.  I can really honestly say that I can make better tacos at home with better presentation and of course the meats I like.  Hopefully they can work the kinks and make themselves better!",2.0
"I never liked ping pong in my basement - I'm not sure why I like it so much here.  There is something very social about the environment and the sport that work well here.  The space is huge and I love not having to chase down balls - they have people who pluck them up and put them back into a basket beside your table.  I'd come more regularly but the price of the tables seems a bit steep - close to $250 for 2 hours / 2 tables on a Saturday afternoon.  As a result, it tends to be more of large group activity as playing is a bit of a novelty.",4.0

I made few calls, and went back to pick her up.
I paid and saw the receipt. It was around $45 Extra for her medicines.

We make a point to eat at Metro once or twice a month.",4.0
"Coup Des Tartes has been a family favorite for years!  The dinner we enjoyed tonight was nothing short of excellent!

Andrea was wonderful!  She had great energy and really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and well attended to.  My family hadn't been to the new location, and she offered to take us on a tour and gave us the history of the building - which was a treat!  

Every course was perfection!  From the shrimp filled calamari, filet with truffle macaroni and cheese, and creme brûlée to top it off!  The courses were also well spaced out and arrived just in time.

We can't wait to come back!  Thanks so much for another memorable experience!",5.0

"Eh it was just alright. My room mate was DYING for some pulled pork. Everywhere we really wanted to try was closed on Sundays. So we got a Yelp deal $10 for $20 worth of food and got a 3 meat combo--brisket, rib tips, and the aforementioned pulled pork. Brisket was sliced super thin, like WTF. Rib tips were ok but very small amount. The pulled pork was mushy and soft yet dry at the same time. I liked the sauce, slightly spicy, but they didn't put much, and didn't give extra in our takeout box.

The mac and cheese was bland. The baked beans tasted like Bush's from the can. Plus they forgot our cornbread (which wasn't sweet at all) and had to go back in and ask for it. Overall, barely worth the $10 let alone the $20 for regular price.

Go to John Mull's in the NW instead, and get way WAY more food that's way WAY better for a couple bucks less.",2.0
"Food was good. The cook brought us out the food after waiting for about 30 min for 2 meals. He refilled our drinks also because after the waitress( younger African American woman) took our order she Never once came back to inquire about drinks or food.  And we were the only couple of people there. Not sure if it was because i told her we were using a Groupon or not. But when i asked questions about how something on menu tasted, she replied ""like its supposed to taste"".

"I have been a frequent visitor of CupKates for about 3 years! For not only cupcakes (full size and mini) and delicious Cakepops we also frequent her shop for trinkets and all things shiny for my little girl! We use CupKates for mostly custom orders and Kate is such a dessert design genius I am able to give her a rough idea of what I would like and let her run with it. She never stops impressing me with her ideas. My little girl had her birthday party there last year and when I say a tea party fit for a princess that's exactly what it was. We will always go out of our way to support the small business/local business. It is not your typical bakery so don't go there expecting to see cases of dozens and dozens of cupcakes. She keeps minis and Cakepops on site fresh. They are perfect for a snack and when you fall in love with her goodies, order yourself a custom order for s treat! Thanks Kate (and your super friendly brother who I am blanking on his name) for always being so friendly and amazing!!",5.0

"Very quiet, low-key atmosphere (no music). If you're looking for a high-energy, buzzin' joint, this is not it. You would definitely come here for the food, not the experience. I stopped by on a weekday evening to meet a couple of friends. We were the only customers for the almost 2 hours we were there. It was a little warm for my liking but I know we're in the middle of summer & some places have a hard time cooling down. I think pricing was average for the amount & quality of food. They didn't skimp on portions! It also came out quickly & was really tasty! I got their Nagasaki Sara Udon which comes with 2 Inari Sushi. I had way more than enough for leftovers the next day. Surprisingly the Inari Sushi was kind of the highlight! Can I order 10 of those & just stuff my face until I'm fat & happy?? I'd love to come back & try some of their family style sushi dishes!",4.0
"So I finally found some time to try the much praised Slider Truck.  Almost missed the  truck since I was expecting a large crowd, but thank goodness I caught a glimpse of it and there were no crowds!

The guys behind the counter were super friendly.  They were happy to help out with suggestions.  I ordered the Pep, Captain's, Caprese, and Yaya.   Unfortunately they had run out of the pulled pork.  I also got an order of my favorite sweet potato fries.  My sliders came first 'cause the cook forgot about my fires, but no worries since that just meant my fires were nice and hot!

When I finally got to try these mythical mini-burgers, I was definitely not disappointed!  They were tastey, so much so I literally inhaled the first three.  Seriously, I forgot how to chew, the sliders were that good.

The caprese was the most forgettable of the four, still very good though.  The Pep and Captain's were similar, both were very fresh, with the greens and tomatoes coming through.  The super sauce on the Pep came through nicely, while the feta on the Captain's was a nice addition to the texture.  My favorite however, was the Yaya.  For whatever reason, maybe because I slowed down and chewed, all the flavors worked well together.  The nice, hot and fresh sweet potato fries smelled incredible.  Sweet potato with a hint of cinnamon.  It was more of a dessert than a side!

My only regrets after my first visit to the Slider Truck, was that I did not order in multiples of three, since that is the most bang for your buck and they were out of the Porkie sandwich!  Other than that, it was a great experience: good food, friendly non-pretentious service, super casual atomosphere.",5.0

"In a nutshell, Escobar is a gem.  A casual little place in an admittedly uninspiring small strip mall, and from the outside you'd never know what deliciousness awaits you.  It's run by a local family, and the mom & pop vibe is evident in both service and sustenance.  The menu isn't extensive, which I like- unpretentious and positively delicious dishes prepared with love and taste like an practiced Mexican grandma labored in the kitchen to present you with an incredible, authentic family meal (rather than cheddar melted over canned refried beans!).  The prices are reasonable, it's kid-friendly, every dish I've had is scrumptious, and the icing on the cake is that their margaritas are extraordinary!",5.0
"Sushiholic is a solid sushi spot for the Arcadia area. It is right across the street from my office, so it has become a staple in my weekly food adventures.

I really love their happy hour- they have great deals on sushi rolls, raw sushi, and even other food! I met my boyfriend here for lunch a few weeks ago and he got a combination box. There was so much food in there- chicken, rice, salad, cream cheese wontons, an orange! I can't believe how much food you get for the price!

I have had their raw tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. All were excellent. They also do take-out very efficiently and fast. Every time I have called an order to-go I get it super quick within fifteen minutes! Woohoo!

If you like raw fish, you will definitely like their sushi. If you want to grab a bite with someone who isn't a raw fish connoisseur then bring them here- they have plenty of other tasty options as well!",4.0
"SushiHolic ADDICT I am!!

Simply delicious & the staff are sweet (they get to know you by name)!  

They had a special of live raw shrimp that was beautifully prepared & soooooo sweet!!  Made me JUMP when they pre-showed me the shrimp when it moved within the water lol. Ohhhhhh oooooops was yummy!

Freshly made ceviche SPECIAL (will depend on freshness & availability). Only made by Chef Felipe & not on menu but should be!!  OMG YUMMINESS & freakin' delish!!!

Tempura udon has a great broth & actually all their dishes have great sauces. Squid & the cucumber salad were both very nice!  Galbi & their fried rice reminded me of my mom's!!

They have awesome lunch specials!!  Great happy hour pricing & slightly different reverse happy hour pricing right after HH til closing. 

Also, they will accommodate special requests: like extra spicy mmmmmmmmmm.  

One of my new faves & Asian craving within walking distance!!  Woohoo!!

"Authentic noodles derailed with a blanket of oil. 

For dinner the lady and I decided to check out this place and their hand made noodles. I ordered the eggplant chicken and she ordered the tofu chicken, both with knife cut noodles and the beef pancakes on the side. 

Pros: Amazing noodles! 

Cons: Both dishes were drenched with oil, especially the tofu chicken; Eggplant chicken literally had only 4 small pieces of eggplant and a majority of green and red peppers (dish should be called bell pepper chicken instead); both dishes were salty (we probably drank 2L of water); did I say the dishes were oily (you could feel a film in your mouth after drinking water). 

Overall impression: 2.5 stars. Only dine here if your primary physician permits.",3.0

"SEATING RECOMMENDATION BELOW...

Definitely the top Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas! Having already seen Mystere, I wanted to make O my second Cirq show to see how it compared. Well, I wasn't disappointed. O exceeded my expectations and beyond. It's a great show, family friendly, and visually spectacular. The show leaves you wondering what you just watched, it's so wam bam and in your face artistic beauty. 

The show runs 90 mins from start to finish and you'll want to come about 15-20 mins early to get thru the ticketing line and to your seats. The show isn't like some of the other Cirq shows, there's little audience involvement. Although it seems like they're picking random people, the people they're picking are clearly planted in the audience.

My SEATING RECOMMENDATION is to not sit close to the stage. In fact, the closer you are the worse your seats will be... because if you're too close you'll be straining your neck the entire show looking up and won't be able to see the entire stage. The best seats are in the 200s, upper orchestra section,  closest to center as possible. The lower orchestra towards the back isn't bad either. Stay away from too close and too far (balcony is pretty far and things will seem a little small). 

Overall, O is a spectacular show. Whether it's your first O show or you've seen others, you won't be disappointed in O at the Bellagio!!!",5.0
"O yeah. This was my first Vegas show and it was amazing. I loved every second of it.

Seats: Section 103, F 6/7. Damn. Great. Seats. (But that's just my opinion. I could see how being a few rows back to see a bit more of the stage as a whole would be better for some people.)

Price: yeah, expensive...but that's why you should be a MLife players club member and get that shiz 2-for-1 and stop your bitchin'!

It's so different seeing these kind of acrobatics and aerial stunts in person. How can somebody's body do that? It is truly impressive. Everything was really beautiful.

My only complaint is that I didn't have more pairs of eyeballs to take everything in. I guess this just means that I'll have to see it again!",5.0

"Great food if you don't go after 2pm. We have been there several times lately after 2 and their lunch specials end at 3. Our food has not been warm enough and the cooks in the back come out shortly with large servings of food for 2 people in the back and the lady in the front. When they sit down to eat, they ignore if you need any thing and act when you need your bill that you shouldn't bother them.  If we can't go before 2, we will go another place in the area. I will say their food is great when it's hot and you get great a plate that's full of food.",3.0

"While out and about early on a Sunday looking for a bite to eat we saw their tiny lit up sign in the window that read ""OPEN"".  I looked at the hubs and we thought...why not!  They offer a full menu on Sundays along with a brunch menu. 

We decided on a full meal rather than brunch.  I split the small chopped salad that tasted great!  It was full of fresh cut meats and cheese along with some red onion and garbanzo beans.  All tossed in their great tasting caesar dressing.  I had the rigatoni bolognese.  The serving was HUGE and was incredible.  We were served some bread that tasted fresh!

Service was spectacular!  Our water glasses were filled multiple times.  I look forward to stopping my their deli in the near future or even planning a night out with my husband.  This place has a great warm ambiance.  I noticed they have a nice looking bar too!",4.0
"Giving three stars because the food was good as usual and normally the service is good. This is the first time the service was very bad.

"Tried this one out tonight after an disappointing dinner at Donburi.  Hoping to salvage a bad night, we figured why not try this new place.  There were only two people inside so it shouldn't take that long.... well did..  

Found out the desserts were made to order and we figured it was fine since we're not in a hurry. Ordered some souffle and tea and creme brulee.  Almost everything came after a good 30 or so minutes.... thinking they may still be making the creme brulee I just waited... everyone finished their drinks and dessert while my order still didn't show up.  Asked for it and turns out they didn't even key it in.  They offered to enter the order in but it would take another 15-20 mins... SERIOUSLY?  

Such a very disappointing experience.  A word of advice for the owner, you should rethink your business plan.  A made to order dessert business is good if it is for pick up or if you're catering to parties but to have a small cafe like that, you need to be able to serve your customer much faster.  

Also, if you're going to have your customers wait that long, you HAVE to make sure they are looked after.",1.0

"Bayside has one of the nicest dining areas among the Strip buffets.  The food selection is average and is good quality.  Iced tea is NOT brewed (a big ""no no"" in my restaurant evaluation criteria).  Compromise on dessert quality if you need to cut corners but make sure you fresh brew the iced tea.  

The best item on the day I visited was the prime rib.  It was tender, had nice flavor and was not bloody so you know they roasted it a while.  The food selection is not as vast as Bellagio, Wynn or M Resort but the price is commensurate with the selection.

"Saw this ""soda bus"" at Abari Game Bar a couple weeks ago, and made a point to definitely stop by at some point. It is an old VW bus that the owners converted themselves, and it is SO cute!

Hart's Soda Shop serves homemade sodas, floats and sundaes. We had a flight of sodas during this past Food Truck Festival. We tried the Mint Cucumber, Orange Cream, Root Beer and Dirty Chai. They were all really good, and a lot less sweet than typical sodas which is a really nice change! The flight was served in a really cute container. One of the owners even stopped by to ask about the flight experience, since this is a new item to their menu.

Stopped by a couple hours later and had the Unicorns Do Exist ice cream sundae. This is vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and sprinkles served in a cup with a cone dipped in chocolate syrup and sprinkles on top. The cone is upside down on top of the ice cream in the cup, so it looks like a unicorn horn. It was excellent! You could see the vanilla beans throughout the ice cream, so you know it is definitely high end. As we were walking to our car, a family even asked where I got my sundae. I'm sure the cone sticking out the top definitely piqued their interest! Of course, I pointed them in Hart's direction.

"I had no idea what I was getting into the first time I dined here. I mean, I knew it was a steak house, but didn't have any expectations.

When I arrived, my friend wasn't there yet, so the hostess invited me to have a drink at the bar while I waited. There was a gentleman playing the piano and singing. I ordered a drink. The bartender was very personable. He told stories, gave recommendations, and sang.

Finally, I went back to the hostess stand to be seated at my table. Shortly thereafter, my friend showed up. We ordered off the Restaurant Week menu (the reason why we had decided to eat here). I had the Del's Salad, the Handcut Filet, and the Cheesecake with strawberry topping.

The salad was amazingly different. It was topped with two strips of bacon and an avocado dressing. Altogether, it was delicious, but I didn't want to spoil my appetite so I only ate about half of it. When my filet arrived, we were asked to cut into it to make sure it was cooked to my liking. It was. The meat was so soft and seasoned to perfection. It was the best steak I had had in a very long time. The dessert was on point as well. To be up front, I'm not the big of a sweets person, but this cheesecake was to die for! It was light and not dense, and not too sweet either like how some frozen cheesecakes taste. This one felt as though it was homemade from scratch. I also need to rave about their banana bread pudding that my friend ordered. I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of banana flavored things. But this was easily one of the best bread puddings ever. It was perfectly soft and sweet and the banana wasn't too overpowering.

Our server did accidentally charged us for three people instead of two, but he quickly fixed this error. 

Del Frisco's was SO GOOD, I went back to eat there again the following week. I would easily recommend this steak house to ANY ONE living in or visiting Las Vegas.

Also, if you do go, ask to see the James Bond table! Super cool AND the girls know everything about it!",5.0
"My first upscale steakhouse chain dinner in Vegas was a 4-star review. This one was not as good.

I went to Del Frisco's for a private group dinner this week, covered fully by the host. I was anticipating a great dinner and primed to compare it fully with Fleming's, where I'd had a similar complimentary-for-guests meal.

Service here was certainly great, with constant water refills and timely plate changes and utensil removal. Judging from web site descriptions of private dining options, we got the Sports Room; the three television sets were reasonable for our purposes, albeit a little on the small side. Light and background music control were present.

As for food, I wasn't as fully impressed. It appears that we got a slightly adjusted Dinner Menu One, priced at $79 per person (similar to the listed price of my other meal, but with considerably fewer appetizers).

Complimentary bread and butter: fluffy bread coated with sesame seeds and fluffy butter. Pretty standard stuff.

Del's Salad: the only option for the first course. All the veggies were fresh and crisp, and the creamy dressing was addictive. The bacon was delicious, although not very crispy. It required considerable effort with the butter knife to cut it apart. I would've also appreciated more croutons on the plate, not just two modestly sized cubes.

8 oz. Filet Mignon: my choice, rather than the Roasted Chicken Breast or Salmon with Lobster Tomato Jus. I was instructed to cut it in half upon its presentation (on a very hot plate) to ensure proper doneness, and it was a very pink medium-rare. Tenderness was evident, as expected. However, the flavor just wasn't there. Whether it's a lack of seasoning on the crust or a less-than-stellar aging process, I was let down by my steak.

Green Beans and Chateau Potatoes: two side dishes, both served onto my steak plate upon my verbal confirmation and then left in the middle of the table. I loved the crunchy, buttery green beans but could've used a touch more salt and a lot more flavor in the potatoes. They were a mix of huge potato chunks and some mashed parts, which was fine, but I didn't find myself wanting to clean off that plate.

Chocolate Mousse: chose this for dessert rather than the Cheesecake with Strawberries. I'd been disappointed recently with various chocolate mousse desserts around town, but this was delicious and dark enough all the way through. Texture was consistently smooth as well. The raspberries were fresh but overpowering, so I opted to devour them quickly before enjoying the chocolate alone.

The red wine was okay. I overheard that it was a Malbec, but I wasn't intrigued enough to look into it further. They also aren't generous with the refills, which is probably best for the safety of all parties involved.

I would've given Del Frisco's 3.5 stars based on this meal, but I don't have the option of half stars and I certainly can't give it equal footing with my other recent steakhouse dinner. Maybe I'll come back in the future to try some other menu items, but I won't be in a hurry.",3.0
"I read some negative feedback about this centre and decided to find out myself the real story....and here is my honest opinion.

I love that it's super close to the bus stop - it's just a half block walk from the bus stop on King street (which turns out to be a perfect distance to cool down period after sweating like a pig for 90 minutes).

The open space which makes up the reception /resting or cooling area is dimly lit which gives it a nice calm feeling, particularly useful after 90 minutes of sweating.

I LOVE the instructors here, who seem to genuinely care about your practice. 
They correct your posture every time you need it, until you've got it perfect; and they let you know that you're doing it right. They remind you constantly that you need to focus on what you can do at your own level; push yourself if you can, but don't force it - remember that doing it right(right posture, right breathing etc) is more important than doing it more(but in wrong form). Should you fall out of your pose, they will encourage you to jump right back in. They will share their water with you if they see that you need it but haven't got any. They will explain what the benefits of each posture are. And if consistency is something that you like, the instructors here use a script (I think) and have just about the same message, structure and poses every time.  I particularly love the attention they give to newbies -which I feel, is how it should be - They are truly awesome; no hibijibi nonsense.
They warn you that it will be hard and that you will sweat like dirty pigs; one instructor even called it the ""torture chamber"" - but they also tell you that you WILL get better and to give it at least 3 tries before you give up - which I find is usually the day people realize how wonderful it is.
But for those who don't want to invest in buying a mat until they tried it, there is rental everything - mats, towels...and you can buy everything there too- gear, mats, towels, water bottles. 
Don't rent the towel for the mats though - it really smells, so much so that you wonder if it was washed...and a couple of postures require you to ""kiss the mat"".

There is a washer and dryer to wash your towel or gear while you cool down and wait in the long line up for the shower(there are 3 per sex) to become available.

This is the only studio which I've been to that has complimentary tea available in the ""cooling"" area - and great furniture - loungers, medicine balls, bean bags...etc. They are the only ones who offer cotton swabs, Q-tips and tampons in the woman's washroom.
It's also the only one which seem to keep a basket of lost and found stuff for people to rummage through.

What you will notice as you walk through the narrow hallway (Crammed with mat drying hangers, fans to cool them and washer and dryer) is THE STENCH. I thought it was just old sweat-dried clothes and feet smell(to know what I'm talking about, get some old clothes you did rigorous exercise in or get a sports teams uniform after a game, let it sit in a pile for a week or more), understandable in a yoga studio that only does HOT yoga - where 20 or more people sweat for 90 minutes 5 times a day. But then again....it wasn't like that at other studios.....anyway, it's not pleasant.

Then my friend pointed it out: it smells like SWEATY BALL SACKS.
There is no other smell like it - it's very distinctive...that's what the rental towels for the mats smell like...yum...

So the place is not for the weaker stomach or super sensitive noses....who want the ""flowery holistic experience"". It's not for newbies who haven't done ANY physical exercise in the past 5 years, because you'll have difficulty breathing in the heat, let alone move in it.  But it's a great place for those who want to sweat, be challenged and be corrected - you can come here and be privy to a different kind of yoga experience.",4.0

"Booked a reservation on Opentable for my girlfriend's birthday and it couldn't have been better. I arranged flowers to be at the table when we arrived and the staff made us feel important with a second floor table overlooking the bar, basically all by ourselves. 

The food is phenomenal. Not mentioning a specific dish here because I've had most of the options and every one of them was something I'd eat again in a heartbeat. 

The location seems a little dicey at first but as soon as the complimentary valet takes your car the restaurant seems like its own little island in Phoenix.",5.0

"Tavern 245 may have possibly saved mine and my good friend's life. After arriving late to Pittsburgh due to a flight delay, we asked a snotty cab driver to take us to a fast food drive through for something greasy, we had been traveling for about 13 hours and needed the sustenance he replied he didn't eat fast food.  So we wondered the streets of Pittsburgh at 12:30 at night, going door to door for food and finally made it to Tavern 245, where the coolest bartender gave us directions to get food, which we would not have found because the restaurant was on the second floor. After we ordered the food it was going to take 15 minutes so we ran back to have a beer while we waited, I went with an Ale and a Sam Adams October fest, I believe each were around $5. Then the bartender suggested we have the food delivered there so we did and had the best wings, pizza and beer ever. 

Came back the next day for happy hour, same cool ass bartender  was there and he made us a gin and tonic that was so good, so strong, so large, and so cheap ($4) it deserves its own 5 star review.",5.0
"I wish I could give zero stars to the owner MJ for his highly unprofessional business practice regarding the sudden closure of his Scottsdale StudioFit less than 2 weeks before Christmas. Things were great when a number of us joined mid 2015. Despite a change in managers and trainers, we remained loyal but we never once saw or met MJ. When we received the announcement that the gym was closing, we were bummed but hey, things happen. What really sucks is (unbeknownst to his staff), MJ came in 2 days before Christmas and ripped out all of the equipment! Save for a couple of sandbags, dumbbells and 1 Bosu ball, we had nothing! And to add insult to injury, we all got charged our final billing on the 25th for $18-$19. What a joke. MJ, your lack of professionalism speaks volumes. Your fantastic Scottsdale staff and loyal members deserved much better.",1.0
"Came here on 3/27/15
Stayed at the Luxor for 2 nights and the person at the check in desk offered that we can come to this club called LAX for free and be on the guest list. Luckily it was free because it is definitely not worth your time and money to even check this place out. 

Just go down the strip and find a better place than this. The go go dancers on the pillars are there to just attract people to this lame place. Small dance floor and no seating at all. The seating is all for bottle service. My gal friends got a wrist band for 3 free drinks that only can have vodka. Lame rule. 

Music was definitely replayed or looped because I heard a song being played twice in less than an hour. What kind of place plays Bon Jovi right after a rap song? Dumbest transitions of music! 

The location may seem big but once you walk just a tad, you'll notice that's all this place has for space. At least the club has a bar on each end of the SMALL dance floor. Hey guys, it's $18 for an AMF (not strong). Surprisingly enough, it wasn't as hot nor stuffy despite the place was pretty packed for a while. 

They have a somewhat strict dress code. My friend was nicely dressed but had teal blue Adidas and they didn't allow him in. He did go back to our room and changed shoes though. We went in and we saw a dude with a regular tshirt, jeans and vans. What happened to that ""strict dress code"" sign outside of that club? 

I'm really glad that my party and I got in for free because if I ended up paying, I would feel jipped and disappointed. Do yourself a favor and skip this club even if you have a ""free guest list accommodation"". There are many clubs just up the strip. This place is deceiving, small and very disappointing. If you're desperate, pregame at least. I'm not coming back here thats for sure.",1.0

Accommodations were made to ease my grandpa's infirmities and someone helped him navigate the restaurant to our table. Thank you!",4.0
Brought 3 small children. Had the $11.99 Alfredo specials AND used an email coupon for a free dessert. The staff treated us like we we're spending a million dollars.

"There are many other pasta places in town that I'd choose over Olive Garden. But they boyfriend had a gift card and free money is free money, right? The night before we ran a 5K, we decided to pay OG a visit and carb up. 

There was about a 15 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night. Looking around, there were plenty of tables opened, but I guess they were short on staff. A couple of booths were open at the bar area along with plenty of bar seating but we were never offered a spot there. We decided to wait it out. No biggie. 

Our server provided speedy service. No complaints here. They had a great deal going on: three course Italian dinner for $12.95.

Appetizer: You can choose from unlimited salad or soup. I chose the salad. Your typical appetizer salad. My boyfriend got chicken gnocchi soup. This was alright. Gnocchi had a grainy consistency to it. But the soup was tasty. He finished the bowl. Hot and fresh breadsticks were also brought out. No sauce. Sauce is an extra charge. 

Entree: I got the three cheese ravioli. Your typical ravioli. I really wish I had hot sauce to give it some flavor. I should seriously carry a bottle of hot sauce in my bag at all times for this! Anyways, my boyfriend got the Penne di Mare. This is pretty good. Small pieces of shrimp with cream sauce over penne pasta. Apparently, scallops were supposed to be in this dish. I didn't see any, but the dish definitely had the scallop-seafoody taste. 

Dessert: I got the chocolate mousse cake. Pretty darn decadent. I think this was the best part of the meal. But then again, I love anything chocolate. Give me chocolate and I'm easily satisfied. Boyfriend got the strawberry and white chocolate dolcini. This is way too sweet. Stay away. 

Overall experience was alright. We got what we came for (carbs, carbs, carbs) and left with a full belly. But the next time I come here will be only when I have a gift card to spend freely.",3.0

"The options available to customize your coffee or tea make coming to Crazy Mocha fun (instead of Starbucks or Dunkin). The downside to the Oakland location, however, is that very few people can actually hang out in there.

Service is great, biscotti is fresh, and the chai lattes are wonderful. Stop in sometime if you have a hankering for caffeine.",4.0
"Stayed in Gold Spike tower. They remodled an old downtown hotel to try to make it a trendy boutique hotel. Well a coat of paint and cheap artwork is what you get. My room door lock didnt work, the toilet didnt flush either. Downstairs turns into a nightclub every night and the next morning there is drinks spilled all over the floor. 
Now for the real pain in the ass...  in order to get into the hotel at night you have to go through the main front door which turns into the nightclub front door and the line is wrapped around the building so you have to wait in the line just to get into your hotel room. After a long day this is not what I need.

"After a year in Toronto, I'm pretty confident about claiming that Sense Appeal has the best, most consistent, most expertly-made espresso in town. For that alone they get five stars.

They also get a rousing round of applause for their house made treats and tasty light lunches, and a kowtow for being open Sundays even though they mostly serve the local graphic design, PR, and ad agency offices.

"I came here with a Groupon deal - $15 for $30 food. The platter we ordered was tasty and the portions HUGE (three of us couldn't finish the plate for two!), but the service was VERY slow. I wouldn't come here if you're hoping for a quick bite.",3.0
"This place and especially our last visit there was nearly perfect.

I called in advance to ask about parking (normally we've cabbed it uptown or taken the light rail, but this time we were driving and didn't know if the restaurant validated at a nearby lot, didn't matter, we found street parking right across from the Market) and spoke with a young woman who was pleasant.

We decided this time that instead of ordering nine different small plates, we would start with one then order two more and see how we were feeling.  Good call, we were stuffed. All in all the wife and I have been here a bunch and have tried just about everything on the menu and it has all been at the least 8/10 stars for taste and quality, so you really cannot go wrong, just order what sounds good for you at that time.

Beer/Wine selection is awesome for me (not so much for the prego wife) always a good list of great beer.

The only thing that holds our most recent visit back from a full 5 stars was the crappy attitude the hostess had. Horrible.  When I tell you we want a table, and you indicate we can sit at the bar, and we reply that we don't want to sit at the bar and would prefer to wait, don't give me the stink eye, do your job, walk around the MASSIVE dining room and see where people are at in their dinner service.  Then MAYBE extend some courtesy and say something, I don't know, along the lines of ""Well feel free to wait at the bar or right over here and I'll come and get you when a table is ready..""  Or just stare at us uncomfortably for a few moments.

Thank the lord above our server more than made up for the inexperience up front, she was quick, funny, and her timing was excellent.

Of course we'll be back, just hoping we don't have to deal with negative Nancy up front again.",4.0
"It's apparent there is some secret password for great food or something. People that had good food here, what's the secret? Is there a secret menu? It's really odd that all the reviews are either really good or really bad, with none that are mediocre.

I gave this place another shot and ordered crispy pork with chinese broccoli. When I saw it on the menu I was doing the happy dance. I usually order this at the local thai  places in LA, it's so good. A dish that is pretty simple but amazing when cooked right. When I ordered this, the owner was surprised and asked if I was Thai (which I am not, but I am asian and grew up in LA so I've had more than my fair share of thai food).. I was thinking oh yeah, he got intrigued by my order... this is going to be legit. 

What the hell! The pork was not crispy at all! The hugest let down ever. There is nothing worst than chewy, rubbery pork belly especially when it is meant to be crispy.  

I know all you loyal customers are thinking... whatever she does not know thai food and is not ordering the right stuff. Blah, blah... but I'm sorry, any Thai restaurant should have Pad Thai down, at the very least. 

Fooled me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!

P.S. I'm really convinced that there is a secret menu because the Pad Thai I described in my previous post did not look the very least like the one in the photo that someone posted here!",2.0

"BF and I are a big fan of Bobby Flay, so we were pretty excited to eat at Mesa. Sadly, Bobby was not there, and to my chagrin our server said we just missed him; he was there the week before. Ah well. 

The restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all the waitstaff were very professional and friendly. They have several lounge ""cubicles"" to wait while your table is being setup too, which I thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait. 

We ate:
3 course meal of: 
1) Blue corn pancake: bbq duck + habanero chile + star anise sauce - Pretty good, but a little on the salty side
2) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: pretty good, light and fresh, came with Mexican spiced fries too that were really good. This is what everyone calls the #1 dish here, but I really think that award goes to the corn tamale (below). 
3) Panna Cotta: SO GOOD - nice and light and the fruit was soaked in some type of liquor and really fresh and ripe. 


Others:
Appetizers: 
Cremini Mushroom Quesadilla: pretty good, but will try something else next time
Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: OMG I could eat this all day, every day, for the rest of my life. The shrimp was nicely seasoned and tender, not overcooked, the tamale was sweet and savory, the white corn was fresh and drowned in this yummy creamy corn sauce. YUM....

Friend got the Chile Rellenos, which was also quite good. Melt in your mouth cheesy-ness. Mmm

Get the corn tamale!!",4.0
"Bobby Flay's over Gordon Ramsey's Steak House.

Came here for my birthday, they don't do any free dessert or anything. If you order a dessert they would put a candle on it though. 

Bread Basket ( Free ) - Super yummy ! We really like the blue corn muffin.. it's soft and taste way better than your regular corn bread. The waiter let us get another order of it for free. 

Entrees -( Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops ) The best I ever had, seriously. I'm that one person that always order lamb and I can honestly say this was the place. My medium rare lamb was cooked perfectly.. not to rare either just perfect and ever bite had this explosion in my mouth. So mouth watering good, it also came with a blue corn tamale! How can a tamale be so soft and moist? Ugh, I want to go back and order this again. 

Boyfriend had the ( New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, cooked medium ) So good, I took a bite of it and the pork was moist and juicy. I didn't know you could get pork medium I guess it's just the part of pork you're eating you can. It also came with a sweet potato tamale, sounds weird together but very good. Make sure to take a bite of the pork with the tamale together... oh you won't regret it hahaha. 

Dessert -  ( Chocolate cajeta cake ) - Wow, moist! Seriously every dish is so moist hahaha. Best cake ever, try it guys. It's warm chocolate cake with ice cream, who doesn't like that? 

Overall everything was super delicious, service was good but not top notch. Everything was really filling, I honestly thought the dishes were way bigger, but the photos in yelp are all lies hahaha it's actually really small but when you continue to eat you'll actually get really full but  even though you're full you can't say no to dessert hahaha. 

2 Entrees - 1 Dessert = $108 and some change, which is a really good price for our meal.",5.0
"This is one of my favorite spots and I try to get here every time I come to Vegas as sort of our dinner splurge night. The staff is always pleasant and knowledgable, food is served in a timely manner and the ambiance is fun and upbeat without being overwhelming. 

I am not one to pick to eat goat cheese pretty much ever, but we went for the goat cheese queso and polished it off in record time. So so good. They also bring you a great assortment of bread that has chiles baked into it that's kind of perfect for dipping as well. 

We made a reservation (I'd suggest doing that regardless of what night of the week it is) but arrived a bit early and grabbed a drink in the bar. Bartender was super friendly and attentive and was slammed so I was impressed. We were seated right on time and service was prompt from there on out.

This time I had the chile relleno which is always yummy and my friend got the pork tenderloin which I hadn't had before. She let me try a bite -- I could cut it with a butter knife and it pretty much melted in my mouth. So delicious. 

This place will continue to be a staple for me in Vegas so I hope it doesn't go anywhere anytime soon! Definitely put this one on your list.",5.0
"I went to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill today.  The corn soup was great - picante en extremis, which is simpatico with me; the poblano green chili burger was flawless and great - muy sabroso. Finally, we get a celebrity chef who can cook a great burger the way you specify it.  Most chefs reheat a Sysco burger two rareness levels below your criteria.  I like my burgers very well done, and it came out that way. 

They didn't have full-bore Budweiser or regular Miller beer, or even XX in the green bottle; so I chanced it on some shit European beer which tasted like shit - and bitter shit at that.  Rather than suffer through it, I drank a little, cut my losses, then ordered a Miller light which was near perfect.  All these specialty beers from Europe are shit; they exist for frauds who need to position themselves as avant-garde connoisseurs of beer.  They are fooling no one.  The world laughs at them.  Service was excellent.  I left a slightly higher than 20% tip.  Like MacArthur, I shall return.",5.0
"I moved to the Phoenix just over two years ago from Seattle. I tried literally 8 different barbershops before I finally found Brooklyn Barbershop, and I haven't been to another barbershop since. I have been coming to Brooklyn Barbershop for about two years straight now. 

Brooklyn Barbershop has an upbeat, urban vibe as soon as you walk into the shop; you instantly feel and can clearly see that it is the right place to get a great haircut. 

Brooklyn Barbershop, has plenty of seating available during the time you may have to wait behind the vast amount of people that come through the doors all wanting to get a haircut from a few of the very best in the entire state of Arizona.

On a normal day, there is always a good selection of today's best local and underground music. From my personal experience, if you are looking to get one of the best possible haircuts around that will have an average Joe looking like they are ready for a photo shoot for a major magazine, I recommend either the shop owner and Master Barber Reny, or my main man Charlie. Both Reny and Charlie will have you leaving the place looking and feeling like a million bucks! 

If you are running short on time and couldn't swing past your bank or ATM to pull out some cash for your haircut, no worries, Brooklyn Barbershop conveniently has a state of the art ATM machine located on the inside of the shop. 

Lastly, Brooklyn Barbershop barbers all are proficiently trained and have natural born abilities to cut and sculpt any kind of hairstyle, or artistic lines of your liking. For guys like me who love that fresh razor edge up, this shop provides it all!

The drinks are some of the worst drinks I've ever consumed. I ordered a long island and got syrup and water. It was disgusting. They don't have a great beer selection by any means unless you favor the more commercial pisswaters, such as bud, bud-light, bud-extra-light...lime? Anyway...

When bands play live, the sound system that they have don't do them any justice. Pentagram played there recently and even Bobby Liebling complained quite a few times during their set. Every band I come to see complain about the horrible sound ""system"" they have to endure. The way they handle shows is not the greatest, with promoting, the amount they charge, the sound. This venue is thee worst possible place to have a band play.

Besides the place being a ghetto-styled, dirty cesspool, I would never come here willingly if it weren't for the bands that have no other choice but to.",1.0

"This was THE best experience in a medical facility that I have ever had! The facility was clean, the staff was friendly, and most importantly they were fast.  I NEVER go to the Dr because I find the whole process just annoying, making an appointment, being there 15 minutes early, as requested, to fill out paperwork, then sitting there for 2 hours past your appt time to be seen...its ridiculous! 
Today at Urgent Care Extra I was in and out of there in 30 minutes....and that was WITH filling out paperwork and I didn't even need an appointment!  Now to be fair, I was the first person in the door when they opened BUT both my sister and husband (who both HIGHLY recommended this place) have visited on different occasions, and  both said their visits were very fast and DARE I SAY...enjoyable.  If a trip to the doctor can be considered Enjoyable, they MUST be doing something right! The next time I am feeling under the weather I WILL be going here.  In fact, I may just make them my PCP (Primary care provider).",5.0
"Jason Smith Fitness changed my life.  A couple of years ago I did not have a balanced life.  I was eating the wrong stuff (whatever I wanted), not working out, and not feeling well.  

I went to Jason Smith fitness and immediately felt the passion that Jason and his staff have for their individual clients.  He trains in a very fair, accountable way.  Even when I was not excited to get the gym, once I walked in, Jason's passion for his work transferred to me, and he drove me to excellent results.  36 pounds in 90 days.

Jason is the best.",5.0
"Yeah, this place Rocks.  Tina is AMAZING!  I hadn't been there for months and I'm sure there had been hundreds of patrons since I was last there and when I walked in, Tina, the owner, remembered my NAME!!!!   Very entrepreneurial.  They don't remember my name at that ""other"" bakery around the corner on Ft Apache.  

They have a customer appreciation French Toast breakfast made with their Challa Bread every quarter.  I mean, eggs, bacon/sausage, fruit, coffee, juice, etc...It's a grub session for sure.  

When you go there to buy their baked goods, they have something for everybody.  I am partial to their Dakota Bread, but they have plenty of bread samples just in case you can't make up your mind.  They also have killah brownies, OH SNAP...almost forgot!!!  When in season their Black Berry Scones will change your life.  Amazing!  

They make a variety of cookies too.  Nom Nom Nom...

If you're an athlete of just a care about your health, this is a good place to find whole grain foods to provide you with proper nutrition for optimal health.

"I like this place but I'm partial to businesses owned and operated by persons not corporations and this place sure has that going for it. They work for your business and they care. A Subway will be opening up next door but other than that and Landry's, this busy strip has two other small businesses that serve great food with a more urban than suburban atmosphere. Coffee Tea etc has a great soundtrack and if the lighting was improved (even sun light warm fluorescent build are unmusical and unappetizing) it be five stars for me. I'm coming here with my laptop before work with good coffee drinks (standard fare) tic whack my mail or after work to reward my inner child with some ice cream. Thrifty beats the heck out of the overly sweet 31 flavors. The serve large portions here.

"Finally tried this place out, after wanting to for months! The restaurant itself on the outside is very simple and you probably wouldn't even realize it was there, unless you were looking for it. It's a very small cozy place and the food smells amazing as soon as you walk in! We ordered fried egg rolls to start. They were ok, I didn't like the sauce that comes with it and the egg rolls themselves didn't really leave me wanting more. 

The entrees are family style so we shared all the dishes. We ordered chicken bai cha (fried rice), grilled pork, and lok lak beef. The bai chia was good and they served plenty to share. The lok lak beef was too bland. The meat didn't really have much flavor and the veggies that accompanied it were just as bland. The best part of our meal was the grilled pork. This is the dish that they are known for, and recommend; and it didn't disappoint! The dish was just strips of pork but the flavor was amazing!  The sauce made it very flavorful and great! I couldn't get enough of that dish. I would highly recommend trying the grilled pork; but beyond that, none of the other dishes were memorable.",3.0

You can see it behind the counter with a general ""whatever"" attitude of most employees compared to many other Starbucks where all the employees move with a purpose. I'm finding another store, possibly off my route to work, that would be worth it to frequent.",1.0

"What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get",5.0
"Horrible service!!! I booked a cab online because I was on the phone, and promptly received a confirmation phone call. That's where anything good I can say about this company stops. 

They called to confirm at 4:03 and said it would be 15-20 minutes. With no sign of the cab at 4:41 I called to check the status and they said it would be another 10-15 minutes because of traffic. I do not live by any freeways so there is no reason a driver should be sitting in traffic. 

They just now picked me up at 4:54, so I have 6 minutes to get to the bank before they close. Awesome. And there is no A/C flow in the back seat on a triple digit day in Arizona.

"Traveling in from out of town I looked online at reviews. I found Trying to sell jewelry in Las Vegas that there are a lot of shops claiming to offer the most money with great reviews. This was my 1st stop based on their reviews and convenient location. Hidden in this little shopping center on the Las Vegas strip it doesn't seem very safe.  I received a offer but they did not seem to be happy with what i was asking. I remember what I paid but he disagreed, I felt insulted.  I left knowing I was going to get a second offer.

"I LOVE a good brunch!  I've been anxious to try Napa on Providence since they took over Providence Cafe.  Being seated 5 minutes before the magical ""noon"" alcohol time on Sunday, we were anxious to get our bloody marys.  At 12:15 the waiter's asst delivered water, but still no bloody marys or my friend's coffee.  Finally got them and the bloody mary was DISAPPOINTING!!  Not remotely spicy even though the waiter's asst asked specifically if we wanted regular or spicy.  After a few sips, I just couldn't take it so I asked to have a fresh one made, this one with some spice.  The second one was slightly better, but still not good.  I ordered the eggs benedict minus ham.  It was just that, eggs benedict without ham, nothing fancy or gourmet, nothing more than I could've made at home.  My friend got the proshetta hash (some kind of diced pork tenderloin) and she said it was ok but she left hungry.  My other friend got the margherita pizza which she said was good.  I wouldn't request to go back, but would be willing to give them a second chance if a friend said she wanted to go.  Disappointing!!!",2.0

"I'm told moving is one of the top 5 stressful things you can do in life, well I'd add home renovation as well.  I'm also told never argue in front of the help...  well technically we didn't, but we certainly had a disagreement right before Robert came to measure the windows.  It was probably our only major full blown ""tense"" discussion.. hahaha.

When we purchased the home, half the windows were already replaced and upgraded.  The prev homeowner gave us his window contact, stated he was so pleased with this guy and w/ several quotes, he blew the competition away.  We were looking for matching windows for the rest of the home and to take advantage of Federal engery tax credits, so we trusted the referral.

Enter Robert into a highly charged atmosphere.  We gave him our differing opinions, and he said in his gentle and kind way ""I'm a visionary, I can see where you are going with this.""  He goes on to give us some ideas and inputs, and very very tactfully, goes off into the bedroom to measure the windows there.  Amazingly enough, we needed that.  His inputs helped form a fairly different look and idea that we were both happy with for construction of the wall we were moving and window placement.  By the time he walked out of the bedroom, we were all smiles and eager to discuss the new window addition.

Robert and his helper replaced all the remaining windows in the home and cleaned up the dust afterwards.  Until I posted this review, never went to his webpage but glad to see the awards received for his great customer service.  I'll back that up as well.  

And our only major drama is over.  We're going to survive it.  :D",4.0

"We come here every once in awhile for the smoothies, which are typically quite excellent. However, today we tried the ""limited time only"" Luau Sliders, and we wish we hadn't. 

We got the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and two Sweet Sriracha Chickens.

They were 90% bun, with what looked like old, frozen white chicken. You know, the kind you had in your elementary school cafeteria. It's not like we were expecting a gourmet slider by any means, but they were certainly disappointing. 

Were it not for the typically great smoothies we get here, I would have left one star. That being said, even the Blueberry Bliss I got today was subpar, tasting almost entirely like a banana. I get banana is one of the ingredients, but the namesake should at least be the overarching flavor.",2.0

"Let me preface my take by giving full disclosure.  I came here with a client of mine who is a high roller.  So we got all the high end stuff and it was all comped.  So we got toro, foie gras, and kobe beef.  Its simply not possible to give anything less than 5 stars when you have that kind of menu.  

We sat down at the teppanyaki grill.  The kobe beef is absolutely positively the best thing I've ever eaten in my life.  For those of you who have not tried it,, it is indescribable.  It tastes like the best fattiest beef ever but the texture is really that of butter.  If you close your eyes and put a piece in your mouth you would never guess its meat.  It is unlike anything you will ever have.  The foie was just as I like it.  Kinda charred on the outside but rich and creamy on the inside.

Obviously this review is not representative of what a normal meal would be.  But I can only comment on what I've had and it was 5 stars all the way.",5.0

"Worst sushi I have ever had.  Bar none.  
Not a single roll was good. 

The rice was dry.  The flavors within each roll clashed.  The asparagus was undercooked.  The cucumber was hard as though it wasn't ripe for eating.  The sauces were flavorless.  The presentation of the rolls looked as though a bunch of random ingredients were mixed together.  The fish was the only thing on each roll worth eating. 

Even the sashimi was bad: octopus sliced so thick it was an unpleasant chore to eat it.  

Service, fantastic; dessert, good; ambiance, fine -- but nothing can make up for the fact that this is a somewhat spendy sushi buffet and the sushi was horrible.  I wasn't even there on an off night; it was Saturday at 6pm.  

Any other buffet in town that has sushi as a side-station would have been better than this place.  And I could have gotten three great, fresh rolls at any other sushi place in town for what I paid to have an awful, dry, mishmash of garbage at this place.

"This is a mixed review from only one stay here.  So take it with a grain of salt.

Got comp'ed a stay here with my wife from the Meadows Casino.  We had three hotels to pick from, and since neither of us had stayed there, we thought we'd give it a try.

We arrived there at 11:30PM after a valentines day night out.  There was no parking near the main entrance of the hotel, and being almost 0 degrees out we didnt want to walk far.  Luckily on the oppisite side of the building, there is a seperate entrance for their corporate meeting areas.  We entered there with no problem and there was plenty of parking near the door. *Keep that in mind if staying here for convenience.*

Even at 11:30pm at night there were 2 staff members at the front desk, which was nice.  We were the only ones checking in, but its nice to know that if there were a rush at that time, they are well staffed.

We got our key and went to our rooms.  We noticed the carpets could really use some cleaning, but at winter its tough to keep someplace clean like that.

We stayed in our room, which was well furnished, with a beautiful bathroom.  It was very clean.  The only complaint I had was the bed.  It was awful.  I'm not sure how anyone could be comfortable in it.  Both my wife and I got very little sleep because of it.

The hotel it great, I'd recommend it completely if not for the bed.  It was awful.

As I said, this is based only on one stay, so not all rooms beds may be that bad.  Don't let my review put you off from staying here.  Try it for yourself and post a review.",3.0

"We went to Joe's with an extremely large group.  We had some drinks at the bar and each of us was charge a gratuity of 18% on our tab.  After our bar drinks, we received no service from the waitress on beverages.

We ordered all of the sides, soups and salads on the menu and especially lots of snow crab.  We heard great things about the restaurant and unfortunately our experience did not match other's experiences.  The snow crab was significantly smaller than Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, where we ate the previous night.  We recommend Del Frisco.  The snow crab seemed to have been frozen for a very long time; it was fishy, grainy, and not well cooked.  The frozen taste was strong throughout our entire order of crabs.  It was so far from fresh and tasted terrible.  Even the horseradish sauce could not hide the low quality taste.

The artichoke and crab dip appetizer was excellent.

The Manhattan chowder soup was tomato based, salty, and TONS of DIRT grains.  It was difficult to consume with every taste full of grains. This was the worst soup on the menu.  The crab bisque was great.  

The plain potato hash browns were good.  They are boiled potatoes that are placed in a baking dish and toasted on the top.  Not great but good.  The Lyonnaise however, was not pleasant.  It was overfilled with caramelized onions, which were so overpowering you could not taste the potato.  

The cole slaw had an interesting unique tangy taste.  The texture of the cole slaw seemed prepackaged, over shredded, soggy consistency, and poor preparation.   Again, the taste was very unique.  Our group ate the least of this item.  The corn was not sweet; it had several bell peppers and way too much seasoning.  The spinach had too much cream.  The other sides were all very standard.

The key lime pie had a nice strong, sour, and thick creamy filling.  The gram cracker crust was over sugared and too thick.   

Worst of all, after such a disappointing dinner, our waitress made the mistake of charging our group the entire tab multiple times.  Several of us were charged the entire bill.  We brought this to the manager's attention and he had no idea as to how to handle the situation.  We had to break it down to the waitress and explain to her the billing error.  She had a difficult time understanding how to correct and reverse the charges.  We're still waiting on verification from our banks of the reversals, since the restaurant clearly cannot be relied on.  

Overall we would not recommend this restaurant.  Perhaps, at one time the Vegas location was of comparable quality to their other chains, but unfortunately this is no longer true.",1.0
"Parts & Labour's win on CMT's Burger Wars have spurred them to open up The P&L Burger in the space where White Squirrel Snack Shop once - briefly - lived. Similar to the previous tenant, stools line the front area and another set lines the block past the cash where eager eaters await their quickly served burgers.

While their show-winning The P&L Burger is available at the restaurant proper, you'll get it at their burger shop for much less. Current favourites are The Italian - a spicy mess of oozing cheese, marinara, and hot peppers (gonna add more hot peppers next time) and The Castor that sports a slice of peameal and smeared with sweet BBQ sauce. Those looking for a simpler deal should look to The Hamburger. Vegetarians can opt for The Big Tempeh.

From my order today, the bun to meat ratio is good and the flavour of the patty is also beefy enough to come through even the heavier topping combinations. The bun is fluffy enough (though I'd like a bit more chew on it - minor quibble), but holds together quite well. The size of the burger itself is quite large, though most should be able to finish this. Maybe with a nap later on.

There are onion rings, fries, dill pickles, poutine, hot peppers, and a caesar kale salad. I chuckled at the salad. Fountain pop gets free refilles and you can snag a milkshake or soft serve as a sweet treat.

My burger pick for the area.

"I will never use Alamo again!  The sales person at the front desk was only focused on up-selling my original order.  She was absolutely relentless and pushed so hard I only gave in to an upgrade, insurance and full tank of gas was so I could get out of there.  Every time I explained I was not interested she found me another ""discount"" and repriced the car rental.  I recognize that it is my fault for caving in but I have never been pressure so hard.    I'm sure she was compensated for her ""hard sell"" as I walked away with a bill for $450 - up from the $170 online quote .

i dont think they know what customer service means..

i asked reps in stores & via the website one, what i thought was, a simple yes or no question & never received the same answer twice.
wtf?

online reps,
lucky they dont have to deal with me face to face.
lady at the decatur store,
again, youre lucky i called & didnt come in.

after years in retail,
i cannot STAND bad customer service.
yeah,
im one of those people.


so,
why review this particular store and not complain to at&t directly?
well i did. BUT,

RJ, thats why.

what a breath of fresh air he was to deal with after everyone else encountered.
even with all the technical difficulties and EXTREMELY long wait to get my problem solved, this guy never lost his personality. professional, knowledgeable & so pleasant, he should replace that girl in the at&t commercials. for real.

i will ALWAYS request RJ from this point on.

"I recently started a job where I need to dress in suits, shirts, and ties.  So I was looking for a quality dry cleaner,  this place was in a good location to where I work and also to where I coach football.  I was a little weary of the place because it is not in the nicest location of town. I looked at yelp and checked out the reviews of other people and then started to feel comfortable with the place because of everyones high reviews.  Let me tell you this, this was the worst job I have ever seen of a dry cleaner, 7 out of the 10 shirts I brought were absolutely unacceptable I would have to iron them again if I want to wear them to work, they were still wrinkled and one of my white shirts actually accumulated some dirt on the right front chest, basically telling me that the water they use in there machines was dirty.  I don't know what person working there took these off the presses and thought it was acceptable to give me these shirts back.  The next day when I tried to go get a refund the girl working was new and told me she couldn't do anything and I'll have to come in tomorrow.  I asked about the owner or manager and she said he rarely comes in.  I am sure they will do them over again but i do not want to risk it and just want a refund I am going into the store today we will see what happens.  I don't know how there are so many good reviews on this place, but trust me I wouldn't trust a T-shirt to this place again...  I'd give no stars if it was a possibility.",1.0

"I only stayed at this hotel one night and found it to be very... average.  I was in Vegas for a wedding and booked this place through priceline as one of their ""mystery hotel deals"".  The price I got was reasonable, and the hotel (motel? the rooms all had exterior entrances) room was okay... I liked that they are all two room suites, but they were also very basic with nothing memorable.  The hotel was a reasonable distance from the strip, the bar charged reasonable amounts for drinks, and the parking (at least in my part of the lot) was... reasonable.  What was not particularly reasonable was the super late check in time... Most hotels I've stayed in have check in times of 2-3pm, and if a room is ready before hand will let you check in early.  The Alexis Park Resort had a check in time of 4pm and didn't really offer any flexibility... in many cases this won't be an issue, but since the wedding we were attending started at 5 and we had to shower and change before driving there it put us in a bit of a time crunch.  Made all the worse by the fact that we were literally sitting in our car waiting to check in for two hours. We ended up being a few minutes late to the Wedding.  Now, I don't necessarily hold the hotel responsible for that as it is their policy.  However, had tried to book the hotel directly, I would have seen this policy and gone elsewhere.  Regardless, I feel like they could have been a little more accommodating.",3.0

"NO STARS The whole rock in rio venue is total crap.  They did everything wrong.  The only good thing about it was seeing some of my favorite bands but thats it!  First of all they make you sign up to put money on your  wristband because they don't accept cash or credit cards.  Tax was not included in the price so you have to try and figure out how much you need on your wristband so they don't screw you over charging you 3.50 so you can get a refund on the money you didn't spend. You had to go to a station to load money on your wristband which had long lines by the way.  Also you had to do it in $10 increments only, which is such bullshit because you're more than likely going to have a few bucks left at the end of the event. What a coincidence you have money left over so let's give it back to you by charging 3.50!! The whole venue seemed like a dump trash everywhere and the bathrooms disgusting. They also had several 'rides'  you could go on the ferris wheel which did not work one of the days and the zip line which they closed of for some fucked up reason said it was closed and wouldn't let people in.  I went on seeing and listening to the bands trying not to get pissed at the fact that I couldn't get on it because they closed it hours before the venue closed only to find out they reopened it for only a few min and then closed it again. And by saying closed I mean closing the line because people were still going on it they just wouldnt let people get in line.  So more people went on it and I was not able to. When asking the staff why and if they could please let one more person in they just acted stupid and would send me to talk to different pleople because they were just trying to get me off their backs. So thanks Rock in Rio for fucking with my mood and making my experience seening my favorite bands not pleasant at all!! I only enjoyed listening to my favorite bands which would have been a much better experience if I had gone to see them one by one somewhere else. They rob you any way they can! If you want to see your fav bands you're better off going to their concerts don't waste your time and money on this crap!",1.0

The staff will first gently usher you to print your things at the station then keep talking over you without listening to your request. I was asked to ""leave"" because I was asking for too much.

"Such a quaint environment.  Reminds my wife of the hole in the wall places in New York she grew up with.  Decor was nice and prompt greeting upon entering.  Seated right away, they had about half the room full on a Friday night.  Usually busier as I have driven by before and seen it packed.  Here is the only reason it receives 4 and not 5 stars.  Server or the assistant.  We had to ask 2-3 times just to get some glasses of water for us.  They kept the other drinks full but did not bring water until we continually asked.  Other than that, our server was prompt to greet us.  He did take a few minutes to take our order which we were very hungry.  But food came out of the kitchen very promptly.  And now the taste was excellent.  Definitely up with some of the better ones I've tasted around town.  My wife had eggplant parm, which we really enjoyed as it was not breaded and that helped to not retain so much grease from the frying.  I had chicken picata which I really enjoyed.  One of the best in town!!  Overall, this place should get 5 stars if not for a couple of slight miscues on service but it is definitely some place we are going back.",4.0

"I have frequented this restaurant with friends/family for 10 ++ years , late night drinking would result in us eating at 3-5am at perfect chinese restaurant 
it is true the service is awful, at 3-5am sometimes you suck it up because there just isnt much choices at that time.

  Today was the straw that broke the camels back, i was with my girlfriend early afternoon it started with dirty chop sticks with dried vegetables stuck on it 
then we asked 3x times for a fork, 4x times for napkins, another 4x times for some winchester sauce that comes with spring rolls.

  They gave us VERY watery plum sauce for the spring rolls; it was disgusting just like most of there dim sum.  Finally after asking the manager; who then asked one of the same waitresses for the sauce again, she drops the sauce on our table, points to the disgusting plum sauce speaking in chinese RUDELY to us that we already have plum sauce as if we were not allowed .  My girlfriend politely with sarcasim says we enjoy it with winchester sauce.

i cant believe how rude that waitress is, when the bill came 23.28$ i made it a point to leave no tip.

"I've always passed by this restaurant and wondered how good it really is, so this weekend I took advantage of the the snowy weather and got some take-out. We ordered the traditional to see how good the food is.

Lemongrass Soup: Brothy, tangy and good. It reminded me of Tom Yum Soup. I was only disappointed to see canned mushrooms but delighted to see some fresh button mushrooms as well.

Panang Chicken Curry: This is my gauge to see how much I like the place, and Thai Orchid didn't disappoint. Well spiced and filling.

Pad Thai: Of course I had to try the pad thai as well. Ordered with shrimp although next time I might get pork or chicken. It was well made with a great tang that you would usually get with a squeeze of lemon that I would get at other thai restaurants.

"I also had higher expectations of Café La Gaffe. 
I've been here twice for lunch (with coworkers in 2013/2014 ) and once for brunch (today). 

Service:
- we arrived on Mother's Day (Sunday) around 11 AM & it was not busy so we got seated right away 
- they were understanding when we moved from the front patio to indoor before our food was served and let us have our pick of tables 
- came to offer a coffee refill 
- accommodating of providing a side plate for ease of sharing dishes upon request 

Ambience:
- simple, quaint 
- does not feel Parisian 
- pretty view from Windows of tree lined quiet street (Baldwin) 
- for brunch it's nice when the sun streams in through the windows 
- relaxing vibe if not too full; staff are not overly intrusive 
- main floor female washroom has very dim lighting which is less than ideal for make up touch ups 

Food:
- banana pancakes (3 slices cut in half) with a berry compote and a slice of honeydew melon; cantaloupe; pineapple. With maple syrup on the side (no idea if it was Canadian syrup etc) 
- friend has the avocado stuffed omelette with home fries and salad 
- both dishes were good and nice to share a sweet & savory 

I would recommend to a friend if they were in the neighborhood but not if they were coming downtown from suburbs. I would go again if someone else chose it/ planned it but if the choice was left to me I would pick somewhere new to try. 

As for when I came with coworkers in the past, lunch menu was good and for $20 you got an appetizer, main and a dessert. But service can be slow for large groups so order fast if you're on a time constraint. Can accommodate up to 10-12 people at one table.

We walked the grounds just to check things out and really liked everything we saw. We went to the pool area to find out how much the Cabana's etc would run for a return visit. Poolside was $150 rental and food minimum, the ones set off from the pool, which had TV, Fridge, phone, wifi, phone, etc. were $250 rental and food min. and the VIP units that include a two person hot tub and privacy were $350 rental and food min for the day.

"DISGUSTING! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN! 

It really takes a lot for me, not only to complain to the restaurant itself but to go through the grueling process of writing a review is unheard of in my world. I would have even kept my mouth closed and continued to frequent this establishment had they made me feel like a valued customer which I am and would have continued to be. 

First of all, the ""manager"" Bo is completely incompetent. My (almost) everyday ritual was to order the EXACT same sandwich through delivery and it has been good, most of the time. However, today it was terrible and only when you have a problem with your order will you start to see how poorly the rest of the business is run. 

After explaining my intention to take my business elsewhere due to the poor experience and also let others know, this ""manager"" Bo told me that I can stop ""threatening"" him. That doesn't sound like something a manager or someone with a vested interest in the company would say now does it? And furthermore, since when is letting a company know that you will take your business elsewhere a threat? 

Anyway, my tuna sandwich that I order almost everyday had more mayo than actual tuna. Thin strip of tuna, an inch layer of mayo glooping off the sandwich and getting all over my hands and everywhere else. It was very sloppy, wet, soggy and absolutely disgusting and they were not willing to fix the situation unless it was immediately at that moment due to a ""new company policy"". I will be calling and speaking to the GM tomorrow to question if this policy is real and if it will be continued because obviously you do not want another sandwich immediately when you have had a disgusting mess of one today. 

I will not be returning and will be spending a lot of time letting others know how bad the service is with this place. YUCK!",1.0
"Amazing ramen place that handmakes their own noodles right in front of you! Just be careful trying to take a picture of them running the noodles through the machine - it can get a little awkward when they see you taking photos of the employees.

I got the miso ramen. The broth was very flavorful and full bodied, the noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente, and all the toppings were delicious. One thing that I missed though was a lack of vegetables and more toppings. You can add extra toppings, but they were a little pricey and I expected a little more to come with my bowl, especially for the price. 

I ended up getting the original spice level because I can't take spicy food, but my friends got medium-hot level and they were all suffering greatly. If you're a spicy noodle lover, this is a good place for you, but be careful of what level you choose as they can make it really hot!",5.0

    You have a barista working for you that has a horrible attitude.  I've been coming to your shop for many years and even though I now live out of town, I still stop by when I have business in the area.  I've been in twice in the last 3 weeks and both times she was, for a lack of a better term, ""shitty"".  I now live in Portland, Oregon, the world headquarters of ""I can't be bothered with your order / roll your eyes / holier than thou"" baristas so I'm used to it.  I'm also used to excellent service from high end third wave coffee shops

    The barista I'm speaking of has short brown hair and tattoos.

    Two weeks ago I stopped by with a friend (who owns a business on the street) and since he doesn't drink coffee often he asked me to order for him.  I ordered 2 cortados with a little vanilla.  When she presented them she announced the drinks in a voice I would use if I were telling a story to someone and wanted to make the person I were quoting sound like they were mentally retarded.  Yesterday I had a cortado and then later ordered one iced.  I'm aware that you wouldn't steam the milk and then ice it but instead of her just making a short latte or explaining that pleasantly, she mumbled a bunch of stuff under her breath to her translator (the man working the register) as she stared annoyed at the espresso machine.
    I'm 3 feet away from you.  I can see you, I can hear you and you can hear me.  I realize you can't be bothered with the common folk ordering coffee but you're just making more work by running every question and response through the other person.

    There are decent coffee shops popping up all the time in Pittsburgh.  I don't need to be patronized just to get a decent cup in your establishment.",2.0
"Elite Investigations just took the biggest weight off of my shoulders with the information they were able to find for me.  Not only was their staff professional, knowledgable, and understanding but they truly went above and beyond the call of duty for me.  I am so thankful that i chose do to do business with them.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",5.0
"I went here today. I have been going to Larrys for about 8 years. Not going back.
I go about 4 times a year and stock up. Ran out of some items a couple months ago purchased a rack of ribs to slow cook in oven. Before they have cooked so tender no knife needed.  This past trip,  the counter person says, I have to open a new bag. Huh? Anyway, bought them,  cooked them the same as before but no joy. Too tough and fatty. I chalked it up to either a bad selection (which I didn't get to choose) or new supplier. Just told myself not get ribs there anymore.
Today was looking at the ribeye steaks. They looked terrible. Looked like gristle running through center of the steak, and small and overly fatty - not neatly trimmed at all. Didn't get that,  got ground beef instead. When I got home, when I went to repackage for the freezer, it just didn't look right and texture seemed different. Will see when I cook it if it is different or not.
At register just because, I mentioned it looked different inside - did the place get new owners.  Turns out yes, new owners. I don't know that the new owners changed suppliers,  but I am guessing it is either that or buying a lower grade of meat.
I hate to give a bad review of starting businesses,  but I go to a butchers expecting to pay higher prices for a higher quality product. I could have gotten the same or better at the regular grocery store from what I saw today.
Never again.",1.0
"Ok, so I have 2 confessions. 1) I'm a massage addict! 2) When I want a massage, I want it NOW! (Making an appointment is so overrated these days.) Relax Foot Spa is the perfect solution to both of those! Walk-ins welcome and you are sure to leave feeling like a million bucks. {Note: You may want to make an appointment if you go on a weekend, they tend to be busier then.} 

For $45 you can get the combination reflexology massage which works your feet, neck, back and legs. {Heat packs, warm towels, the whole deal!} for 60 mins. Yes, 6-0 not 50 like the common chain massage joints. I like deep tissue and they always use more than enough pressure. To say that you'll walk out of here with happy feet is an understatement. 

I'm also a firm believer that reflexology has CURED my sciatica!! The next time you need to release some tension after a crazy Monday or stressful week, this place is your answer, promise! And if you don't have an hour to spare, their 20 min chair massage will do the trick!",4.0

"I was utterly shocked to see Carmellas rated on Yelp with anything less than 4 stars.  This place serves absolutely authentic homemade Italian dishes at their finest.  My wife and I have been going here for a little over a year and I am continually blown away.  Definitely on my 'short list' when eating out.    

Just finishing leftovers of the penne arrabiata.  Scrumtulescent.  Forget Papa Johns or Dominos and try their pizza next time you're in the mood.  It's superb. 

I have no idea how someone could conceivably think this place had canned pasta sauce.  Their sauce is so uniquely fresh and delicious.  A rival restaurant review perhaps?

If you love Italian, you should really check this place out.  Mike and his family will treat you right!",5.0
"I've been here a couple of times and this place has become a ""has been"" although I would question if it has ever really been a ""go to place"" ever. I would have to say Toronto is known for the consistently worse pizza in the world.  We have pizza on just about ever corner and none of them are good. This place does nothing to remedy this. Many of the pizza places don't use real cheese (eatable oil products from the ground aka crude oil for cheese).  If you are looking for warm and friendly this is not the place for you. The attitude here is not what it use to be. If you like cardboard with ""cheese"" and meat, then this place is for you. It's busy although I have never understood eating at restaurant just simply because it is trendy regardless how bad the food and service. Pizzeria Libretto is all about production, getting you in and getting you out quickly and service along with customer care is out the window. The foods not that great yet for some reason this place is popular. I can't figure it out.. can you? Compared to Leveto, no comparison.",1.0

"One of the best doctors I've been to, it is so hard to fine a good doctor that knows what they are doing. He has always been timely in getting me referrals and has always been thorough when I've had medical problems arise instead of brushing me off like doctors often can do. The rare times where he isn't sure what else to do or if something needs specialized attention he will refer me to a specialist. 

I'm not sure what all happened when he previously worked at Fit, and really I don't care, he has been a great doctor for me and knows his stuff. I trust him and he has never broken that trust with me, he cares and that is what matters most in a doctor. When we move up north to Washington State I will definitely miss him and his staff. I hope I am able to find someone half as good!",5.0
We wanted to try a new Vietnamese restaurant in the area and many friends recommended this place. This is where we discovered Mi Quang!!! Never had it in my life and it was life changing! The owner highly recommended it and it's not even on their menu. It was so well balanced. It's a little sweet and a little spicy with both seafood and meat! That's usually weird but it works so well. Even the side dish of garnishes are different than pho. The sesame rices cakes on the side are a great touch as well. My wife has the vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and BBQ beef but we've had better else where. Fast service and very clean inside. Can't wait to try their other dishes next time.,4.0
"Thus far this has been the most complete museum experience I've had in Charlotte.  Even for two total NASCAR noobs, the museum is fun, engaging and interactive.  
You start with a brief video that outlines the history of NASCAR, and then move forward into the exhibits.  Of course there's lots of memorabilia, gear and automobiles on display, but the standout would be the many activity-based exhibits.  With your Hard Card, you can compete against family, friends and strangers in trivia contests, simulator rides, pit crew competitions, penalty scoring and refereeing, and many of the other behind-the-scenes sort of aspects of NASCAR racing.  There are one or two of these stations where you do have to sit and listen to a video or computer explanation for a while before you can actually start interacting, so if you have the patience you earn the points.
What was really impressive to me is how much time you end up spending here, again even as NASCAR nonenthusiasts.  The place is so interactive that hours pass and the only thing that might snap you out of it is a rumbly in your tumbly.  
As someone else mentioned, it's a bit much for little bitty kids, but your school aged kids should have a good time. 
Oh, and if you're a Bank of America customer, bring your card in on the first weekend of each month when admission is *!FREE!* for cardholders!  Yeah that aspect of it probably made everything seem even better to me.  Totally a fun place to go.",4.0
"I had heard rave reviews of the Bink restaurants and was excited for my first foray.

Well, that excitement was soon tempered by a less-than-stellar experience.

We arrived and were seated.  I took a good 7 minutes for us to even be acknowledged at our seats.  Finally, we asked for some water which was brought to us with a perfunctory ""sorry.""  Then, we had to ASK for bread.  Finally, our drink orders were taken, and we waited for our drinks in the time it would've taken to ferment a glass of wine.  The gimlet I had was just meh.  I've had better.  

Then, it took forever for the waiter to take our food order.  Once he did, we waited, and waited.....and waited.   He then told us that they were short-staffed that night and was profusely apologetic.  That helped ease the experience, but frankly not enough.  The butternut squash soup was good, but overall the food wasn't great.  The cauliflower tasted like they had haphazardly emptied their entire artisanal salt shaker onto it.  It wasn't worth complaining about, because by the time we could get anyone's attention and a new order it would've been a good hour.

I recommend the push-pop dessert which was made with lime sorbet and oatmeal ice cream.  It tasted like a key lime pie.  It was made ahead of time so was actually brought out rather quickly.",2.0

"My wife and I recently moved here from Orlando. After having the same dentist for 17 years, we were nervous about finding a new dentist. We live so close to Mountain Dental Group, we decided to start there. To be perfectly honest, we really expected to have to go through a few places until we found a good fit. Bingo! It seems the first time was the charm. We were impressed with how modern the equipment and facilities are. The office staff were friendly. Of course the real test is the dentist. Dr. Yanga has a great bedside manner and thoroughly explained everything. Suzanne did a wonderful job with my cleaning. Marlon assisted Dr. Yanga on a subsequent visit when I needed a crown, and was not happy until everything was absolutely perfect. I realize it is not possible to please everyone all the time. However, based on my four visits so far, I would say we found a winner.",5.0
"I wanted to give this place five stars so bad, but what holds me from doing so is the fact that they charge you change if you spend less than five bucks. I almost never carry cash and I find this so unfair, especially since I rarely spend less than five bucks; I always buy for all of my family. It just doesn't seem right. With that said, they have the best boba in Henderson hands down, I always try something different and I'm never disappointed. The boba pearls are always cooked perfectly, no complaints on the tea. This place is great, but please stop charging extra for spending less than five bucks.",4.0

"Stopped in because I had heard a lot about this place and as usual, people are wrong. The food is horrible. I didnt finish anything but my ice tea. Bland, cold and all around gross.

Al pastor and carne asada tacos on corn tortillas. The hot salsa. Cabbage.

Both the pork and the beef low quality. Every bite was full of gristle and to make matters worse it was cold.

Veggies were good. Chips were good.

I swear the cabbage was the most flavorfull thing on each taco.

The staff was great. Good kids working here who obviously want to do a good job.

Wada Street Tacos dont just have these guys beat, they are thrashing them in every way possible so do yourself a favor and go there.",3.0

"Had the WORST club experience I've ever had last week here thanks to the bartender working in the Ivy Lounge area on Saturday night. He was a white bald guy with a beard and tattoos on his arms. 

Apparently he was one of the head bartenders but never had I had someone be so rude. I had ordered 6 shots of patron and 4 bud lights and 2 coronas so far in about a 20 minute period from him. I gave him 20 dollars in tip in about the 20 minutes I had gotten these drinks from him. I return to get another shot of patron for myself and get a patron shot chilled. He does not chill the drink and when he pours it he does not put a lime on there either. I put down a ten dollar bill for the patron shot and a one dollar bill, he didnt chill it and all i had left in the wallet were two hundred dollar bills which i did not want to break. When I ask for a lime for the shot he THROWS THE LIMES AT MY PATRON SHOT FROM BEHIND THE BAR. One of the limes plops into the patron shot which splashes onto my shirt. The other lime bounces off the glass and onto the girls dress that was with me. I try to get his attention and he completely walks away to the other end of the bar blatantly ignoring me. As I continue to try and get his attention he then points at the bouncer and points at me saying to kick us out. When I have done absolutely nothing wrong. He then says I am not allowed to get loud at the bar. The place was empty, and I wasn't loud. Then, he picks up the girl im with's beer and my lime soaked patron shot and pours them on the floor of the bar trying to look all cool and slick. 

Overall this is the worst experience I have ever had at an upscale club and will never return. I have been to label many times for many events. On New Years me and my friends got a table and spent over 4000 dollars on our tab. I am not some chump who comes in for the beer special and do not deserve to be disrespected by a two bit bartender. I have never had any experience like this but this bartender deserves to be fired and I don't want anyone to have to deal with him again. I will be trying to get in touch with the owners of label to make sure he is fired. I enjoy partying here but me and all the people I associate with will not be returning any time soon.",1.0
"I didn't know what to expect coming to a pizza place that has gotten rave reviews from people in Arizona. I didn't know what would come of a chain pizza restaurant. Was it going to satisfy my East Coast palette? Or was I going to be left to wallow in an endless craving for the perfect slice, set off once again by sub-par sauce, thick and chewy crusts, and a goop of who- knows- what- kind- of- over- processed- cheese beginning to line my arteries. 

This is a different kind of pizza. This is not the ""peasant pizza"" I am used to liking. This is also not the gourmet type you would find at Pizza Picasso. This is a kind of hybrid brand. 

Unlike the Prius I rented on my most recent trip to New York, I liked it. 

The sauce was tangy and ubiquitous. The cheese was light and tasty. Most of all the crust impressed me with its slightly sweet taste, perfectly complimenting the sauce and cheese combination. 

I also ordered a bowl of the soup of the day, which was tomato. Tasty. 

I'll be back, but not when I'm craving a NY slice. When I'm feeling a little fancy, I'll be back at Sauce.",4.0

"2012 Fall Restaurant Week Lunch #1. I'm going to try pump these reviews out fast. Just in case people had a hard time choosing where to go... like me!

My friend and I wanted to find a sushi place who offered a lunch course for Restaurant Week. We both never dined at Sushi Roku previously. It's located on the Strip side, 3rd floor of the Forum Shops. For Restaurant Week, they're offering a 3-course lunch for $30.12. We ordered each option. I've posted pictures of all our food.

For lunch:

1st Course:
Choice of: Spicy Tuna Hanabi (crispy rice cake) OR 
Seaweed Salad (cucumber sunomono, plum vinaigrette)

2nd Course:

Choice of: Sushi (tuna, yellowtail, salmon, albacore, whitefish, spicy tuna roll, miso soup) OR Grilled Petite Filet (homemade teriyaki sauce, steamed rice or mashed potatoes, miso soup)

3rd Course:
Choice of: Mini Chocolate Cake OR Fresh Fruit & Sorbet 

The appetizers were nothing spectacular, not even spicy. The sushi fish and miso soup did taste fresh. They didn't ask us how we wanted our filet cooked, it came to us medium-well. My friend didn't mind it, but I'm more of a medium-rare steak lover. Not only was I confused that a sushi place was serving mashed potatoes, they were pretty dry and ordinary. Spicy tuna roll was pretty standard. 

The chocolate cake was good, a bit too rich and dense for me. 

The tastiest thing was the mango sorbet. I'm not a big sorbet person, but this one was truly delicious. It wasn't mango-flavored. You could actually feel the strands of real mango in the sorbet. Best I've ever had. 

The presentation was great. The service was on point, from the hostess, bussers, our server, and the sushi chefs who greeted us hello and farewell.

I had a good time, it was one of those lunches where nothing went wrong, yet your tummy wasn't doing the happy dance when you left. The service and presentation, (and of course the sorbet!) made this 3-stars for me. I wonder if I would've had a better experience if I had come to order off the regular menu. Other than it being an opportunity to donate to charity, if Restaurant Week is a chance for establishments to show what they can offer, Sushi Roku didn't impress me that much...",3.0
"I was with a group of about 15, age ranging from about 18-25. We decided to go to Deja Vu since it was 18+ and got V.I.P Passes from a man on the streets for free, so long we give him a tip. (NEVER PAY FOR STRIP CLUBS IN VEGAS! Just walk down the strip and you'll see so many heads asking if you want free passes to the clubs and are only asking for tip which is like $5/person.) We were swooped up by the club's limo at our hotel. The limo couldn't fit us all so it had to make two rounds. When we first got there we just chilled in their adult store. The store looked like a ghetto shop. I know I wouldn't want to stick anything from there in the vajay, their shit looked used and abused! LOL. finally, after waiting 30 minutes, the rest of our group joined us. We entered and you had to pay a $10 bar fee charge which was ridiculous! The club wasn't too janky, it was cool. You can say it looks like the same one in the movie Striptease, filled with lights, stages, and a bunch of horny bastards, minus myself =). The guy in front asked us if we wanted to get a private section with 3 Champagne bottles and hookah for $10/person.  We obviously said yes and we sat in this cushiony section in the back of the club. while waiting, i notice a little menu on our private stripper stage and it said ""V.I.P Section! $150 dollars! blah blah, blah blah, some more blah, and 3 Bottles of NON-ALCOHOLIC Champagne!"" bitches jipped us hard! so we pretty much payed an extra $50 for useless apple cider! LOL. 

They had some cute girls in the club, but some looked like they just got out of class in the h.s down the street. LOL. a lady came to our table, she was a blonde girl who had long legs, a body, and an ugly face! hahaha! this lady was vicious looking, straight from 8 mile. her skinny body makes it seem like she doesn't eat! but i had to give it to her because she was nice.. the only one giving us attention. (probably because no one else wants her but whatever.) there were $1 lap dances and this girl went in circles. the guys would put dollars on their lap and she straight up asked them ""DO YOU WANT ME TO GRAB IT WITH MY PUSSY?"" jfal;ddsfsjfjf! (note to the wise, don't put money in your mouth, it was probably in someone's vajay.) boys obviously said ""DAMN!!"" as she did it, but us females were grossed out and grabbed our vajays as if we just got our balls kicked. I really didn't want that std dancing machine anywhere near me! I wasn't trying to get her infected vaginal fluids all up on my pants, even if my pants were cheap! but i got to admit, it was pretty fun and funny. after a while separated and went to other individual stages. some girls were really good, while others seemed like they couldn't wait for the song to be over! Strippers can be really rude if we didn't drop anything, but she should've blamed her lack of exotic dancing techniques. Other strippers there were really playful, and if you put a dollar anywhere around you're body, they'd grab it with their mouth! =D and i must say, it was pretty darn sexy.

FUNNIEST PART!
so there was a stripper at the club... OBVIOUSLY.. but anyways, she was the one that looked like she came straight out of class with her braces. after she was dancing, this girl went around the table on her hands and knees, literally. (collecting her dollars on the floor) and started asking us for tips! HA! hahaha. but that's not the funny part.. the next day, we saw her at the local mall with who seemed to be her parents! LOL! the end.

"Worst er hospital experience ever, and I'm not one to complain. I have worked in emergency medicine for 7 years and 2 months ago brought my infant in to be seen after having bloody urine and 104.3 fever. We had been discharged from another er the day before and he'd been screaming uncontrollably for 7 hours that day and I was having difficulty controlling his fever. When we got there, There was a long line just to be seen by the nurse, aka get triaged. After 30 minutes of waiting just to get to the front of the triage line the nurse didn't bother to even look me in the eye even though both my son and I were crying at this point. (On a side note, not one child in front of me was crying or in any distress). The nurse showed zero empathy whatsoever. Part of triaging is assessing the sickest children first but I didn't even get a glance for my very sick baby. While I was waiting, I spoke with our pediatrician who advised me to leave considering my son hadn't even had vitals taken after over 30 minutes. When I told the nurse I was leaving she said ""well as you can see we're very busy"". To which my reply was ""I'm not asking to skip the line, only have my baby's vitals taken in a timely matter. What if he has a ruptured appendicitis or something life threatening?"". I said ""if his vitals are normal I'd be happy to wait like everyone else, I just want him triaged"". We finally got the vitals which were relatively normal after I'd dosed him with Motrin and Tylenol. The nurse said it would be probably a 6 hour wait. So we left, and went to his pediatrician who saw us that evening to evaluate us since they were very concerned and we subsequently went to honorhealth Shea.

We got our first bill of $250 on July 5. We disputed it stating we never even saw a provider and were not triaged appropriately, the nurses were very rude and even our pediatrician advised we go elsewhere. The billing lady told my husband she would send it to her manager. Today, we received a bill stating they were sending our ""$50"" bill to collections. Ummmmmm what?! We've only received one statement which we contested so not sure how that qualifies to go to collections this soon. I will never advise a patient to go there for an emergency. Ever.",1.0

"Why does no one make a bigger deal that we have a baseball stadium here in Las Vegas?

It's behind the Neon Sign Museum and next to the Natural History Museum.  All this time, and not any significant peep of its existence.

It's a small stadium, they don't have individual seats like in a major league stadium, but it's still very nice.  They thing most prevalent in Vegas is the ""it's the thought that counts"" mentality the locals get when it comes to non-Strip entertainment.  Either it's half-ass and kind of meager, but you can at least say we have whatever locale, or they really make the most with what they have.  This is a latter situation.

I found the stadium to be clean, in a good location (next to museum row), the food service was good, people were friendly.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that the 51's won on their June 3rd outing, but they really put some heart into the field with all the hokey music, the between innings games, and their mascot.  I can't really fault anything.  Of course, $1 beer night doesn't hurt matters, either.

Seriously, Vegas needs to get its priorities straight.  I've visited Vegas for 8 years, and lived here 2 1/2 years, and I never knew this place existed.  That's not to say that I'm the defining measurement of all things that happen in Vegas, but you'd think I would have heard of something by this point in time.  I'm sure tourists wouldn't mind knowing what's up either.

"This place has changed hands and as a result my two favorite menu items disappeared.  The live jazz disappeared.  And the last two times I went in there it was hotter than outside in summer...I had to leave because I STARTED to sweat when I went in there.

"This is a long overdue review. I came here for my birthday (January) because I read so many good reviews and someone even told me that Yasu came from Kaji so I thought to myself, it must also be excellent here.

We each ordered an omakase ($120 and $150) and a bottle of sake. The restaurant looks a little dated (typical look of a Japanese restaurant) and only seats around 20 people. We got the last two seats at the end of the bar facing the sink (water splashing with no fucks given) beside the kitchen (worse seats ever) with servers walking into my chair. We were served a variety of starters/appetizers none of which stuck in my memory because it wasn't anything spectacular. Mainly, traditional Japanese new year dishes and soup. The food arrived in a timely manner where we would finish a dish and the next one would be served within 5 minutes but when we got to the nigiri, we had plates after plates lined up in front of us. It was so overwhelming having 6-8 nigiri lined up that we lost track which one should be eaten before the next. It felt so rushed that we couldn't enjoy each piece. Their nigiri wasn't anything spectacular, if anything too much sauce or wasabi. What really ruined the night was the unagi nigiri I had. It still had bones in them and I tried picking as many out as I can but sure enough, one got lodged in my throat so I tried taking big gulps of tea, swallowing a chunk of rice, coughing it out, picking at my tonsils, nothing helped. I felt so uncomfortable that I even puked trying to get it out. I understand that the bones can be eaten from the unagi but clearly this isn't one of them. Their dessert was gelato with some random pieces of fruit and a soggy macaron. No thoughts or effort involved what so ever.

I didn't give them such a poor rating just because of the bone but because I had such high expectation of this place and thought the quality of every dish served would be decent especially for that price. Spending around $400 (tax and tips included) for dinner with ""meh"" food, leaving thinking to myself, what did I eat? Which piece stood out from the rest? How were they different or better than other places I went to? I honestly couldn't answer any of these questions.

I hate comparing them to other omakase places because I know every chef puts a little spin on the way the execute their dishes but this restaurant had such poor execution, lack of thought and very non-nonchalant attitude on what they were feeding their guests that leaves such a bad taste in a mouth, figuratively and literally.

I would not come back.",1.0

"I will say from the get-go that I would probably give August 8 an extra star if the value was there. The food is good but I feel that $28.00 per person ($26.00 on weekdays) is quite expensive compared to other AYCE sushi places I have tried in the GTA. The price doesn't even include tea, which I found a little crazy.

Clean and modern restaurant interior. Ordering via iPad at the table is convenient, and it's nice to see photos of the menu items. Tempura was great, thin crispy batter and not too greasy. Dim Sum was quite forgettable--wouldn't recommend it. Sushi was fresh, and had good flavor. They also have Sapporo on tap.

The service could be improved upon a bit--we had to ask for more water a few times, asked for wasabi and ginger twice (which was brought out in one small bowl that was not easy to share). To be fair though, everything we ordered on the iPad came out quickly. 

All in all, I will go back, but for lunch instead as the price is almost $10.00 cheaper for the same AYCE menu.",3.0

"We were only driving through Cleveland on the way to Milwaukee, and we needed to stop for lunch. This is a pretty small restaurant, but it is very well decorated and arranged. It was quiet---perhaps because they just opened for the day, and there was only one other table full--- which was a nice break from the usually noisy restaurants. The food is your basic sandwiches and grinder fare, which they did pretty well and pretty inexpensively. The server was sweet and attentive, perhaps because she didn't have much else to do, but nevertheless, was better than many of the others on our trip. Nice little spot that bodes well for Westlake's image.",4.0

The dungenese crab is mostly eggs mixed a tiny bit of crab meat, and the ducks are mostly left over duck meat. Very disappointing and not worth the money at all. 2 courses + water costed $130. You can get much much better authentic Chinese food with fraction of the cost in China town just a few blocks away. The restaurant decor is modern and the ceiling lights rotate once in a while, but I guess most of the money you pay for is for the decor and not for the food.",1.0

"Contractors always state there fees via phone or on arrival after assessing the job.
Additionally, there is only one ""emergency"" fee if at all with such contractors. Dry Force came on the recommendation of a plumber. They came on a weekday during business hours.
Dry Force came for a proposed leak behind drywall in a bathroom. The job took 3 hours and a few days of a dehumidifier and heaters.
We were billed 2 separate ""emergency"" visit fees at $195 EACH for ""demolition"" and ""water extraction"".  We were also double billed for labor. We were billed 6.5 hours for water extraction and 3 hours for demolition.
It was a small job and we paid $1500!

"One of the best nail salon for sure. modern and chic décor, doesn't smell like your typical nail salon coz they do mostly gel? Their 3D art is awesome...my daughter luvs it! They also post your nail on their instagram site...so you can get ideas there too. 
I don't stay with one tech as everyone I've tried been 4-54stars, just specify your likes and dislikes...for me, I like mine thin with 2-3coats and close to cuticles...so that's like something I tell them everytime otherwise I end up with useless fingers for couple of wks (nails too thick cant pick up anything....ughh frustrating!)  
I do mine pretty regular nowadays, so I just get the soak off and application -comes up to $30? plus tips. If you soak off/remove old gel at home,  it will only cost $25. 
Like any salon, if you don't specify what you want you may end up with extra services u may not need...they charge $10-$15 extra cuticle removal and some hand massage. Unless you have cuticles up to your neck, the regular application shd be enough as they have to trim and file your cuticle anyway.

"In the last couple of weeks we've visited Rustler's Rooste twice.  The first time we went was with a group of ten for Happy Hour.  It was a great place to go.  We had great seats with views of Phoenix.

The service was good and so was the food.

The second time we went was a little over a week later.  It was our anniversary and we were anxious to try the steaks.  Again, the service was good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and extremely tender.  Our only wish was that they had been seasoned. 

We ended up at a window seat with a group of 7 or 8 at the table next to us.  It was obvious they were in the area from out of town and on business.  How did we know?  Each one tried to talk over the other and we couldn't help hearing every conversation they had.  Obviously, we moved.

Rustler's Rooste is a unique place to visit.  We love the decor and the view.  We also liked going down the slide.  The first time we did and the second time a family had several kids that thought it was a toy to go over and over again. 

Oh well, we would go back.",4.0
"For my boyfriend's 27th birthday I wanted to take him to a nice steakhouse. He suggested Rustler's Rooste as a nostalgic visit. As a kid, he remembers frequenting the restaurant to celebrate anniversaries, weddings and good company. I was very excited to take him to the restaurant for that purpose and it would be my first visit there. It will also be my last.
When I arrived, a dead fly was on the salad plates that are on the table. When I told the waiter, he seemed rather unphased by the occurrence. I also asked that he provide straws for the water. After being away for some time, he arrived with our drinks and a small kids cup that held the straws. When I picked up the cup, I looked inside to find it was coated with what appeared to be paint chippings and dirt. It was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet. 
Our food arrived, but was left by the cook and we waited for our waiter bit to arrive and serve. I ordered the swordfish and it was very chewy. The steak was okay, certainly not worth the price. My boyfriend had the chicken- he was pleased with the barbeque, but the green beans were cold. The cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper, absolutely horrible. 
I never received a refill, but our waiter was hard to find. He was pretty clueless. I think that reflects more on the restaurant than his skill sets. 
When we left it was a relief. The only reason I will go back is if I am asked to participate on Restaurant Rescue, or to save my unborn child's life.",1.0

"I am reviewing the original Tempe location.  Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(

But nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) 

Soups:
They offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  

Sides: 
The garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  

The mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are ""mushy"" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these ""mushy peas"" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  

The broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. 

All their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  

What differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.  I've had it twice and it was the same both times.

Overall, this is one of the best restaurants in Tempe!",5.0
"Delicious - all of the pasties are great, and I really love the lamb vindaloo one. Ask for a little bit of cucumber and red onion on the side and nibble a little of each with every bite dipped in the yogurt sauce - perfect ^_^ I've been to this one and the one in Scottsdale; this one is great for date nights, while the other location is a little better for families. The food and beer at both are phenomenal!",5.0

"Went here a few years back, I still tell people to this day never to go. I went here after my old dentist retired. They told me I had 15 cavities and the bill was going to be around $4500 and the office assistant at the time could help me set up care credit to pay for it all . I was so upset never had any dentist told me my bill was going to be so outrageously expensive, so I decided to get a second opinion. Well, got a second opinion, the next dentist only wanted to charge $400 for the work. BUT the reason I still tell people to this day to stay away is that when I called the office lady back and told her not to submit my application for the care credit I thought all was fine till I pulled my credit report 6 months later and found that she in fact did not stop the application. I had derogatory reporting that took me another 4 months to fight and dispute it. The office lady submitted the application with my name and social, but with the office address and phone number. So at no point could care credit contact me to let me know that there was a $25 application fee that was never paid. Worst dentist experience ever!",1.0

Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martini's or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isn't better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it! 

We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM!

My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didn't do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay.

I was dragged here by a gf who loves Brew Tea and after my 3rd visit, I didn't want to come back. I never really found a milk tea drink that I liked from here despite adjusting the sweetness down. I told Sou I didn't like their milk tea, Hokkaido milk tea and brew tea so he suggested jasmine milk tea, less sweet. I told him I would think about it and he went ahead and made me a sample! I was immediately hooked. 

The jasmine milk tea is STRONG. It has a very strong tea taste to it, which I love. It was aromatic and perfect in terms of sweetness. Thanks Sou, I can't wait to be back!

Their Hokkaido milk tea is on the sweet side, so if you don't like super sweet I would recommend adjusting it down to a level 3 or even a 2.

"I have been meaning to write a review about my experience here January of 2012. I had not been back there since until my job started ordering from here. Every time we order 1. We ALWAYS have to wait even though our food would be scheduled to be picked up at a certain time and 2.Tthey would always try to charge us different amounts and we would have the same order every time. So, now I am really never returning. But, back to last January.....

There were 15 of us for our friends birthday party. His fiance called and made the reservations and even called earlier that day to make sure they still had us down for 15 people at 9PM. They said everything was scheduled and they would see us later. We waited for about 1 hour and a half for our table and were not seated til @ 10:30. When we got to our table it was only set up for 12 people. We moved the table around and asked other tables for chairs with no help from the staff. We waited for a bit to get our drinks. Some people even went to the bar since it was taking a little while. Our waitress asked us to all fill out a sushi form even if we were not getting sushi and that is how she would take our orders. We all filled out our forms and turned them in. She brought out the appetizers and forgot one couples Edamame. She eventually brought it out. Then she brought out our entrees. Meanwhile, getting refills on our drinks was nearly impossible.  She brought everyone's meals out. I asked about mine. She went into the back to check on it, came out about 5 minutes later and told me "" I forgot to put your ticket in but the kitchen is closed now so you can't get any food. I am sorry"" and walked away. So, I NEVER RECEIVED A MEAL!!! My husband and our friends shared with me. Our friends fiance went to the hostess stand and complained to the manager. She was told a complimentary bottle of Champagne would be brought to the table and we would all be discounted on our tickets. Then, without asking if we wanted deserts or coffee, our waitress brings our checks. We told her about the discount and champagne. She said the manager never told her. She took our tickets back and came back about 20 minutes later. Our ticket and the couple with the late edamame had the discounts. Everyone else's was full price and one of our friends just didn't get a bill!  We never received the Champagne and the manger never came to our table.

Needless to say this was not a pleasant experience and I have seen the same waitress there when I go to pick up food for work. Based on other reviews for this location it does not appear that things have changed either. Do not recommend going to this restaurant. The OK food is not worth the bad service.",1.0
God for the half price night and order some calamari. Other than that there is way better sushi around this part of town.,2.0
"What a terrible experience!
Replay bad customer service, I didn't get to try the food because after they ask me to move from one table to another table, I decided not to take any more risk and left the restaurant.",1.0
"Le Reve is a phenomenal show!  

The performance blended aerial stunts with high diving with synchronized swimming with acrobatics.  There were performers coming up from under the water, down from the ceiling and up and down stairs and platforms.  

Every section has equal view, as all the seats circle around the stage, and the performers are on all sides.  However, two of the staff at Wynn, in separate conversations, had mentioned row G was the best, as you are in the middle of everything above and below you (that was where we ended up sitting, and it was perfect)

They sell this package deal where you can sit in recliners, and get champagne and truffles...but upon seeing the venue, it really didn't seem worth the extra money to sit in those seats.  They are all the way up, so you are looking down on the whole show, vs the feeling of submersion with the regular seats.",5.0
"We were here a few times today while in town unexpectedly. My hubby stopped in first and overheard an all-staff meeting centered around how they can I improve their customer service. We both stopped in a bit later for a drink at the wine bar. I was enchanted with being able to eat sushi, get a glass of wine or beer, free cheese pairings, and the like. 

Several hours later I couldn't find a jacket I had brought on our trip. I retraced my steps and figured I left it at the wine bar, so I called the grocery store and asked. The woman who answered said no one had turned in a jacket today. I asked - really? Could you check at the wine bar? She asked me what time I was there and then informed me that they would have already turned it to her since it was ""so long ago"" (6 hrs). 

My husband and I proceeded to tear apart our hotel room and unpack all our luggage, to no avail. He went back to the grocery store and there was my jacket at the wine bar. 

He went to the customer service desk to show the woman with whom I spoke. She told him that she was ""busy when she spoke to me"". Too busy to transfer me to the wine bar, or take a number and call me back, apparently. Customer service still leaves something to be desired, even after a staff meeting about it.",3.0
"The girls who scheduled were very helpful in getting me a 1 hour window for the techs arrival.  They followed up the morning of to let me know the tech was on his way.  Patrick arrived and was very pleasant and easy to work with.  Diagnosed the issue very quickly, but took the time to do it right.  Also advised me on new appliances and what to look for, etc.  Overall great experience and would recommend Patrick and American Air anytime",5.0
"Some friends and I decided to take a random road trip to Toronto back in January. As we were roaming around the streets stopping into pubs, a random female tells us to walk a few blocks and check out the Village Idiot Pub. This was by far the best advice we received all weekend. Our server, let's call him Marlin because none of us can remember his real name, was very knowledgeable about all the beers in terms of how and where they were brewed and flavor notes to be picked up. I was also extremely impressed that the bar would not serve a beer if they did not have the proper glass. Beyond all of this, Marlin was simply a cool guy. 

We had a few rounds, and got some great advice from Marlin on other bars to check out during our short excursion. I would rate this one of the best bars that we visited over our fast weekend. I would definitely come back to Toronto just to stop into the Village Idiot and have a beer with Marlin!",5.0
They serve these tender turkey ribs with this sauce.....really that's all you need.  They routinely sell out.....so call ahead.  Tip: grab a bottle of local made wine to wash it all down.,4.0
This place deserves 2 stars because one time me and my friend got out of school so we went to use the restroom right when we came out this lady yelled at us and told us to leave because they said there was graffiti and I don't even no how to graffiti and I would never do it because it's wrong so me and my friend left and the lady said we have to use the family restroom so I would go to use the family restroom after school a couple months later they put a sign so I couldn't use that one so I had to find somewhere else to use the restroom or I would call my parents to pick me up sometimes I even had to make up excuses to go to the nurse just to use the restroom. One time I went swimming with my family and they didn't let wear goggles that block my nose  so I took care of my younger cousin because if water gets in my nose I start coughing and my nose starts to burn so bad I also think the showers should be more private I was about to shower when this guy opens the curtain and sees me washing off I got so furious I actually turned off the water and stormed off and left to go back outside and went to take care of my younger cousin I plan to go in a month hope to see older people instead of teenagers watching out for us they probably don't have a lot if experience and hope they are nicer,2.0
"Beach Cafe, what can I say (haha that rhymed). I have always been weary of trying new places, I mean I love doing it but at the same time you're always scared it's a miss. But considering it was in walking distance and I was in Vegas this is the place to try new places. Me and my friend walked to here and from the get go it's a nice little cafe. Plenty of seating, and everyone is pretty friendly. There menu is nice, I mean I wish they were in Cali where the beaches are. It makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast/lunch place we have here. But at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when I come back. Me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here. I ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon. And their iced coffee. I'll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down, but it did its job and it's free refills. Their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too. I did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too. I mean I wish I had tried more variety but I'm kind of a plain jane kind of guy. The cafe breakfast ended up being my go to, and I'm not a huge breakfast person. They also have specials here and there. They had a captain crunch French toast that was to die for . The prices were fair, I usually ended up paying about 10 for my food and drink. On top of it if you're the type to frequent this place. Ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about I believe 10 or 12 meals. But hey, free food is always good.",5.0
"I agree with Karen L.  This SDM is closer to Spadina so it's one of the easier access places to get snacks and drinks before going to the dome for a game.  

It has a bit of an industrial look with exposed ceilings but with new shiny floors yet it's still bright enough and organized without having to be overly white in color with overkill white light either.  

It's deceivingly large inside and is better looking than most Shoppers stores.  With the same products and even groceries while in a good location?  That's a win.",3.0
"So in my search for something that was good an luxurious I came across Mastro's (weird name, one want to think Maestro's non?). I reserved a table and the plan was to go there, have drinks and then sit down for dinner before we head out into the weird Old Town of Scottsdale. 

We came and the girls up front was very accommodating and since we were early they tried to seat us quickly. Very nice and they really didn't have to, but still nice. I must say the drinks were ok. I felt the style and flair was on par but the quality wasn't just there. This was the overall opinion in my party. 

We sat down and our waiter was funny yet professional He could not be stumped. And as we put in our orders, the evening continued. Then we had a good conversation with a very passive aggressive sommelier about what wine we felt we wanted. A sommelier shouldn't be a yes-man (or woman in this case) but not have such snobbish attitude when asked a few questions. I was surprised about this. Very.

We had fun and we ate and we drank. We all had steaks. Decent in size and quality. And here is the most amazing thing of all.. the meat was tender, but very salty. I immediately suspected tenderizing methods - which in all actuality is beneath an establishment like this.

The establishment itself is very nice... a bit loud, but very beautiful and stylish. 

In the end we had a good time and the service was amazing... but the sommelier and the quality of the meats was not up to snuff. There was a few sides that was also very plain. I guess I just expected more. I will go to another place next time. There was just too many things that didn't feel right with this place.",3.0
"My son broke the screen on his ""new"" Samsung Galaxy smart phone.  Given it has a touch-screen, I had assumed that it was irrepairable.  On a whim, I decided to stop-in to Quick Mobile Repair after seeing their street sign on the SE-corner of Cave Creek and Union Hills Road.  Nick Fazio has a small shop set up in the back of a local smoke shop, but don't let his humble operation mislead you.  He was able to repair my son's smart phone for less than $80 parts and labor and it is good-as-new.  Nick was professional, low-pressure, and confident in his ability to fix the phone.  He even loaned my son a ""loaner phone"" while he worked on my son's phone.  It took several days given Nick had to special-order the repair parts, but I was just grateful he was able to fix it.

If you need a cell phone repaired, talke to Nick Fazio.  He does amazing work!",5.0

"WTH?! I walked in last night w/ my wife and saw they'd done a little reno and re-did the menu. Prices went up, portions went down, taste and quality went out the window, and now this place is not the place I went to when it first opened. The bacon on her chicken club wasn't warmed up so it was definitely not freshly cooked. My Philly cheesesteak was pretty light on cheese, steak and taste. It also reminded me why I shouldn't order cheesesteaks outside of Philly. Save your money unless you want a quick bite and are too drunk to taste anything. The new portions definitely make it a quick bite.",1.0
"Went for Happy hour. Good menu and prices. 1/2 off for apps. Beer selection was a little weak.

Had the Buttermilk Chicken Sliders which were good. Flavorful chicken and a complimentary sauce. Pickles adding a nice zing to the overall taste.

Also had Firecracker Shrimp. WOW!!!! This was what did it for me. Awesome flavor, great burst of peppery taste with the sauce. Nothing too hot but had just enough heat to enhance the shrimp. This is a must order when you go!!!!!!",4.0
"While the place may turn you off or make you hesitate to go in, the food is FANTASTIC.... and reasonably priced. We have not had a bad meal there yet !  The steak special - yep - just be sure to get your Casino card first. Too bad they don't include the beer or root beer anymore.  When we arrive in Vegas, we drop off our bags and walk over to Ellis.  I get the steak special and my spouse gets the Shrimp Scampi. Breakfast is great.  My only complaint would be sometimes it is slow getting the food to you.  We found this place because the Locals all praised it.",5.0
"Was in Las Vegas on business for a week so and was busy so really did not spend time on the ""strip"" but believe me there are some really nice restaurants and hotels just off the strip that are as good or better than ones on the strip.  I will write a few reviews and this is one.  I was at the Tuscany Hotel and Casino, about 2 Las Vegas blocks (I think a LV block is about  1/2 mile) off Las Vegas Blvd (Flamingo and Ballys corner) on Flamingo Ave.

OK Ellis Island Casino is about 1 LV block from Tuscany Hotel and same from Flamingo.  I found this when I was asking where locals go.... It is an older place and is attached to a Days Inn I think.  It is relatively small place with a couple of BJ tables, slots, craps etc.   They have a big rectangular bar and they make their own craft beer (+1).  A beer is $2.50, which on the strip will be 5-10 each.  I love the amber beer.  Also when a football game is being televised, beer is only $1!! 

They had a small club where Karaoke is on most nights I think.. .have been there and that was fun also.  Now what I really like is the restaurant for a good cheap meal.  They have a special that is a good size steak (thick like a filet but not the same quality but very good), potato, vegetable and a salad for $9.99.  Last year it was $8.99 and included a beer so that was a little disappointing.  To get the special you have to join the players club, which is no cost and like all players clubs at casinos you get points and sometimes free rooms.

I had lunch there on Wednesday and decided to have the $5.99 breakfast.  It was unbelievable... I have never had a meal where I thought... this is too much bacon!!! .. the potatoes were awesome, more bacon than I needed and rye toast was great.   My friend had a burger that was very good and huge.  See the pics.
 
I give them a 4+ for the food and beer at reasonable prices and the down home atmosphere.  If you are in LV and want to get off the beaten path for a great meal, stop here.  I will warn you that you will have to wait during dinner time.",4.0
"I went in with a few friends to try it as it boldly advertises a great breakfast experience and some of the best eggs benedict in LV. I would say not. One friend had it and they were mediocre at best. My waffle was soggy, not cooked enough and drowning under too much whipped cream and fruit. Another friend ordered something that was a little too spicy, and with a lot of hesitation sent it back for something else. If you've watched Waiting or work in food service it's obvious why the hesitation. So they sent her out something so hot it burned her mouth and the workers in the kitchen were watching her and laughed to themselves. I know that may sound a little dramatic, but both my other friend and I saw it happen and I had to hold him back from going back there and laying someone out. The waitress actually had to apologize to us about the behavior of their staff. That's inexcusable, the whole incident never should have happened and says a lot about who they hire and how they train them. I wouldn't have come back here anyway just based on the food, but with the service issues they don't have to worry about me or my friends as repeat customers. Avoid this place, there are several much better places in the area, from Skinny Fats to Waffles Cafe to Baby Stacks. Norm's is a joke.",1.0
Arrived here at the MGM today for my daughters wedding and so disappointed with our room.  We had requested a strip view and was thrilled at check in to find out that we were upgraded to a strip room but it was still being cleaned. After waiting for an hour and a half I asked if my room was ready and they said no but they could put me in a mountain view room right away and I said I would rather wait for the strip view. Finally my room was ready and was disappointed that it was a view of the airport!!!! After making several calls they would not accommodate me.  I just don't get it.,1.0
"Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Been here for 2 days and haven't been able to sleep at all. The beds are uncomfortable, the pillows suck, and the walls are paper thin. Ive been hearing the neighbors next door which seems to be a zoo full of monkey. It's impossible to sleep. There is no hot water so I've been freezing trying to shower as quickly as possible with that cold water. The tub took 15 minutes to drain so that was annoying too. No coffee in the room and they wanted to charge us an extra $35 a night for a fridge. For a ""5 star"" hotel it's definitely a let down. Being unable to fix our shower they switched our room and this one is not any better. The sink doesn't drain and the we got some nasty stained towels.",1.0
"Most of the products from their menu were delicious. It has been 3 years since I came here last time, I love this place but I do not live in this area. This time I ordered 4 items:

Black Sesame soup - a traditional dessert which people said it is good for your health. I do recommend eat it while it is warm. Very smooth and strong sesame taste.

Full house sago - the fantastic！My favorite dessert made with fresh diced mango, pomelo and evaporated milk sand sago. Not too sweet.  

Durian pancake - a must - try item from Full House desserts. Real durian with whip cream inside of the omelette. The omelette was thin and smooth. You have to hold it carefully on hand, otherwise, you will destroy a piece of artwork.

Durian black glutinous rice - it surprised me the most. I did not expect the actual durain ball inside. Sweetness just right. The black glutinous rice add texture into it and make me want to keep eating it.",5.0

"Good healthy option in Phoenix.  Lots of vegan, vegetarian and healthy options.  It's a self-service place - you wait in line to put in your order, find a table, bring the number to your table and someone brings out your food to your table.

I had the vegan scramble with the sweet potato hash.  The vegan scramble was scrambled tofu with tumeric - it was DELICIOUS.  The sweet potato hash was a bit strange at first but very tasty.

Rosemary potatoes were also delicious.  And the whole wheat toast is great - not the generic supermarket quality but a good hearty bread.

The capuchino that I got for free for checking in on Foursquare was delicious (very strong). However, the one negative on this place is that their drip coffee is atrocious - I mean, it tasted like water.  Literally. I tried the Italian and the decaf and both were watery - no taste at all.  I hope that today it was just an off day, because given how tasty everything else is and the fact that they are a brunch place that coffee quality would be so poor.",4.0
"Made my way out to Scramble this past Sunday with my lady..

Place is not what I imagined...you place your order, sit down, and food is brought to you in 5-10 minutes.

Outdoor seating is great and dog friendly, and a nice little mountain view.

While my french toast was great, the pancakes were solid...but the breakfast burrito stole the show. The Costa Burrito to be exact, highly recommended!

This is a must go to breakfast spot. Friendly staff, comfy seating, great views and great vibes!",5.0
"Pho for lunch! People asked me why I had pho as the first meal in Toronto, well, that becomes a mystery. Who knows. I just entered this place and feel the decor is welcoming. And I need a place to rest a bit. This did not disappoint me. Simple and healthy. Yes, healthy but good taste. I had the lunch special: beef pho with spring rolls. 

The place is neat and tidy, and the food looks so too. The green bean sprouts looked like organic ones as they are kinda thin. The taste is a bit bitter however I liked it. 

The ingredients taste and look fresh and good, the soup is light but flavorful. I like it that way. 

I sat towards the kitchen, so I can really see them preparing the food. The decor is nice and high tables and stools were good to relax my feet. But the stool may fall somehow. 

In summary, good place for a quick, warm and healthy meal.",4.0
"I have literally had a better cheesesteak and fries from more than one college cafeteria. 

Have fun biting into (admittedly good) bread half the time while the meager portion of steak crumbles fly out everywhere. The absolutely plain fries aren't going to save you from disappointment. I ordered the ""bomb steak"" which is unique in that it for some reason uses pickled peppers.  And regarding this beef...it's cool that you're chopping it up, but annoying that no one meal preps, and as a result all you hear is the clanging of a metal spatula on the grill over all other activity for the entirety of your meal. You can take it easy, as all that pulverizing completely kills the texture. This is probably an exaggeration, but they might be able to replace it with ground beef, and no one will be the wiser. 

Other than that, I do appreciate the charm of this place. The brick walls and cozy design tell you it's one of the older buildings in midtown. The ubiquitous coca cola ads--on the table, the umbrellas over the outdoor seating, etc.--take me back to a time in which being mainstream and average was a-ok. Times have changed, but this place clearly has not. And I respect that. I hope it continues for 20 more. It'll probably do so just fine without my business, which it is unlikely to receive again.",2.0
Being a huge Disney fan I was stoked when this store opened so close to our house. My daughter especially loves going in and looking at all the stuff.The prices really aren't much less than a regular Disney store. Which is strange. But the staff there is awesome.

"My husband and I returned to Ilios Noche, as we do nearly every year, to celebrate our anniversary last night. Having honeymooned in Greece, Ilios Noche for many years was the closest we found in Charlotte to the food we ate there.

We were sat promptly for our 6:45 reservation. We called ahead to inquire about corkage fees, and found that there is no corkage fee for the first bottle of wine you bring to Ilios Noche, and a $15 fee for every bottle thereafter. For us, and our one bottle of wine that we have saved since 2007 to drink, it was a great deal!

Erika was our server, and she was fantastic at her job. We didn't want for anything. The food was spectacular. I ordered the Greek style pork ribs, and my husband ordered a lamb dish with orzo. The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, and easily eaten with a fork. Very tender, smoky and lightly flavored. We also ordered a sampler of all the dips (htipiti, hummus, tzatziki and an eggplant dip) as an appetizer. They brought us multiple pita bread refills until we'd conquered the appetizer, for which we were very appreciative!  Everything about our meal was perfect. I've been looking forward to the leftover ribs for lunch all morning!

Ilios Noche is expanding in a couple of weeks which hopefully helps with the space concerns noted in other reviews. Erika told us they hope to stay open through Mother's Day, doing construction on ""the other side"" of the soon-to-come-down wall in order to minimize their downtime. The sign at the restaurant said they're expecting to host a grand re-opening in June.

I highly recommend Ilios Noche, and learning about the free corkage on the first bottle of wine last night really puts them up there on places I'd recommend in Charlotte.",5.0

"I was watching a James Bond movie last night and began to wonder what sort of torture it would take to make me spill....

""So Ms. M, you won't tell us the formula, eh?  We have ways of making you talk!  Oddjob!  Take her Manolo Blahniks!""  The huge henchman wrenched  my 4th favorite pair of shoes off my feet.  I grimaced, but wouldn't say a word.

""Still won't talk?  Fetch the Nine West shoes!""

""You wouldn't!""  I gasped, letting my guard down.  Luckily for me the the shoddy Nine West knockoff of a Prada design fell apart in his hands, as did the pathetic Steve Madden pair her produced afterward.  I arched one eyebrow and smirked. 

""So smug, are we Ms. M?  Fetch the Sketchers!!!!""  he shouted.

""You expect me to wear Sketchers?""  I asked.

""No, Ms. M, I expect you to die!""  

I screamed as Oddjob forced the worst possible footwear on my trembling foot.

I can't abide bad shoes.  However, my taste exceeds my budget, so I make regular pilgrimages to Off 5th.  There I can find some of my favorite brands-- Delman, Stuart Weitzman, Dior, Kate Spade, YSL and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for a mere fraction of their regular prices.  (Sorry no Trinity- Manolo, Louboutin or Jimmy)  Sign up for their e-mail/ mailing list and you will get advance notices of sales and extra percentage off coupons.

Their designer clothes section is fabulous as well.  It requires some diligent picking, but Escada, St. John, Valentino and Ungaro can be had for a fraction of their regular price.  There is an entire section of Tahari.  There are also deep discounts on Joe Jeans and Saks' house brands.

Examples:
Kate Spade black patent slingback kitten heels:  regular $300, I paid $30.
YSL black patent d'orsay 4.5 inch stilettos:  $780, I paid $80
Dior 5 inch platform suede round toed stilettos: regular $720, I paid $125
Escada houndstooth silk wrap dress:  regular $1,800, I paid $430
Ungaro silk and linen skirt: regular $350, I paid $60
I also find Delmans and Stewart Weitzmans which run from $250-$350 for under $100.

"Our stay at hooters was okay. While I don't have anything ""wow"" to say about the hotel I do appreciate them having free wifi.
However there were several things that I was not okay with and were deal breakers in me visiting this hotel again.

There was no sign available to hang at the door and when I asked a housekeeping lady for one she reply that she didn't have one. Our room was not cleaned the first night which I honestly didn't care much except we needed new towels.

But the two things that bothered me the most is that staff opened the doors TWICE without knocking and we had to scream that we were in there. The first time I think it was housekeeping it was around 9am, but I couldn't check.
The second time I called because the hair dryer did not work, I called main desk and they said they would send me another one which I was okay with but instead a maintiqnce guy came in without knocking to ""fix"" the dryer. I ended up putting my hair up and before I left the maintiance man said he would have to replace it.",2.0

Not as good as the one at Four Peaks, but definitely not far behind. My mom got a burger and said it was really good. Prices on beer were great during this time, I got a pitcher for $6.

My cousin got the Sinful 7 cake and I had to refrain from eating it all when she let me try it, my friend got the Rocky Road brownie which was also decadent and delicious, and my Berry Crème Brule was outstanding.

"Big dogs has amazing food, everything I've had here has been delicious! The servers at this particular location are TERRIBLE though. The first time I went here, my sister and I stood at the host stand for more than 10 minutes waiting for someone to sit us in the dining area. They weren't even remotely busy. Had a few of them walk by us and didn't do anything. Finally someone seats us, but we still waited forever for someone to come take our order. Once that happens we are again finding ourselves waiting and waiting and waiting. Almost 20 minutes later they come and tell us they hadn't put the ticket in (didn't say anything during the long wait because I already figured the service was going to be slow) So she offers to buy our appetizer and finally has our order in. I decided to go there again with my sister and a friend,  because it's close and like I said, the food is awesome. The wait at the host stand wasn't long this time but the wait for food and ordering were still slow. The server brought us the check and I asked her to split it for us, sounds easy enough.

The food isn't amazing, they use the same chicken regardless of the dish, and the drinks cost what you would pay on the strip.

"I'm totally on board with the concept of this restaurant, and I think that this particular location is done really well. It's clean, with modern decor and furniture. Went here for Saturday lunch, and all the employees were really warm and welcoming. 
Our food in particular was actually pretty delicious for what it was. I ordered the Souvlaki Pita, and the pork was just a tad overdone, but the flavor was all there and proportion of ingredients was spot on. Their pita really is pretty damn good. 

I don't have too much to say about a fast food place, but I left happy and full. As for the health aspect that I think everybody is harping on, it all seems to depend on what you order. I think I lucked out by getting one of the healthier options, but there seems to be a ton you can indulge on here (ahem, my mother ordering the banana pudding...)",4.0

"Sun valley stereo exceeded my expectations with excellent service, knowledge and attention to detail.  Not only are the people great but they have a large inventory and excellent demo area where you can hear exactly what you'll get before you buy.  The price isn't bargain basement for installation but the quality and craftsmanship are astounding.  

I highly recommend Sun Valley Stereo if you're at all serious about car audio.  

My experience was exceptional.  I dealt with Ryan over the phone initially after picking out components for my new stereo system on my new wrx.  I ordered a head unit, amp and speakers from amazon.com.  The crew there installed the stereo without a problem and I was able to keep my steering wheel controls.  Unfortunately the head unit that I ordered from Amazon was defective.   They packed up the head unit I purchased from Amazon and replaced it with an identical one from their own stock.  The installation was done very professionally.   I'm extremely satisfied with the clean and tidy results and the sound quality of the new car audio system.

Kudos to  sun valley stereo.  I recommend them to anyone who will listen.",5.0
"I have been have multiple times and will keep coming back! The service here is outstanding! My daughter wanted to have a group of 30 join us for a special occasion and the staff was awesome! From the manager, who closed off a section of the patio just for us and confirmed our reservation, right down to the server (Mike I believe) were all amazing. Even with the larger group the food was hot and delicious not to mention the speed at which they served us. 

The food came out all within a couple minutes of each other which isn't easy considering the size of our party. If you have been to any of the My Big Fat Greek Restaurants you will be impressed by the service here. The size of this location is a little smaller than the one in Mesa but it has a more date or adult atmosphere, which is a nice change from the loud chain places.

The food here is fantastic!!! You must try the Greek Fries & the Tyrokafteri...

"I will never return again. You lost a customer. This would have been my 4th visit to the salon. After trying all weekend to make an appointment for my mother and self I finally got a call Tuesday morning 12/10 the day I wanted my appointment. Made the appointment for 1 and the receptionist said she would have her other girl shanell come in early so we could both have a stylist. Upon arrival shanell sat me down and asked me what I wanted done. When I started to explain the color I wanted she said ""whoa whoa I thought you just wanted a cut. Hold on"" she went to the front (where my mother was waiting to be called back) and checked what the receptionist wrote, then my mother heard the receptionist say that I had told her I only wanted a cut. LIAR. Then shanell went to the back and started complaining to whoever was in the back and after a few minutes finally came back to me. She said ""I can color your hair, maybe cut it, but I don't have time for anything else so you can just sit under the dryer. I came in early to help you out and I just don't have time"" we decided against it and left. Clearly your employees mistakes are my fault and I should feel bad for her having to come in early?

"Always had good service at Discount Tire in Scottsdale 85251. ALWAYS! 
This Discount in Avondale in the 85392 not so much. I drive a distance to work & have had some (2) tire repairs at this Discount in Avondale in the last 12 months & the experience while painfully slow was fine. Nothing to write home about but S-L-O-W. 
My husband takes my car for a purchase of 2 new tires, a rotation & yet another nail plug. 3rd repair of different 3 tires & it was def not the charm. 
The tire they ""repaired"" blew on the I-10 S. at the curve near 36th St. in 4 p.m. traffic on a Monday. 
So it's back to the Discount after losing 1.5 hours on a Monday mid day like I said S-L-O-W. Chuck whom worked on the previous plug offered the hubs a new tire for the trouble & sends him on his way after another 60 minutes. 
Only for him to turn out onto 99th ave. 1/8 of a block maybe to have the sensor that tells you the tire is low come on. But not only come on but blink. Never have we seen a blink on that sensor. The front desk jockey (they are closed now btw he was the last car) tell him his ""battery is low"". The hubs insists that someones going to look at it. So the hubs watches as the front desk jockey goes across the bays to grab Chuck the guy that worked on it. Chuck calls over another tech not a manager & goes over to the car. The hubs meets them & Chuck bends over the closest tire to him & says to the hubs your sensor is broken. We'll have to order you another & it will be in by 2 p.m. tomorrow. We'll pay for it & install it. So basically Chuck is either clairvoyant since there was no inspection or he let the hubs leave knowing he had broken the sensor. Don't get me wrong crap happens. Everybody has a bad day. I get that. But not to take responsibility at all. Not to involve a manager is just ridiculous & shows a lack of character on both the tech & the hiring staff. I get to return to this establishment not today (because the part didn't come in) but soon & get a sensor fixed by a company I no longer trust nor can I recommend after 11+ years of service in Scottsdale.

"Wow.  This could not have gone worse. 

1.  I called and asked if they did acupuncture. The nurse assured me that they did. Turns out not to be true - The ahem doctor literally waived a green light in my ear for 10 -12 seconds and claimed that was the acupuncture session.
2. I asked if my insurance would cover the visit - they took my details and said yes, my plan included coverage with a $30 co pay.  NOT TRUE - today, 3 months later,  i received a statement for $70 because my insurance would not cover it.  When I called to ask why they had told me it was covered, the office manager said that because she was out of the office when I made the appointment and visited, she was not responsible for any promises made to me in her absence. I kid you not, she actually said that.  
3.  I showed up for the visit, waited 45 minutes because the regular office manager was out of the office and the ahem doctor's new Ukrainian bride was managing the office.  
4.  Finally, the ahem doctor walked into the consultation room, had me lie down on the bed and fed 6  or 7 chemicals into my mouth.  When i said I specifically called ahead for acupuncture treatment, he then shone the magic green light in my ear for 1- to 12 seconds and declared the visit over.  
5. He did insist that I came back every day for the next few days for my treatment of tenis elbow and tried to coerce me into confirming an appointment for the next day despite my mentioning that I would be out of town.  Clearly not a good listener.  He said it was vital to my treatment that I purchase the powders he had dropped on my tongue during treatment.
6. Upon checking out, they insisted I needed to buy 6 bottles of magic chemicals for $200.
7. Three months later I just received a bill for the additional $70 that they assured me was covered by my insurance.  
In my personal opinion, my treatment was completely unhelpful and the alleged acupuncture I went there for did not exist. I believe they blatantly lied to me about the acupuncture treatment",1.0

"Went to Zakkushi (@ZakkushiCarlton) around 2 weeks ago when it  just open and they didn't even had a sign up or liquor license yet. Zakkushi is a Japanese Style pub with 3 successful Vancouver locations has recently open it's door on Carlton St.


The restaurant is best know for it's kushiyaki (skewer meat) cooked over binchotan which is a white smokeless charcoal made from Japanese Oak
It's mid size with around 70-80 seats

 Appetizer Sampler $5.80 any 3 (or $3-$3.5 each)
Shiokara ~ Marinated squid w/ special Shiokara Sauce
Hotaruika ~ Marinated fresh baby squid w/ soy sauce
 Goma-ae ~ Boiled spinach w/ sesame sauce

 Goma-ae $4.60
~ Deep Fried chicken knee cartilage
~ Love soft bone but the batter here was rather bland and soft (wish it was crispier)

 Original Oden w/  choice of 5 toppings $6.80
~ Daikon, Takenoko (Bamboo shoot), Tofu, Ikamaki (Fish cake stuffed w/ squid)
& Konnyaku (Yam cake)
~ This was really flavorful, probably one of the yummiest I had in Toronto. I usually don't like yam cake but this was was really good, the perfect texture and perfect with the broth. Even the daikon and tofu are really well cook/marinated which was perfect since the broth although flavorful was on the light side.

 Premium Set $19.80 & Zakkushi Set $8.80
~ By getting the set you save a bit compare to ordering separately, thought it was a good idea to try some of their signature skewers since it was our first time here.

 Premium Set $19.80
Wagyu Beef ~ wagyu beef skewer w/ Oropon Sauce ($6.8/ea)
Premium Beef Tongue ~ thick cut beef tongue w/ salt & pepper ($4.2/ea)
Free Range Chicken Momo ~ Free Range chicken tight w/ salt ($3.2/ea)
Wagyu Beef Tsukune (sauce) ~ wagyu beef meat ball ($3.5/ea)
Unagi ~ Eel w/ terriyaki sauce & Sansho pepper ($5.8/ea)

Although the Wagyu beef was really good and you could definitely taste the difference compare to the regular beef skewer that they have, I don't know if I am willing to pay $6.80 for one skewers.
I actually didn't really like the thick cut beef tongue since it was so thick, it tasted like beef.... while there was really nothing special about the meat balls and unagi. The chicken momo was the one that stood out here, it was perfectly cook, moist and the meat itself was so flavorful.

 Zakkushi Set $8.80
Oropon Beef ~ w/ grated Daikon $ Ponzu sauce ($2.4/ea)
P-toro ~ Crunchy & juicy pork ($1.8/ea)
Me Maki ~ Garlic stubs wrapped w/ pork ($1.9/ea)
Momo (sauce)~ Chicken tight ($1.6/ea)
Umeshiso Yaki ~ Chicken thight w/ sour plum & Japanese basil ($1.9/ea)

Given it's price compare to the first set, everything here was surprisingly good.
I was impress at how thin the pork was for Me Maki that was wrapped around the garlic stubs which make it extra crispy. I also really like the sour plum sauce on the umeshiso yaki which make it a bit different.

 Yakioni (Shoyu or Butter Shoyu) $1.8/ea
~ Grilled rice ball w/ a choice of soy sauce or butter soy sauce
~ I love this one and yes I can never go without carbs for long (love my rice/noodle/bread).
~ Love this crispy goodness, just like the crispy rice bottom of Chinese Rice pot or Korean BiBimBap.
~ Tried both flavor and I like the Shoyu better since you can taste the rice flavor better.
~ I loved it so much that I had a 2nd

 Ankimo $5.2
~ Cold Monkfish liver (Japanese Foie Gras style)
~ This was the probably the only thing I didn't like that night.... it was rather bland tasting, it needs more sauce (sour /salty)

 Shishito $1.9
~ Twist pepper w/ soy sauce & bonito flakes
 Chicken Heart $1.6
~I actually prefer the Chinese/Mongolian heart skewer version better...
 Kawa $1.6 & Taba $1.9
~ Chicken Skin (salt) & Chicken wing
~ Both are really good, perfect crispy skin... nom nom nommm
 Cheese Mochi Maki $2.4
~ Sticky rice wrapped w/ pork & melted cheese
~ Had always love sticky rice cake and this was even better with fatty pork and cheese
~ Need to try make something like that at home ;)

The bamboo cup thing was to hold your finished skewers and that how many the 2 of us ate =P

 Dorayaki Matcha Ice Cream $3.5
~ matcha ice cream and red bean in Japanese pancake
~ Ben insisted to order this and I warned him that the pancake is probably store bought and will be dry... and I was right.

 Kinako Mochi Ice Cream $3.8
~ soy powder sprinkle vanilla ice cream & sticky rice w/ maple syrup
~ Love love love this, instead of the regular mochi it was warm toasted sticky rice cake which had a crispy exterior and super sticky gooyee interior.... and was perfect w/ the cold ice cram while the soy powder just push it up a notch. 

 Verdict :
~ Try not to order everything at once since almost everything came at the same time and some dishes just got cold by the time we ate it.
~ Love all the variety of skewers to choose from
~ Can't wait to go back and have everything with a beer or sake (they got their LLBO)",4.0
"I came here today initially to get shots in my masseter (Botox) as I have TMJ and my dentist suggested a while back to get Botox as relaxes the muscle and calms the pain and clenching at night which can help get rid of my migraines. Anyways, my first appointment was canceled as I was en-route at the doctor was called away on an emergency. I was super bummed and had spent the cab fare to get downtown , I had emailed them to find out the next time I could come and they gave me $50 off my treatment PLUS $20 reimbursement for cab fare! So awesome of them. It was a tad hard to find at first,  it's in the Royal York hotel. They have 2 areas upstairs is for surgery and downstairs is for injectables. Glenda took me upstairs to meet the doctor first, just because I was a first timer at their clinic. After answering standard questions I went into the treatment room. Glenda was so informative , eased my mind about some fear I had about injecting into the jaw, she was so knowledgeable, gentle with the needles (I've had doctors who are really rough, not fun) I completely recommend them, the area is clean, modern and fresh looking, they are all super friendly and easy to talk to.

"This review is pending for two weeks now, so fellow Yelpers, my apologies. 

My friend and I were deciding which Mexican restaurant to dine in on a Friday night. Granted my friend is a big foodie, and as usual I always don't judge his suggestions or recommendations. We were going to try out El Catrin, but instead we decided to go dine at La Carnita. 

This is my first proper Mexican restaurant in the GTA/Toronto area. I've been to few good ones in the US - primarily L.A., Las Vegas and Washington, DC. Upon entering, I was kind of overwhelmed with the atmosphere. It was more catered to a more ""younger"" crowd, and it was more of a trendy place, compared to the Mexican restaurants I've been to in the US. 

We were greeted by the hostess, and were given a high top table to sit at. That evening it was cold, and I was looking to see where we can place our jackets, since we sat on stools. Sure you could sit on your jacket, but some may oppose to it. We asked the hostess, and she kindly said that there are hooks under the table, and we can hang it there. I was impressed, as I've never come across this concept before. 

Okay - time to get to the food part. Right? I was glancing through the menu and my friend and I decided to order the tortilla chips with the 3 dips (guacamole, corn salsa and spicy bean & smoked queso). For the main course, or rather the tacos, I ordered to the crispy cotija. Mind you, I only ordered 1 of that, but I'll get to that later. We waited about 10 minutes for our tortilla chips and I must say - first impressions are always key. The presentation and portion was fantastic. If I wasn't feeling hungry that night, I probably would have had this only for dinner heh. The chips were frish, not stale. They were crispy, and they tasted great with the dips. All the dips were fantastic, and I tried resisting to pick the remaining dips with my fingers and to lick it. It was that good, but I didn't want to act like an animal, or should I say - a cave man. 

Onto the tacos themselves. Right, so like I said, I've never been to this kind of Mexican restaurant before, or rather where I've ordered tacos. I didn't know by ordering 1, I would only get one taco. I thought the tacos came in multiple quantities, but hey the price was too good to be true at $4.91 for this. I then ordered 2 more, to make it 3. Didn't have to wait long for it, and I just downed the tacos all at once. Yes I said all at once! I didn't even bother to care who was looking at me. I am a hungry dude, who needs to satisfy my stomach. I probably caved into my cave man instincts and just went haywire. To the point these were so good, I ended up ordering more. The server gave me a look, and told me that I should probably stop. I know he meant good, but I politely told him that I need MORE! No I am not a glutton, or at least I think I am. 

By the time I was done, I was satisfied, ensured my hands were no longer messy, and I gave out a semi loud burp. Probably the couple beside us would have heard it, but eh - who cares right? *shifts eyes*

Overall here's my ranking. The higher the number, the better. 

1) Ambiance - 3.5/5 - not a fan of the non well lit area, the music was kind of loud to have a conversation with. 

2) Food - 4/5 - not getting sick or not getting food poison is a good thing. 

3) Service - 5/5 - really friendly attentive staff

Would I come back here again - DEFINITELY YES. This time they better be prepared, because I will have a HUGE order. *Sigh* - one of the sins - gluttony... Errr, I take that back hehe.",4.0

"A wasted cab ride for mediocre food

The Barrio Cafe is horribly overrated.  Upon arriving at eleven for lunch, they tried to sit us in the very back, next to the bathroom, even though the place was empty.  The house margaritas were okay, but not even close to the ones from Sam's Cafe.  The chipotle chicken dip was a mess of cheese and slimy chicken, slimy spinach, and slimy mushrooms.  You sense a theme?  The smokey, sweet flavor was good for a bite or two, but it quickly became an unappetizing mess.  My husband's pork was supposed to be the special of the restaurant, but it was nothing special, and some of it was unbearably dry.  My enchiladas del mar were smothered with a horrendous quantity of cheese, and I had no idea how I was supposed to eat them, as there seemed to be mere scraps of blue tortilla amid the massive amounts of sauce and cheese.  The shrimp were decent sized, but undercooked (understandable since the tiny scallops and crab would cook a lot faster).  The churros were the highlight, but they couldn't save the meal.  Lunch ran over $100, plus cab fare.  I would rather have given the money to one of the homeless people by the Hyatt Regency.  

Another chef told me that the head chef of Barrio Cafe has left, so maybe that explains the divergent reviews.  All I know is that I would never go back to this restaurant.",1.0

"Capstone to a disappointing night! My girlfriend and I barely got in before they locked the doors 3 hours early. They were out of soup and Mac & cheese, and I'm pretty sure the guy behind the counter was just being lazy. We took our sandwiches to-go, which was a bad idea, because once we unwrapped them, we found out that one of the sandwiches (the full montagu) was missing lettuce, tomato, and cheese (probably thought we wanted the half montagu, lol). The other sandwich (chipotle chicken avocado) barely had enough ingredients to make it worthy of a sandwich. We probably would have gotten our money's worth if we just ate our $13. Shame shame Earl.

"I was in Mississauga and sick of restaurant over-salted and buttered, mass produced food. So I Yelped ""healthy"" food and found this place about a mile from my hotel. Without a car, this was the distance I was willing to walk. It was Tuesday--when it was -8 degrees with 40 mph winds.......I found the place tucked off the lobby of an office building. Upon entering, I was warmly greeted and offered two samples of house soups.  YUM!  Roasted cauliflower or the second specialty, asparagus soup. It was a hard decision to choose between perfection and perfection.  I also enjoyed the house chopped salad with tofu. The tofu was by far the BEST tofu I have ever had. While walking there whipped by the 40mph winds, I thought to myself, how could any one's food be THAT good? once I got there and tasted her food, I knew why she had lots of 5 stars....and I added my own 5 stars.

"The Heinz History Center is yet another great museum in PGH.  If you're a history buff, an out-of-towner, or new to PGH, I'd strongly suggest visiting.  I've been here three or four times, and although most of the exhibits are permanent, I always have a great time.

In terms of exhibits, my favorite is the special collections (5th floor?), which is a hodgepodge of artifacts of historical interest.  No matter who you're perusing with, there's always so much to talk about in this exhibit!  If you go through it methodically, you can easily spend an hour here alone.  The artifacts run the gamut from beds to cars to confessionals to things whose purpose you have no idea of until you read the description.

Another favorite exhibit of mine is Pittsburgh through the ages, which allows you to see how the city has changed over the years, and some of the people who've influenced it greatly.  When I came here with my parents, they were very impressed at how versatile PGH is, and how many talented people are from here!  Also, don't forget to stop by the Pittsburghese exhibit located nearby for a laugh.

I'm not much of a sports buff, so I don't get as much out of the Western PA sports exhibit as many people do, but it also provides some interesting background about the history of sports in PGH.  Even if you're not very into sports, I'd recommend taking a quick spin through this section unless you're pressed for time.

I agree that the layout of the exhibits can be somewhat unintuitive (I've unknowingly skipped exhibits)--I'd recommend starting from the top floor and working down.  This museum is located in the Strip District, which is a great section of PGH for shopping and eating, so when you're finished at the museum, I'd strongly recommend exploring the area.  4.5 stars.",4.0

Although it was only 2:30 in the afternoon, there weren't many pastries or desserts on hand to choose from... I had my mind set on trying an almond and a chocolate, but Scratch had run out of the former.  There were three chocolate croissants left (as well as a couple of raisins), so I ordered one to go.  Decided to try it before leaving to see if I wanted to get the rest... Needless to say, I left with all three!

$2.70 plus tax per choccy croissant.  Didn't have time to try the local coffee.  Perhaps next time, when I plan to come earlier to secure an almondine, or two.

I liked how the tables were set up for service- the setting emitted romance already.  Can't wait to try dinner here soon...  Spied three different entremets in the cases, as well as some delicious-looking truffles.",3.0
"Went for summerlicious lunch with 14 people for a birthday. We all found the food to be quite bland and not worth $24. In addition, there were multiple bugs in one of our bread baskets, which was dealt with by moving the table the bugs had crawled onto. When it came time to pay the bill, the entirety of everyone's individual bills was put onto one, which was fine, but they decided to collect the money from each individual person instead of allowing us to put all the money together and give it to them. This resulted in them claiming we were $18 short despite that almost everyone paid tipped at least a dollar extra over their bill with included tax and tip. As the birthday girl was ready to leave and was not in the mood to argue, we paid the $18 and left on a sour note feeling very unsatisfied.",1.0
"OMG, is all you would have to say about this place. It's amazing! I spent the last year in TX and didn't have anything remotely close to this. I have to say the Carolinas have BBQ down. The NC BBQ sauce and the SC mustard sauce was unlike anything I've ever tried..... the portions are beyond shareable or plenty leftovers any which way you do it you win! The only negative and I say that loosely was that there was an up charge for the combo plate ""whole bunch"" for choosing the spareribs and brisket which was not printed on the menu. I say full disclosure on pricing is a MUST. That aside it was pricey but worth every penny or in this case dollar.",5.0
"Really confused by the good reviews here. The food at this place is not good and being new to this area, even I would hesitate to call it authentic ""NC BBQ"".

I've been here twice now and it was disappointing both times. I had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich the first time and it was dry and bland. I had the spinach salad with blackened chicken today and the chicken was too salty and the flavors just didn't go well together.

It seems like people go to this place more for the ambiance and probably cause it's been a neighborhood favorite all these years. Who knows. 

I've had BBQ in Raleigh and so I have a sense of what BBQ is supposed to taste like. With the exception of Soul and the Cellar, the food scene in Charlotte is just sadly mediocre.",2.0

"Hotel is great value and very comfortable. Staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. Very near many great eating places like Olive Garden and outback.

The rooms have been remodeled in last few months and they are really great! NIce carpet and rooms.  We had a great stay.",4.0
"This is probably a useless review. I was here years ago and I don't remember the food that well. I hade an iceberg salad with blue cheese that was pretty good, but can't recall my entree. Anyway, what I love about this place was that we sat in a little booth with curtains that closed. It was so fun and it made me feel famous.",3.0
"Went here to celebrate my birthday and had a fantastic experience. Our guide was knowledgeable, experienced, and funny. Spent about an hour and a half in the air above Phoenix with a gorgeous view, then came down and had breakfast and mimosas. Basket wasn't cramped even though there were 13 of us. I definitely suggest giving these guys a call. Worth the money!",5.0
"Had lunch with friends on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is small but clean. We were promptly seated and served. We each ordered lunch specials ( meal comes with soup, eggroll or crab puff and the entree). I had the lemon chicken,  my friends had the mongolian chicken and the General Tso chicken. While my dish was tasty,  theirs was pretty good, but not spicy as advertised.  The fried rice was decent;  tasted slightly like it was steamed.  Overall, a nice meal for the price.",3.0
"This was my first trip to PublicUs. One vegan, one veggie, and one meat eater. This place had a little for everyone. One vegan option was the best burger. I chose the crostini with avocado, heirloom tomatoes, fresh herbs, topped with roasted garlic. It was delicious, I washed it down with a cold pressed orange juice! My wife had the waffles with fruit and whipped cream. The whipped cream was home made and the berries were so fresh and juicy. 

My brother in law had a sandwich that came with homemade potato chips. He loved the sanwhich. He also ordered the blueberry scone and said to melted in his mouth! 

My wife ordered a specialty coffee drink. She said it was very strong ! She even needed it watered down hahaha what a weakling! 

We would all definitely come back and try some new items at this place, at is was delicious. You can tell it is quite a hipster place .",5.0
A great experience each time I come in. The employees are friendly and the food is awesome.,5.0
"I don't know why I keep coming back here. I think it's because I live in the same building and I'm too lazy to go further. They are rude unless you're a regular they recognize. I've come here enough that I would be considered a regular, but they are still rude to me. It doesn't matter if you make an appointment. You can just walk in and they will tell you pick a colour and wait. I don't think they sanitize their equipment, although the place looks nice and clean. The price is typical of the area and if you pay cash, there's no tax. I stopped going here when another nail salon opened down the street.",2.0
"We stopped on a Sunday night around 4pm. For us, it was a really late lunch. We were in the mood for Pad Thai, and Siam Cafe didn't disappoint. Great flavor, perfect noodles, and well seasoned. Restaurant was fairly busy for 4pm. You know it's good when that many people are there. Service was good, too. Overall great place to stop - be forewarned, the menu is VERY extensive. So many options to choose from, it might take you a while to sort out what to get. Every time a dish walked by on a tray, I would get FOBO! They all looked great.",5.0
"Ordered lunch delivery. They falsely advertise their pricing for delivery on their website. And when this was pointed out, the driver laughed and said ""it's company policy"" and then when I called, the lady on the end of the phone also didn't seem to care and said ""well, the price changed."" I advised that their website still showed 1.49 for the delivery fee, I was charged $2 and she said ""It's only 50 cents."" .Yes, it is only 50 cents. So why not just suck it up for customer service and charge me the price advertised? It's the principle of it. On top of it, I was charged a $1 card service fee which of course wasn't mentioned when she asked ""cash or card?"" and I told her card. No resolution. No customer service. The food was actually pretty good. Too bad their customer service didn't match.",1.0
I had Mike come out and install 3 bathroom trim kits. He did an excellent job... Affordable and highly professional. I would recommend them for any of your plumbing needs!,5.0
Terrible experience. Truck was tiwed and was told by front desk that I could pick my truck up after 430. I would just have to call and they would send somebody down. Called at 600 and was told that the guys were all out on tows and it would be an hour. 90 minutes later a truck showed up. The guy wouldn't even stop for half a second to hear me out. He said he just stopped to use the bathrrom and would have to wait for the next guy. He hit the road wi th out another word. Its now closing in on 8. Still no word back from them yet....,1.0
"The biggest selling point is the ""outside"" seating area (still inside the Paris Hotel with the fake blue sky and French architecture). You truly feel you could be on the Champs Elysee. Almost. 

The food is good, not great. The bloody Mary was disappointing. The servers are busy hurried and, well act like Parisian waiters, who can be stand-offish. 

We ate there once for dinner and once for lunch. The salmon burger was good, probably a Trader Joes frozen patty or similar, on a brioche bun with cole slaw. It was tasty, but nothing special. Cobb Salad was filled with the good stuff and tasty. Ceasar salad was good, but you have to ask for the anchovies, although it's included on the menu. Our party had several plates, all which were acceptable to good. Again, the food isn't bad, but just nothing you will remember. The ambiance, however, is worthy of the experience.",3.0
"Saw that a new eyebrow threading place opened up near my house, so I went to go check it out.  

Eyebrow threading is decently priced at $8.  My first time there, the lady I got did a great job with my eyebrows and really took her time to make sure I was happy.  She even gave me a VIP card that included free upper lip threading with eyebrow threading or a free eyebrow threading with eyebrow tint.  

I used the card for my second time and I felt my experience was rushed, she didn't shape them well, missed hairs, and when I got home, I noticed she even cut me where my arch forms.  

Not sure if it was the VIP card that changed the tone of service.  I mean, why offer a free service if you aren't going to deliver the same as if I was paying for it?  I'll give them another try, but for now, I'm a little weary about the hot and cold service.",3.0
Charming place and great service. I came here for coffee and to work remotely for a while. The service was good and friendly. The almond milk latte was delicious.,5.0
"I stayed here 3 night with my husband for the x-mas.
The front staff who help check in or check out was very nice n helpful.
Room was not huge but its enough for us.
Especially i love the restroom but one bad thing was that there wasnt fan for fresh air.
There was a refrigerator in room but its not cold enough.
House keeper didnt understand english but its not a problem.
We didnt knw that There was $50 deposit when we check in.
It was good that Pool was 24hours but I couldn't use it coz the weather was too cold outside.
Everyday Bottle water was free.
Coffee pot was free as well.
Sofa in the room was just one.
It was supposed to be two at least.
Most things I was satisfied renaissance hotel.",4.0

I love mochiko chicken so I had to try this place. Food was good. Service was excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Had the curry bowl. It was good. The bento was good also. Mochiko sauce was onolicious!  They are in the process of changing the menu so I will be back.,4.0
"This was a really fun bar, good vibe and great live music- definitely get there early for it.",5.0
"I cannot disagree more with these reviews. Dr. Stearns, and PA Jennifer Kiser are without a doubt, the BEST doctors a person who struggles with chronic pain, could ever hope to see.
I started as Dr. Stearn's patient when I was just in high school - having seen about 20 specialists before her, for persistent, debilitating, worsening, and sickening nerve pain which no one could diagnose, and everyone refused to treat. I had been given the runaround by doctors more times than I can count - and it had been years of waiting for treatment, only to be told I needed to see someone else. Dr. Stearns was the FIRST doctor to treat me, and offer me any semblance of pain relief. Dr. Stearns never gave up - trying all kinds of medications, physical therapies, procedures, etc etc etc. She did 3 revision surgeries for me - trying to get better coverage with a neurostimulator. When I went away for college, and then again when I moved after getting married, I experienced other pain doctors. Only upon Dr. Stearns' recommendation did I finally find a doctor in KY who understood my condition, and was able to treat me. I have NEVER found another doctor who has the tenacity and perseverance and compassion that Dr. Stearns and Jennifer Kiser have. Ever.  One of the reasons my husband and I moved back to AZ was for my health; and the fact that I was able to re-enter Dr. Stearns' practice gave us such reassurance about that decision. Not having to find a new pain specialist - but instead getting to come back to a doctor I'd known for so long, who knew me so well...it was just the greatest! 
I have had a pain pump since 2008. Back in 2012, Dr. Stearns surmised that the catheter that was supposed to be getting the pain medication from the pump into my spinal fluid was broken - and therefore I wasn't getting the proper dose. She was the 1st doctor to get a new kind of catheter, reinforced with fiberglass, and she made sure I was one of the 1st patients to receive it. I am only 29 years old, and Dr. Stearns and Jennifer Kiser have, and continue, to do all they possibly can to encourage and support me in my goals towards an active and fulfilled life; despite my chronic pain condition. I recently started with the Yoga Practitioner for the CPSC, and can't say enough good about her as well. I feel that I am being given the utmost in care. 
Dr. Stearns is not  wishy washy, nor is she intimidated by anyone. You cannot push her around. For me , this is incredibly refreshing, and gives me great assurance. I want a doctor who will tell me the truth; who will go above and beyond and never give up, and who will let me know how I can best participate in my own wellness. Dr. Stearns is ultimately skillled, and proactive; and I am forever grateful for her.",5.0
"The first time I came here was for drinks around 11:30 on a Saturday night.  It was very crowded and Scottsdale-y, and I didn't care if ever went back.  Recently some out-of-towners wanted to check it out because of the mechanical bull, so we started out our evening by eating dinner there around 9:00 on Saturday night.  I have to say, it was better than I expected.

Some of the positives:  

- The menu is huge and varied.  
- You get to choose a side dish to go with the sandwiches.  
- A smaller portion is offered for some of the dishes.  
- Complimentary biscuits and corn muffins.  They didn't exactly taste homemade, but they weren't bad and kind of added to the Saddle Ranch theme.
- We got free shots 'from the owner' which the waitress brought over with our drinks.  Mind you, the shot started with a B and had whipped cream on top (you get the idea), but it tasted pretty good.  Free anything is always well-received.  

I ordered the barbecue chicken sandwich and chose the sweet potato casserole sans marshmallows as my side dish.  The sandwich was just okay -- the barbecue sauce was pretty bland and the ""sourdough"" bun tasted like white bread.  The sweet potato casserole was delicious.  My friend's quesadilla was pretty good.  Our other friend seemed to enjoy her turkey burger.  All in all this was not a bad pre-game locale.  And in case you're wondering, the two out-of-town guests somehow managed to stay on the mechanical bull.",4.0
"This is a great place. The teriyaki chicken is the best I've ever had. Tangy, sweet, salty, smoky... The business owner is a genuinely good man who seems to care about everyone.

UPDATE: For those who get takeout, I feel compelled to update my review to give a heads-up to those ordering. The older gentleman always manages the lines perfectly, and helps everyone in a truly remarkable fashion. There is a lady who is sometimes there during the day, however, who does a less stellar job of balancing between the normal and call-ahead lines.

Despite recognizing me, and having what turned out to be my food finished and ready when I got there, I still waited 15 minutes to get it while people who had not called in came in and out, and other people who also had already ordered but were dining in picked up their orders.

I have a limited amount of time during my lunch hour, and many options for food. There's a reason I called ahead, and it isn't to stare at my food getting cold for 15 minutes while people who chose not to have the foresight to do so get served first.

Moral of the story is, great food, just make sure you pointedly ask if that's your food sitting on the counter rather than trusting her to let you know when it's ready.",4.0
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! This is my go to spot when I want seafood. There is always a bit of a wait but if you go a little later than normal dinner time its not bad at all. The service is always prompt and the food is always amazing!,5.0
"Brought in my car for an oil change and standard check up.  Returned to find that other repairs had been made (changed a windshield wiper that had been working fine and had thrown out the old ones...stuck with the purchase?).  Unpleasant experience with person working with me.  Very rude.

The receptionist(s) were friendly, however, and the free coffees and shuttle were a great feature.  Overall, I would go to someone more trustworthy and pick up my own lattes and arrange for my own taxi.",2.0
"**if you're a sushi snob please do yourself a favor and move along by picking another restaurant from your yelp search result. ;) **

if you're less critical and like a variety of sushi and rolls then this just might be your spot. this little gem is definitely located off the beaten path and was suggested to me by one of my best friends who used to live in vegas. like most restaurants in vegas the most accessible/convenient places are pretty much buffets so i was a bit hesitant when i heard this is ayce (all you can eat). okay i'm not gonna lie...my first response was a NO to the idea of ayce, but fortunately my group and i caved when our pick was closed for some reason.

i've been here three times now and they've all been enjoyable experiences. the staff there were not only friendly (a must), but ATTENTIVE. our waitress checked on us frequently, but not to the point of annoyance. lastly, oyshi is not just a good place for sushi, but you also don't feel gouged when you're done...

helpful suggestions:

-this restaurant is off the 215 freeway so plan your transportation wisely;  cabbing it over there might be a bit expensive.

-make reservations if you can as they can be extremely busy, but if you can't then go early. my group showed up around 6'ish and was seated immediately _barely_ missing the dinner rush.

-the menu selections are pretty big so try not to make multiple orders of the same item so you can try different things. this is also important because not all their items are fresh, like uni or oysters.",4.0
"If you want the best cut in town then you've found your place. I've been coming here since February and was sold the first time I got my hair cut. The owner Anthony has cut my hair every time and all the other barbers are always friendly. The shop provides a chill vibe with different types of music playing each time you walk in. I recommend making an appointment, its saves time, but in the case were you are a walk in you can always relax with a cold brew. I've recommended numerous friends anytime they have asked me where I got my hair cut.",5.0
"I was skeptical as the menu primarily had gourmet/abstract toppings (I was not expecting this). However, I was blown away by the quality of the house dog! This was an amazing choice. 

One thing I noted is they seemed short handed. It took quite awhile so if in a hurry this may not be a good choice. This was rectified with great customer service however as they added additional fries due to the wait and gave deep fried oreos to others that waited a considerable amount of time. 

Only knock would be the fries....nothing great about them...just OK.

I will be back for the house dog!!!",4.0
"Walked into this place wanting to try it for the longest time. I was in serious need of caffeine on a Sunday afternoon. The service wasn't thr best as the barista looked disinterested in serving me but whatever I was taking my food to go. I walked in just wanting to order a latte but after paying for it I noticed the delicious looking crème brûlée croissant by the pastry display and had to get that as well. I was so curious as to how it tasted like a crème brûlée, I thought it was just a torched sugar crust but was pleasantly surprised to see a vanilla bean custard like filling inside of it and quite a bit of it as well not just a tiny blob but a good amount of custard filling. I throughly enjoyed the Crème brûlée croissant and can't wait to go back for it again, can't say the same for the latte though. It was forgettable, maybe next time I will try the coffee.",3.0
"Really flavorful and very fresh food. I asked them to alter their Mongolian Beef to my taste.... Spicy, no problem!!! It came and tasted so wonderful I couldn't believe. Only comment in a sort of negative way, too much sauce for me, but other than that totally awesome. Think about asking for lighter sauce unless you like lots of sauce.",5.0
"Just as others have said, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!  I used Travelocity to book my trip and figured I would need transportation back and forth from the airport to the Tropicana hotel.  A cab would have been cheaper.  From the airport to Tropicana, the ride was fine.  Leaving was terrible.  I called 24 hours before like they tell you to and reservations were made to pick the 4 of us up at 6:15am.  We get down to the front entrance and my 3 friends waited outside while I checked out.  They were there at 6:15 and by the time I got outside it was 6:17 (receipt of my check out).  We waiting until 6:30 to call and the company said the bus was there from 6:15 to 6:19 and called it a no show and left.  Not one bus went through the front entrance.  They said it was our fault for not being out there on time.  I kept telling the operator 3 people were there at 6:15 and I showed up at 6:17.  He didn't want to hear it.  We had to wait until 7:15 for another bus to show up.",1.0

"Okay, I love this place, it always helps that I can walk to it, it also helps the two people I have introduced to it, loved it as well.

Farmhouse Burger - for those times you want a burger and do not want to regret it an hour later. ;) I've had this delivered to my house (I know I was super lazy) and I've eaten it in the restaurant. Its just as good either way!
- whole wheat ciabatta, great meat and you can have cheddar, vegan, goat or mozzarella cheese on it. I went with goat, nom!

Oh and the Garlic Parmesan Fries (Sweet Potato) are a fantastic addition to the burger.

Previous trips I've had the Roasted Mushroom and Goat Cheese Flatbread, which had a tone of flavor, and the Edamame Hummus Plate which was perfect for sharing and snacking, delicious and fresh.

I also always go for their Cucumber and Mint water, very refreshing.",4.0
"The restaurant decor is beautiful and well done, very fresh. The menu options are really well portioned and healthy. There are plenty vegetarian and gluten free options.

I have been here numerous times and have tried very hard to like it. The main downfall is the logistical issues with food service and breakfast/lunch hours. Breakfast stops sharply at 11, despite the person in front of you taking 20 minutes to order a juice. So if you're in line, be prepared with multiple options. Sometimes the management walks the queue with updates on what they are out of. Lately it's been eggs and potatoes, despite these being ingredients in many menu items. It's very disappointing.

Customer service folks are super nice and well uninformed, but they lack the resources to succeed since kitchen to table service is slow and the electronic table markers do not work. Servers pace the whole restaurant with your food, asking random guests what their number or order was.

I want this beautiful place to work, but you need a lot of patience and time to go here.",2.0
"I've been to Lyfe at least five times. None of those visits has resulted in a satisfactory meal. It's a beautiful space, conveniently located and the service is great. They have a killer water machine from which you can get ambient water, cold water and sparkling water. I give them 2 stars for the above.

I can't give them any stars for the food. Nothing I have tasted there has been remotely good. Even the sweet potato fries. I bake better ones at home in my toaster oven. The vegetable sides are offensive, the pastas are a joke and the appetizers are very underwhelming. Basically, you don't come here for a great, tasty meal. You come here to eat under 500 calories which you can probably do in lots of other places with a more palatable outcome. 

Also, it's horribly expensive. So I would avoid. No sixth visit for me. Fool me five times...",2.0
Service is good and hotel staff are friendly. Cookies in the afternoon that are still warm. Wish they are available all day. Can't expect much from the breakfast but it's a quick and easy if you are in a rush in mornings. Right off the hwy 427 so easy to get to downtown. Will stay again.,4.0
"Been here alot over the past 7yrs. Loved it, but unfortunately after tonight..I think I bid farewell. Calamari (11.25) is frozen & over done. Chicken Piccata (15.25), which I've had there before, was terrible. The sauce had a film on it, but dish was luke warm. Chicken was dry & sauce had a faint lemon taste. Hubby got linguine w/ white clam sauce (11.25) I'm no expert on clam sauce so in his words, it was brothy & lacked the taste he wanted. Anyway, service was average. I guess crossword puzzles are more important than increasing your tip ;)",2.0

The fireplace is a nice intimate touch. Their variety in liquor choices is vast and some of the best! I decided to choose wine this time around. The house cab was surprisingly good. Most house anything is cheap and flavorless but not here. My love and I ordered the small plates to share as they were $5 each. You cannot beat that.

People will still come to Steves Hotdogs after getting wasted if they were in the heart of Ohio City or even Gordon Square. Trust me. Move.",4.0

"I always knew this store was on the strip, but I never actually had a chance to come inside until this past weekend! This store is freaking insane... I personally love peanut M&M's, but I'm not sure that I'd get crazy and start buying expensive t-shirts and mugs to rep my favorite peanut colors. 

If you didn't know though, they have a very small theater on their top level that plays about a 12 minute M&M movie in 3D that's great for kids and has an AWESOME scene towards the end where all it does is blow cold air at you... perfect for when it's hot outside!

We didn't buy anything this time because we were just passing through, but we'll definitely come back next time to get some snacks :)",5.0
"If you ever dreamt of being surrounded by rivers of chocolate, this is definitely one of the closest places that you can get to doing that! You can take a picture with the green M & M, fill up on various different flavors, and even pick up keychains if you're a collector! 

Visiting this place as a child, it was definitely one of the most vivid memories I've had in regards to Vegas besides picking up an advertisement for strippers at the age of nine. So if you have kids, or are just feeling nostalgic in regards to candy, this is a MUST on your list of tourist attractions while in the area.",4.0

"Just went in for a massage- very disappointed. First of all, this is the second time I attempted to get a massage at ritual. I originally purchased two groupons for a girlfriend and I to have a spa day together. After we moved our schedules around to be able to go in at the same time after lunch together, ritual called the day before to tell us they could accommodate only one of us the next day, as someone was sick. I realize that happens, but it ruined the point of us going in together.  I insisted that my girlfriend keep her appt. after our lunch, and said I would come back another time. 
Fast forward a few months- I scheduled at appt. for 2pm today (was told with a female massage therapist). Ritual called me this morning to say that due to marathon traffic, they were running 30 min behind, and could I come at 2:30. I said okay. 
I made sure to arrive promptly to ensure I didn't waste any of my 50 minute massage on changing etc...  I got there at 2:25, received an okay massage from a MALE therapist (requested more pressure, but it remained lighter that I would have liked), and was dressed again by 3:11pm.  That is 41 minutes into my appointment- absurdly short. When I mentioned this to reception, she said the 50 minute massage includes change time- well then call it a THIRTY minute massage. And don't charge $90 for it (by the time I returned, my groupon had expired, so I paid face value of $90 for the ""50"" minute massage). Will never return.",2.0

"Been here a few times now so it's time for the review.  Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said ""no"" because I didn't think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha.

So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite.

Yup, the portions are small, but they're darn good vittles I tell ya.  Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points.",4.0

I stopped at Pita Jungle after I left my heart doctors office and he said you have to eat better your cholesterol is high. So I drove over to Pita Jungle because fuck it one last philly steak and cheese isn't going to kill me. The food there is excellent and the people god-damn rock whom work there. They are always nice and tell me what is good and what has changed or been added to the menu. The pita jungle garlic dip is the thing of dreams and my body loves it.,5.0
"I've now eaten at a few Sauce locations and every experiance has been very positive. I really enjoyed the airport location because I travel a lot and have found often times you don't find good food at airports. The food came out quick which is great when you have a flight to catch. They boxed it up for me nicely which made it easy for my to take leftovers onto the plane if I wanted.

 I've tried a few of the pastas and they are all great, my fav is the Chicken & broccoli pasta, delicious. Sauce has also help me find a new favorite wine, Snoqualmie, which is difficult because I am so picky when it comes to my wine. Has to be sweet and fruity. Cheers to you Sauce !!",4.0

"I lift the weights and I put them down! This review is only for the actual free weights / gym area as I did not use any of the spa services.

One of the better casino health clubs I have trained at. The Spa at Bally's gym is loaded with free weights, machines, benches, cardio, and dumbbells. It has one of the best selections of Icarian machines I have seen in a casino gym, along with real steel free weight plates, cable racks, bars, smith machine, and a great selection of metal dumbbells up to 100 pounds. I hate those rubberized weights. There is a nice cardio area off to the side with Cybex treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. A few flat screens hang from the ceiling.

The facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself.

The hours of the gym are 6am - 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for $51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down. As with all casino health clubs it's not cheap, but worth it for the quality of the equipment here, and if you value staying on top of your fitness while away from home.

It's not like going to your normal fully stocked gym where you have your membership at, but it's more of a compact version, and better than many of the casino or hotel gyms I have used.",4.0
"Put blinders on the kids! Strip club on the left, adult film studio on the right...I need to visit this area without the family next time.  But once you get in and look beyond the smoky interior, its quite comfortable.

Orange Chicken - yes, probably not the dish you'd want to order at a Thai place, but it was good!  Neon orange crunchy candy coated fried chunks of chicken.  If that is your type of thing with a bowl of white rice, then you'd be in heaven.  

Pad See Ew - also pretty good here.  Of course we had to get everything with spice level 0 for the kid but the ingredients all had good texture and felt fresh.

Neighboring businesses probably scare some of their potential customers away but they're just missing out on some good food.",3.0
"You should go anywhere else to get a bagel - don't waste your time stopping at this location. I've been here 3 times in the last 2 months after moving to the neighborhood, and this location of Einstein Bagels keeps getting worse. Odds are they won't have the bagels you want when you walk in, or if they do they'll ""run out"" before your order is completed.

Einstein, how do you run out of bagels? YOU HAVE ONE JOB! If you're out of a specific type of bagel by mid-morning today (and last weekend, and the one before, etc.), why not go ahead and close for the day when you start running out instead of disappointing all of us? We'll know you are out because the door is locked and won't waste our time waiting in line for you to fail again. Also, I'm pretty sure your bagels aren't handcrafted by some old-world artisan in the back of the store - you're effectively a fast-food restaurant even if this location doesn't have a drive-thru, so why do you not order/make more bagels for next time if you run out on a consistent basis? People go out for breakfast on the weekends and might sleep late before they go out, so why are you out of anything before noon on a Saturday or Sunday?

A few weeks ago I stopped in for a sick friend who had requested either an asiago cheese bagel or an everything bagel...the customer in front of me ordered the last asiago cheese bagel in the bin, and they were out of everything bagels. I walked out and bought our breakfast elsewhere. It was a Saturday morning at 10:15 am, so I'm sure we weren't the last people not to get what we came to Einstein for that day.

The visit today looked more promising because I saw 2 asiago cheese bagels in the bin when I got in line. They were out of pretzel bagels and down to 1 apple cinnamon bagel, 1 potato bagel, and 2 Spinach Florentine bagels, so other people would soon be disappointed and have to get something else...but not me, not today! Both asiago cheese bagels were still there 5 minutes later when I made it through the long line and ordered, and the woman taking orders seemed to remember me from my last failed visit and thanked me for coming back. I went to the other end, paid, and waited for about 5 more minutes before someone behind the counter flagged me down to tell me they were now out of asiago cheese bagels and what would my second choice be? I asked for the manager's name and number, and the girl at the checkout counter cheerfully pointed and said ""she's right there."" I asked for the owner's name and number instead, thinking that the manager either must be in on the supply problem or just too incompetent to notice it, and the counter girl kinda shrugged and gave me a blank look. The counter girl refunded my money and hollered to the woman taking orders at the other end to ""start watching her bagels,"" so I was only out the 10 minutes wasted and the same disappointment from my last visit. It was 9:45 am - so much for coming in earlier. It was strange though...no one from Einstein seemed to think that it was unusual to ask a customer for their second choice, so maybe everyone else who comes here just has lowered expectations and goes along with it?  :(

I had previously considered going to the next closest Einstein location for asiago cheese bagels, even though it would be several miles away. After today, I realized that we all deserve a more sustainable bagel solution with better customer service. When I find it, I'll let you know...in the meantime, you're better off going to Safeway next door for your bagels.",1.0
"I suppose one of the things that I loved was the sheer variety and difference of the many dishes available.  Variety is good.  But I find that usually in sushi restaurants, that when such a place has so many dishes on their menu, they tend to all come out with a vaguely similar taste underneath.  Not so here.  Each dish has its own flavor and flair.  

But what stood out to me the most was the service.  I've been here thrice for dinner, and have had three different waiters/waitresses serve.  They were all very attentive, very personable, and had this way of making you feel special.  Whatever training they give their employees must be amazing. Frankly, I've never received nearly as much satisfaction I got from the service here.  I'm extremely surprised, actually:  I'm very much an introvert and do not usually welcome so much attention.

My only complaint (though not much of one) was the lack of choices in the dessert menu.  Everything had some form of ice-cream as the central fare.  They tasted fine, but I would have liked a wider selection.",5.0
"Thoroughly enjoyable but I can understand the hot and cold reviews for this place.  MY experience was great because it was on a slower saturday afternoon.  But had I come at a packed time I can see how the service can turn into a hurried rush and the food could lack quality.

I ordered the bennies just because I heard it was so good.  and true enough, they were quite well done.  I'm a HUGE fan of their hollendaise which I usually HATE.  It has this wonderfully light lemon taste.  SO yummy.

The service was fine, all the female servers were quite nice and friendly and took their time to make sure we felt welcome.  But again, had I come at a busier time I can see how they might be perceived as not-so-nice.  

the decor.  Can we talk about the decor?  It is AWESOME.  It is a narrow little room with nice dark wood tables and then some weird ass shiny/sparkly vinyl seating for the booths.
The small and intimate space was VERY nice.

This place is a tad pricey, but it is quality food for a portion that is sensible (meaning they don't give you too much food that you feel obliged not to waste and they don't give you a tiny portion where you feel cheated).

I'd go again, but I wouldn't be a regular.",4.0

"Been here a couple times.  Both of which were for celebratory occasions and we all had a good ol' time.  The food is delicious and fun to look at but forbiddingly expensive.  I mean, on the level of a Michelin restaurant but without the value for the experience you get.  However, I would say for special days or a VIP visit, this is a great restaurant.  It is memorable and you will definitely remember your visit here, so that itself is worth three stars.  Get the monster dessert tower.",3.0

I wish they didn't hire these young guys who look if they are skipping high school: I don't expect anything special from a server but I don't want to wait for ten minutes for my check, I expect to get my drink refilled after I was asked if I want it refilled and finally, when I'm trying to remind him about the refill I don't appreciate being told ""Have a nice day"".",2.0

"I've been coming here for years since my family moved to Vegas. I have always had amazing servers and service period. The place is always clean, and the price is always great (especially for locals), but over the years, the buffet has gotten less and less exciting. It's a great place to sit, talk, and eat, but the quality of the food has gone down a bit. There are so many things to eat though that for the price, it is a steal! I love that they have the Asian soup section (I get the pho) and the seafood section with crab legs and shrimp. I like that they now give you a choice between hot and cold crab legs. What I do not like and will never understand is why they merged the Seafood Buffet with it. It's a little sad that it is no longer the same, but I guess it works.

I will still always recommend for people to give it a try!",3.0

My husband bought an engagement ring that would require a jacket band, but I also wanted to be able to wear the band alone because of where I work.

"First time stopping in here and it was a delight!  I was immediately greeted by the super friendly staff.  From placing my order to paying for my meal, they were all professional, courteous and smiling!  Great customer service!

Now ~ they have many many items to choose from.   Ultimately decided on the Turkey Cranberry Gourmet Sandwich and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.   This is part of the pick 2 for $7.99.   Nice!  I was used to the Panera pick 2 when it only comes with 1/2 sandwich but here it is the whole sandwich!  Fantastic! 

The Turkey Cranberry is served on a ciabatta bread roll with sprouts, cucumber, cheese, mixed greens and house made honey mustard.  This was a fabulous combination of ingredients that my taste buds sure did enjoy! The great thing about their ciabatta bread is it was soft and not flaky.  Sometimes that type of bread can be really tough to chew but they have theirs figured out.  

Now for the soup.  Some people might cringe at the fact of eating cauliflower. The Wisconsin Cauliflower soup was really great! It has a flavor and texture of potato cheese soup! I see more and more recipes using cauliflower instead of potatoes.  Cuts calories and healthier (I think or that's what I'm telling myself).  My opinion is the soup was great and give it a try!

BONUS BONUS BONUS~~~ Their sandwiches come with a chocolate covered strawberry! The strawberry was fresh and the chocolate had a great non-bitter flavor!

I had a lobster pasta and my friend had a variation of spaghetti. No way that was cooked fresh to order. We both took a bite and immediately realized that the food tasted like it came out of a can. The pasta was inedible. The lobster was overcooked and gross. Neither of us could eat our meals so we notified the manager. He asked if we wanted to switch to something else and we declined. Who would want to? We got up to leave and he stopped us and forced us to pay for a bottle of water and glass of wine that we didn't get to drink because we had no meal for it to go with. Seriously? You serve us inedible food and then force us to pay for the beverages we didn't drink? Unforgivable.",1.0

"RUN LIKE HELL!!! New to the area and I have heard so many people talk about Captains Steve's and how great it is so this past weekend I decided to try it out. I was really excited! We went on Saturday around 2pm for lunch. Wasn't a lot of people there so I thought perfect. This would be the perfect time to spend some time with my family, relax, and enjoy lunch. Walked in and never received a greeting welcoming us to the place. We had received dinner menus so as soon as I sat down I asked for the lunch menu was informed that they do not use the lunch menus on the weekend. Ok no big deal. Our waitress Kristen was the absolute worst!!! She had a horrible attitude! Never smiled and came across like we were bothering her whenever we asked for something or when we asked her to come back because we were still reviewing the menu. She failed to refill our water glasses and when we finally brought it to her attention she poured water all over our table and did not even offer to clean it up. Horrible customer service experience!! The food was just ok. Wasn't seasoned very well. Overall I was not impressed and will not be back!!!!! 

**After talking with a few people about my experience. I learned that Captain Steve used to own this location on Monroe but it was bought out a few years back and they kept the name. not the same owners as the one in Harrisburg or Fort Mill.

"THIS is the best of the best parks in Las Vegas/Henderson/Summerlin. 

My husband and I needed something to do the day after Christmas. We were still groggy from eating turkey and drinking the day before though. We really did not feel like driving all the way to Red Rock. I happened to locate this park right here on Yelp, and noted from the reviews there is a small ""mountain"" (hill) to hike up.

When we arrived the park was full of children and adults alike. The children were playing on the Western themed playground equipment, and some were running around on the large expanse of green grass. The park is very well kept. It looks as though it could be plopped down into a city like Colorado Springs and not be out of place. 

""Shoelace Mountain"" is an easy hike, not too far up, not too steep, even for beginners this would be kind of easy. I am a wussy when it comes to going DOWN anything though, so of course, I had to inch my way down after we made it up. Once you get to the top there is a look-out place with information regarding the Las Vegas Valley and surrounding areas. You can see the strip, all of the valley and look across to Red Rock as well. There are also picnic benches up at the top.

Overall this park is a perfect retreat for city-dwellers who don't want to go far to ""get away"".",5.0

I never gave her a time limit either, she just decided she was done and left. She was late, she did the worst job ever and to to top it off she overcharged my husband (I had to leave and I assumed she would charge what we had discussed) and then had the audacity to say she gave us a discount when I questioned her about it.

"Very overrated place. OMG I am actually quite shocked how less than uneventful my experience was. 

I visited Cleveland on business and decided to check this joint as it advertised itself as ""earth friendly"" organic, natural food with lots of beer  and wine choices. I am all over it.

I set at the bar and it took a while for someone to recognize my existence. I asked for menu, they took menu from a customer sitting next to me and gave it to me. I asked for a draft beer since I am SD bound beer cruiser ;) they had nothing I liked, tried 3 wines and settled on one ""not very exciting"" chardonnay. It was uneventful and I didn't feel like I was getting a good vibe from the bar crew. The menu didnt sound as interesting either....Since I couldn't order anything I liked to drink I decided to get something small to eat...WHAT A MISTAKE!!! I should have left without ordering anything. 

I got this ridiculously small cabbage salad (size of a tea china cup plate) for $8....OMG....seriously?

"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.

Overall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.

Sampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.

Even though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats.",4.0
"Service was so slow that I got up and got a pitcher and filled up all four of our glasses.  Then, we got the bill and the wine wasn't discounted.  When we inquired he said it was bottles only.  When we asked where it says that (see pic) he said it doesn't. He gave us the wrong change for the bill we paid cash for. The neighbors bill also had to be sent back.  The food was ok but the service was unacceptable. I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend.",1.0
"I've visited this place several times for basic colds and flus, and also visited them for 2 injuries. For the 5 or 6 times I have visited I've received spectacular service. If you've ever been to an ER or basic doc visit, you understand that waiting is not fun, and, the overall lack of communication and service. Arcadia Urgent Care processed me saw me quickly every time, and when there was a wait I knew where I stood from the excellent communication from the front office staff. The physician's and assistants are all friendly and very thorough! They all seem to be very qualified clinicians who cared about helping me! A couple of times I was shocked at how much time they took to explain to me what was going on with my xray, and also an issue I had with a neck pain. I felt at ease asking no stupid question and felt like they genuinely cared about answering me until I really understood. I found myself attending this place quite a bit more when I had to change to a ridiculously high deductible health plan, so it was actually cheaper for me to visit Arcadia Urgent Care than wasting my time with a primary care doc who would charge me their ""discounted"" rate. The flat fee made sense and I like knowing what I'm paying for. The location is outstanding and the hours are convenient.....easy to go in after work or on the weekend. I am sure I will be sick or injured again (sadly), and will definitely be back! Thank you for such excellent service and care.",5.0
"I hesitate to do this review because it can get busy in here, and let's face it, who wants to wait when you feel like crapola?
This urgent care I have made my ""primary care"" because it is staffed with ER doctors and you don't get the typical ""physicians assistant"" treatment. 
In fact, when I first went on Labor Day of 2010, the doctor there sent me to the ER and correctly diagnosed me after a month of misdiagnosis by my now former Top Doctor! 
Yesterday I went because I have a cold (no big deal) and an ear infection (big deal, I am a flight attendant and have to fly and that is a No-NO with an ear infection). There was a long wait (about an hour and a half) but once I got in to see the doctor, it was 15 minutes and I was out of there!
Very clean, organized, and professional, and EVERYONE is very, very nice.
Highly recommend this place, folks! Call in advance if you're concerned about the wait...and for God's sake, please cover your mouth when you cough and cover your nose when you sneeze!",5.0
"I am a Vegas local and Im pretty familiar with the club scene here, so of course my friends from back home put me in charge of the bachelorette party they were have here in Vegas. As a local, I know that even if you have a hook up in the club scene, it can still be a challenge to organize a whole night of parting with a large group of girls. I did some bachelorette party searching and came across Sin City Parties. I was very impressed by the packages to choose from as well as the prices. I picked a packaged and booked right away in one shot. Brandon called me & confirmed the plans for the night and asked questions that I would have not thought of, so we got the night planned out and tailored for our group.  As the night began, we got confirmation calls from Brandon as well as our host for the night. Our host was great & a lot of fun!  She made sure everything was in place & on time.

"Order of the brisket sandwich with a couple sides cost me $14 which is kind of pricey 

The pros 

Nice flavor on the brisket at the sauce good quality nicely done, not the best brisket I've ever had but above avg

The mac & cheese was all right slightly above average

The baked beans were actually the highlight of the meal might be some of the tastiest beans I can remember I've had

The cons the size of the sides really a miniature cups for two dollars each I would rather spend 2.50 to 3 dollars a side and get just a little bit more than they give, especially considering how good those beans are

They do offer what they call a plate version but I did my find another way to combine meats like most other of the barbecue places do, seems to me that they could do some work on the menu such as offering a two or a three meat combo maybe I missed it but the menu still seems to be needing a little bit more development

The staff is friendly which is a plus

This is very close to being 4stars....sure I'll give it another go and if it's good it will get bumped up there's just so many bbq places and the sides value and the ability to get more than just one meats are things that can be improved",3.0
"I was actually pretty surprised with this place. Consider it's on the strip, at the Bellagio, and you're looking for something quick to eat and that won't cost an arm and a leg.  At snacks, it's not just candy bars and potato chip bags.  You have creative burger and pizza items alongside some pretty awesome french fry variations.

First, to save time, the menu selection is a touchable screen before you approach the cashier.  It gives you your options of what you would like to have included or removed from your item.  For example, a lot of the burgers come with it's specific ingredients to make for a pretty good burger.  For the socal burger, don't forget to include the kale which is part of the burger.  The combination of the chile and the kale with a unique bun make it a treat, a good treat.  The pizza is not your all time greatest pizza but it's much much better pizza than what you find at those mall pizza spots.  Ugh, I can't stand those!

Pricing? Much more affordable than stopping at any of the restaurants off the strip, especially among any of the other food spots at the Bellagio.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you're at the Bellagio and you can't wait to go anywhere else or walk another half mile anywhere for food, and you want to save some money and make it quick so you can catch up with your spouse, friend, group, whatever, definitely stop by Snacks.  You can find it when facing the Bellagio, it's on the north side near Flamingo road and the valet by the casino and the fancy jewelry windows.  Keep an eye out, you'll find it.",4.0

We got here at around 9 PM, and ordered 5 dishes:

- Wonton soup: which we split into 5 small bowls. Decent
- Peking duck: was ok. not excellent. A little dry and small compared to other places
- green with mushroom: The green was quite bitter. Plus, in the menu it was showing baby bok choy. What we actually got was the mustard green, which was misleading.
- Mapo Tofu: was pretty salty
- orange chicken: was better than Panda Express, which saved the salty mapo tofu.

"If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be 'meh'. This place is surrounded by big commercial buildings, and I would think this  would be a good place for lunch for the employees. Also there's not many other pho places around here so I see why this place would get a lot of business. Came here craving for pho, I left kinda half satisfied. The broth was a bit too light for me, the portions were quite average, they didn't have culantro with their complimentary veggies nor my fav pickled hot peppers.

Second, I could not get the attention of the bartender, and not for lack of trying. I made it very obvious that I was trying to have someone serve me and got literally nothing in return. During the less than 10 minutes I was there, the bartender took three shots with the people at the bar.

"I've had Sparklegina give me manicure and pedicures since 2008!

After moving to AZ in 2000, I've gone to one nail salon after another and another and another...!  Finally in 2008 I met up with an acquaintance in my community and saw how beautiful her hands looked - her manicured nails were impeccable!  (THAT'S WHAT I WANT! I said to myself).  Well, let me tell you....she is so good that it's hard to get a walk in appt.  But it's worth the wait!!!!  And since then I've had a standing appt with Sparklegina ever since :o)  I receive so, so, so many compliments on my nails...REALLY it's true.  

Sparklegina has been in the nail business for years, starting from sales to education in nail care; every year she and her colleagues travel to the annual nail show in Vegas to get the newest in nail care and trends for the coming seasons.

I'm away from AZ every yr for the entire month of July; and when I go away I've learned over the years that it's not worth another nail tech retouch my nails.  I wait 5 weeks (!) to have my nails done again; she's simply the best in my opinion.  No one else does it right.  She knows her stuff!!!

Did I say that she's a great therapist too!  LOL.....  yeah, I vent when I need to and she listens and sometimes her advice is worth taking.  But she's also my confidant, she doesn't gossip.

She's a great wife to her ""mi amor"" :o)  & mom to 3 wonderful adult boys!

"Came here on a Friday night for happy hour and pre-theater dinner around 5:30pm. At that hour, it was quite empty. It started to fill up closer to 6 and 6:30pm. The experience was pleasant and the food was just OK, but nothing memorable or something to come back to.  Their website's menu does not reflect their current selections, which was disappointing as I was looking forward to having their Asian-Latin inspired/fusion sushi. They decided to only keep 2 of the 4 most popular rolls - both nigiri style.  

For starters, I had a Sunset Margarita, which was really tasty. They are still promoting the free sangria if you check in on Yelp, but I was having technical difficulties and decided to give up on playing with my cell phone in front of my guest, and ordered the $5 happy hour margarita - glad I did. This drink was probably the best thing that I ordered. We also had the kiwi-pineapple salmon ceviche for starters, which I recommend as well. The ceviche was very flavorful... I liked the tartness of the pineapple and kiwi w/ the sweetness of the salmon ceviche. There was a nice balance of cilantro that wasn't too overpowering either. They served about 2-3oz of it, with a handful of corn tortilla chips. It was an appetizer for one person, but it can be sharable between two friendly and non-ravenous dinner companions :-) 

We later grazed on the salmon/tuna nigiri ($12 for 8 pieces), chicken quesadilla ($5), chicken soft taco ($5), and chorizo soft taco ($5). In the end, we split the bill and with tax and tip, we ended up paying $26 for the entire meal, which looking back, is a good deal for the amount of food we got. I would recommend everything that we ordered; it's all a nice balance between spicy, sweet, tangy, and savory. Little bites, big drinks, and a bright, colorful environment. The atmosphere is very loud, so it is difficult to hear your conversation if you don't sit close to each other. The interior decorations were kind of cheezy, and the music playing reminded me of some generic Latin-American pop party/Jennifer Lopez Pandora station. The TVs were all showing the Golf Channel. Weird. 

Don't think I will be visiting again unfortunately, just because I'm not a tapas/small plate kind of girl :-) And, as I walked down Penn Ave, I saw other restaurants that I wish I had gone to instead. However, the place was pretty packed by the time we left (around 7pm) so it does seem like a dahntown staple for Pittsburghers.",3.0
"Had a great time at the opening of Rick Bronson's House of Comedy on 9/11. First, the place is gorgeous, it fits in perfectly with the upscale atmosphere you'll find on High Street in City North, making it the perfect addition to a date night or GNO. The bar area is beautifully lit and the bartender was extremely friendly and jovial - just what you'd expect from a bar in a comedy club. The interior is also gorgeous, it's dark and has nice lighting, including several large flatscreens behind the stage. The show was hilarious, Rick Bronson who was there for the opening did a great job of warming up the crowd, and we were literally crying we were laughing so hard when Tony Gaud and Harland Williams took the stage. My only criticism would be the table service - we ordered the hummus flatbread which was just sort of uninspired. It was a flatbread with some hummus, a few sprinkles of goat cheese and slices of radishes. The prices were about what you'd expect for this type of entertainment in this neighborhood, but we were a little surprised at the $17 drinks (double jack and cokes). Other than that we had an amazing time It and we definitely feel forgiving of any hiccups since it was opening night. I highly recommend trying it out, we will be back!",5.0

"I love love love this place :) The decor is just amazing: modern, bright and instagram worthy. Lighting is just right for your obligatory pre-meal photos! The staff are quite literally the friendliest I've ever met; they were so helpful and energetic. 

Now onto the food, I noticed the price is a little steep for a student's budget, however I appreciate that the portion and quality of the food is worth the price tag. I personally could not finish my meal in one sitting; I had quite a bit of left over rice and noodles on the two occasions I've been there. The food is not what I'm used to - it's very healthy (lol my bad) compared to your typical Thai restaurant: no deep fried stuff, no heavy sauce. I definitely think the tangerine sauce could use some more flavour though (I did ask for extra sauce but it wasn't enough). The noodles are chilled and not my thing, but it's more of a personal preference. 

I enjoyed the hand crafted drink menu and have tried three out of four drinks. The pineapple rose soda is my favourite! Wish you guys had more sizes! The bottled drinks are amazing and it was definitely refreshing to have options other than the regular fast food Pepsi/Coke variety. I tried the White tea Blueberry bottle and loved it. 

I was a bit disappointed at the limited side selections - soup, summer rolls and salad. I was looking forward to try the Viet chicken salad I saw on your instagram but I guess you guys discontinued it! Anyway, there was no summer roll both times I visited, and hardly anything else to choose as a side (4 and 5pm). :( Hope there will be more options the next time I'm around in the area!

"I've been to all of the Dos Gringos locations in AZ, and all of them have the same problem: AWFUL service and garbage food. Otherwise, it's your typical obnoxious 20 somethings kinda bar that serves its purpose, to get drunks to hang out and order cheap bar food. God knows why or how this chain has lasted so long, it's really nothing that special and there are way better cantinas and mexican style dives to go to.

You can't expect too much from a little cantina that caters to 25 year old drunks, but you should expect a tiny bit of quality in service or at least edible food. The food is typical generic bar food that happens to have a few tomatoes and cheese passed off as mexican. The tacos are small and falling apart and are the same thing you'd find at a del taco, for 3 bucks more. The chicken wings are disgusting...DISGUSTING. Take a good wing, throw it on the street, let it get run over and dusty in the hot sun, then re-fry it and let it turn rock hard, and that's what dos gringos has for wings,  I kid you not. The absolute grossest and inedible bar food ever. If you come to this place you better only order hard alcohol, because the beer is gross and flat, I don't know how a bar can manage to screw up beer, but they sure did here. I never felt more cheated out of cash then when I spent it here on this stuff, I never ask for a refund, but if I did this would be the first time.

I used to get dragged here a lot years ago by drunk buddies, and honestly nothing has improved or changed since. When you arrive it will take at least 30 minutes to get a proper order going, the service is slow and ignorant of people. If you show up on a busy weekend night, you will wait forever, but the sad thing is if you show up on a slow night on a weeknight, you will still wait forever. The servers are all over the place, they don't seem to have sections or areas they just wander all over and pick people to wait on in no organized fashion. The last time I went here with people I had a server or bar-back whatever he was take a drink order and an ice water, after waiting 15 minutes, (and the bar was only like 50 feet away) he brings me my beer and a flat water in a tiny plastic cup and gives the party of young girls next to us tall plastic glasses with tons of ice and smiles. I guess he figured I wasn't a single 21 year old girl so I didn't matter. After that he vanished and 10 minutes later I got a girl server who was okay and made things fast enough. No complaints with her, she did her job, I just wish she showed up first and not the dude who already left a bad impression. He was some arrogant british dude with the puffed out chest attitude, he flirted with all the tables full of girls but could not give a c-r-a-p about anyone else, especially us guys.  I hate arrogant servers, bars or not, get your head out of your butt and grow up, cause guess what pal? good service=tips, bad service=no tips. Any good server knows that if you want to do well, you show a good attitude and be nice, don't treat people like they are lowly little peasants there to stare at the miracle that is you. FAIL. If that's your kind of attitude go work for abercrombie and fitch in a mall in scottsdale seriously.

What can you say? It's a dive bar for the young drunk people of chandler and scottsdale to hang out in, that's really all there is to it. It's a place your drunk buddies drag you to. If getting wasted on tequila or corona is your thing, then this place works, otherwise it's a hot, crumby little dive with nothing else around it and you'd be smart to go elsewhere like mill ave or downtown phoenix.

I'm a fair reviewer too, I don't give low grades for nothing...the service was slow, I sat around texting and waiting too long, I waited a total of 25 minutes to get 1 beer and an ice water, it took 2 servers to make that happen for my group, the food was absolutely stale, and that's it. I'm really surprised to see the 4 and 5 star reviews, these people must have written them while drunk, its the only way DG can get a 5 star.

I will never be dragged here or come here again, the last time was the last straw of many past straws. Yuck dude.",1.0

for dinner we had the voodoo chicken everyone is raving about below. It wasnt bad but it wasnt amazing, it tasted like regular chicken penne  . Will try something else the next time ..which does mean that I will go next time. Our waitress was also very friendly and attentive. 
Dinner, appetisers and drinks for 4 of us came to arund $20 (without tip) so not bad for the upscale Scottsdale location where this is located. 
The complex where this is located also looks very inviting and may try a couple of other places there as well.",4.0
"I'm not sure if they changed their menu and the way they prepare their food, as the last time I went in Sept 2012, their hot dogs were on those rollers, reminiscent of a 7/11 convenience store.

Back in the day my previous trips, they had a quality hot dog that was butterfly cut down the middle and then grilled to a crispy perfection in a nice fresh bun.  I always skipped the pickle or had it put way off on the side so the pickle juice didn't get on the bun.  I'm not sure if that still exists or was replaced...  If it was replaced, they should put the hot dog on rollers in the back kitchen, 'cuz it's kinda a turn off...",3.0

"I was trying to move my Mother from California to Scottsdale without difficulty and still be close to my home in Scottsdale.  After touring this facility it was easy to see that we needed to do more research.  Staff administrators showed attitude instead of interest, indifference instead of encouragement with unproven postulates.  The rooms (for Scottsdale) were tacky, cheaply designed and furnished.  We moved on to Chandler - Horizon Bay - which, though further for us to visit, a much more luxurious and comfortable, pet friendly haven for Mom.  Would recommend further investigation before ""settling"" for less because it is close!!!",1.0

"Great place to hang out on a random day of the week when there are no bands in town because it isn't a Friday or Saturday.  This restaurant has a lounge area which had a band on a Tuesday night and was fabulous to dance to.  I have gone twice and had a great experience both times but not necessarily because of the food.  I love the sustainably farmed salmon although I say it could have been improved with some amazing sauces and sides.  The problem with dishes that are not composed as is the case with the dishes here is when you pick your sides they don't necessarily pair well with the main entree.  My suggestion would be to carry a couple of dishes which are composed dishes and let them sing together in food harmony.  The second time I went I ordered the NY with horseradish cream sauce and devoured the entire steak.  Super YUM!!  Their wine list is vast which is good but at the same time, it leaves their servers with this huge amount of knowledge they will never be able to know.  They carry an amazing Arizona wine called ""Sand Reckoner"" but our server didn't know anything about it.  This is unfortunate because they could be selling local wines and especially when they are this good!!  When you get bored with the band upstairs, go down to the cigar lounge and enjoy a good solo singer who makes you want to get up and dance on the random day!  Enjoy a good cigar and a nice cordial.  Day finished sweetly.",4.0
"Only the atmosphere kept me from giving this a one star.  We got there and weren't seated until 8:15 for our 8:00 res.  At first 3 different people came to our table and took our wine water and food orders.  Then when I got my soup they didn't bring me a spoon.  So I sat there for almost 20 minutes staring at my bisque before the waiter came to ask me how it was.  It was cold by the time I finally got a spoon.  Then, it was 30 min later we were ready to walk out because they had not dropped of our entre yet and nobody had checked in with us.  Finally the steaks came and they were barely average.  Not worth the money.  This place is on the 15th floor and the view from our private booth was great but everything else was pretty bad.  Not recommended.  Such a shame because the setting is very nice.",2.0
"Stopped by Zocalo and was able to snag a seat outside- perfect for people watching on East 4th! They have an awesome selection of margaritas here. We ordered the Grande Sangriarita (32 oz margarita topped with sangria) and although it tasted delicious it was not very strong. For the entree I ordered a combo platter with a burrito and enchilada that comes with rice and beans. The food was pretty good but nothing outstanding. Good portions for a decent price though.
Ambiance was great- fancy enough for a date but casual enough if you are just going out with friends. 
Overall a good place to try out especially if it's nice out and you can get a seat outside, but I will likely go down the street to Barrio if I'm craving real good mexican food.",3.0

"So, imagine this: Chef Lynn Crawford has invited you over for dinner. And she has crafted a menu just for the evening. Paying homage to fresh, local ingredients, a four-course culinary feast is being whipped up in the back kitchen. For you. Served family-styles, in heavy, red casserole dishes, think home cooking at its best. Yes, help yourself. And be generous...there's enough for everybody ;)

Overwhelming consensus. Exceptionally good food. Matched by equally impressive service. Rarely will I comment, unless it was abominable or outstanding...and it was wonderful. Ever walk in a restaurant to encounter that refined-perky-nose-in-air judgement? The worst. Not the case with Ruby.

Our hostess was charming, and our server was lovely and attentive...didn't miss a detail...and if a crumb was left behind, discreetly taken care of by co-owner Joey Skeir seconds later. Atmosphere? Engaging, charged and lively. We had a bloody great time. Best experience in a while.

Our menu for the eve:

ONTARIO ASPARAGUS & HARICOT VERT PANZELLA SALAD
Heirloom Tomatoes, Halloumi Cheese Croutons, Creemore Radishes, Rose Bella Cerignola Olive Vinaigrette

{we were fighting over those croutons)

GREY WEST PREMIUM TRI-TIP STEAK WITH GREEN GARLIC BUTTER
Button Mushroom & Boston Lettuce with Blue Cheese Dressing, Smashed Thompson Farm's Yukon Gold Potatoes, Darling Honey Glazed Carrots

{um. steak. medium-rare. good. that's all.
reduced to one word sentences good.
blue cheese. not a fan...still not a fan. and salad was salt-y. pourquoi? je ne sais pas.
best smashed potatoes you'll ever taste. true story.}

GLENGARRY FINE CHEESE'S BIG BROTHER
Spiced Mixed Nuts & Homemade Orange Marmalade

{who loves cheese? we do! forget the nuts & marma. vino was perfect with it}

RUBY'S CHOCOLATE CHIP SLIDERS
Ed's Real Scoop Stracciatella Gelato

{ok. our only disappointment. not rave-worthy.  expected a warm, gooey mess. minutes out of oven mess. we got hard la-gourmand-style-cookie-muffins that just confused us. we couldn't break into it. do we pick it up? eat it with our hands? throw it back in the oven? what to do?!}

FYI: The menu changes every night, every week. If you're an obsessive planner - or simply curious - you'll be able to see the week's menu on their site. Other option: opt in & get daily menu e-mails. My personal choice of food porn, every morning.

The vibe in the back is slightly different from the front; a little closer to the heart of the action. Plus, all the better to admire the Ruby Watch Co. sign, which is by far, the most arresting fixture in the restaurant. That, or Chef Lynn, herself.

So if she's inviting you over for dinner, you can't turn her down. Nor, would you want to ;)",4.0
"When I'm told about a movie that is amazing, friends tell me about that same movie that completely changed their lives, there is media hype, I build up a certain expectation for my own experience.  More often than not, it falls far short. 

Ruby Watch Co. I have lived in Leslieville for a couple of years, and the name has come up more than a couple of times. For whatever reason, I have not had the pleasure of dining in this establishment until now. Tonight was the night.

Being completely hopeless with directions, my dining companion and I were relying heavily on the map on my iphone. Even though I'm quite familiar with the area, I just could not visualize where it was. The little pin was totally not where Ruby actually was! There is only so many times that one can walk past Jilly's without feeling somewhat...odd. 

Needless to say, we regained our bearings, and strolled in to meet our friends exactly on time for our reservation.  It was only 6:30 and the place was fairly humming with happy patrons. Our waiter greeted us in a timely fashion, giving us time to take off our jackets and say our hellos. 

The best thing about the prix fixe menu is the only thing you have to think about is what you are drinking. I had my standard vodka soda, which I have to say was served in a lovely shaped glass.  I felt a little rushed with the wine that we ordered with our meal, but I attribute it to the attentiveness of our server. (I was, after all, a little behind in drinking my pre-dinner cocktail).  I chose the wine based on the suggestion of pairing on the main.
The (red) wine had subtle fruity undertones with a smoky punch. I wish I could remember the name.  

Our first course was a wedge of iceberg lettuce with egg, delightfully sliced radish, thickly cut bacon (I'm sure they called it something else), oven kissed tomato with one thousand and one island dressing. The extra island was for the chili heat that they added to the dressing. Refreshing, delicious, certainly got me salivating. 

They also served chive and cheddar biscuits with the salad. They were still warm, broke apart perfectly in half, and were absolutely amazing. I could have eaten 17 of them. I probably will be dreaming about them tonight. 

The servers swooped in and cleared our (licked clean) plates in the most unobtrusive manner. Our glasses were carefully monitored and topped when needed. 

The main arrived. I'm ten years past the acronym generation but OMG. We had black kale (described on the menu as winter greens with creamed brown butter sauce, butternut squash with pumpkin seed pesto, smashed potato with shallots and blue cheese, and....beef flank, seared to perfection, with this wonderful smoky flavour that wasn't overbearing. It showcased the flavour of the beef. Seriously, it made my toes curl. The only thing that I could find wrong with this meal was that the meat was a little cold. Sadness. Very difficult to control though, as the room had a little bit of a cold breeze, and the meat was obviously intended to be served a certain way.  Our server dropped in and made sure that everyone got some of the delicious jus on their plate. 

Third Course; in preparation for the dessert, we received some sort of mild and sweet cheese (I didn't remember the name of the wine, I'm certainly not going to remember the name of the cheese after all that diligent glass topping). Along with the cheese, lightly toasted bread and fruity chutney rounded out the plate. 

Our friend (the birthday girl, the reason we went out) happened to not care for chocolate cake, which was being served as the dessert.  Our server accommodated her eagerly, and gave her a beautifully poached pear with cranberry and a sparkler. He even snapped a picture with his blackberry, handed it to me, and told me to email it to myself and my friends! The chocolate ganache was to die for.  

My only other complaint of the night was when I ordered an espresso, and they didn't have any Sambuca to go with it. The espresso was quite good. 

The place was tastefully decorated and down to earth, eclectic yet homely. Even in the washroom, the toilet paper rolled on a ""pipe"" that was crafted to appear as though it was some plumbing that went awry. Awesome!

All in all, a great night. Lynn Crawford was busy helping cleaning tables to turn them as we left, which is quite admirable!! Nice guys/gals don't always finish last!  I am delighted to be surprised that Ruby Watch Co. lived up to all of the hype and then some.",4.0

"2.5/5, +.5 for service

Mo'Ramyun used to be called McRamyun before, you guessed it, McDonald's complained about their name and they had to change it to Mo'Ramyun. Either way, it's a Korean fusion restaurant in Baldwin Village with your typical Korean staples and snacks.

I arrived here for lunch recently as I've been past this place a couple of times and it intrigued me a bit. I've always liked ramyun, except the fact I dislike the spiciness that comes with it. Looking at the menu beforehand, there were some ramyun items that interested me which weren't spicy at all, so I decided to give this place a try.

I had the Don-Gol Ramyun, which was supposedly a thick pork/chicken broth with garlic, pork belly, and pickled radish. The garlic came separate, which is nice if you're not someone who likes a lot of garlic in their soups. For $10.95, however, I expected a little bit more from what I got. The pork belly was decent and the ramyun was average (felt more like instant noodles though), but the broth was not thick at all and a bit on the salty side. I can understand pork bones being a bit on the salty edge, but that was way too salty for my liking.

For what it's worth, service was excellent and the workers really do try to make you feel welcome. I might consider trying other items, but given the options around the area this will not be my first choice to revisit.",3.0

As a person with no kids, I'm fine with Chandler's ""no children under 12 allowed"" rule.  It's for the dogs, not the kids.  Plus, I don't want your kid running into my dog's teeth.  Ask me again in a few years when I have kids myself, though. . .",3.0

They offer all day breakfast but there's some hamburgers on there for those non breaky type. 
Standard I ordered eggs Benny (someone wise told me you can screw up eggs Benny. I just didn't think at an all day breakfast joint could)
Soft poached egg ended up...well...was what Gordon Ramsey would yell at someone for. The hollandaise sauce was alright, maybe just a tad too thick but taste was ok. I think the saving grace was the home fries. Those were totally cooked though. Nice and soft in the middle yet the outside had a very slight crunch but not burnt or dry.

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

"Let me start by saying different restaurants cater to different taste, and Pho Do Thi being a Vietnamese restaurant does not cater to the traditional Vietnamese Palette. I ordered the grilled chicken Com Tam which was actually not grilled by deep fried and the rice was regular full grain jasmine rice and not the proper broken rice as per the namesake of the dish. The Dish lacked any flavour and I could only imagine eating something of this quality if it was 1 AM and I was seriously intoxicated. We also ordered the Pho Dac Biet the staple of any authentic Vietnamese establishment. A Pho broth should have complex flavours/aromas and be full bodied resulting from a days worth of bone marrow simmering in a pot. The Pho here tasted like Sugar water and MSG equivalent to that of an MAMA instant noodle bag - so set your expectations accordingly.

Looking around I saw mostly Non Asian patrons which is fine but this is a clear sign Pho Do Thi  does not cater to the traditional Vietnamese flavors and is more akin to a Manchu Wok dining experience of Westernized Low quality Vietnamese food. Please do not eat this and call it Vietnamese food...",2.0

They have a really good walk-in special for a 2 topping XL pizza for $18.  The nice thing is that it's actually a true extra large and you get a TON of 'zza for your money.  Took about 20 minutes for my walk-in order to prepared and the end result was very tasty.

"I used to come here all the time with my mom but I stopped going because I couldn't stand the atmosphere or how terrible my nails were looking. It got to the point that I would only go there because it was closest nail salon to me and I just wanted to get in and get out. They clearly cared more about your money than doing quality work. They never listened to my requests, if it was something they didn't like personally they would try and talk me out of it. I was never impressed with their acrylic nails, in fact, whenever I said I wanted almond nails Lynn tried to talk me out of it because ""she didn't like doing them"" and she would say they weren't cute and her husband would rush and make them too thin, then when they broke and I came to get it fixed he would blame it on me. Lynn would always tease me about the color nail polish I picked out, she would always try to make me get a pedicure even after I said to stop asking. When appointments were made, she would take walk-ins before us because she didn't want to lose money obviously by having people walk out, once we waited almost an hour even though we had an appointment. Very shady atmosphere and I wouldn't waste your time or money honestly. All they do is up-sell you, lie, make you feel stupid, they're pushy, and they do lousy nails.",1.0

"Over a week we visited d&b three times (mon, wed, & sat) while we stayed at the Marriott resort down the street. Kids (9 and 11) loved it as we only visit once every 2 months normally. Place was bigger than the ones we have visited on the east coast, though this is due to more dining spaces, special party rooms, platinum bar, patio dining.  Games were about the same. Except half price Wednesday,  the crowd was about the same. One thing, the ticket redemption center had fewer prizes, less variety and poorer quality than othrr d&b sites.

Please beware i went to try to get a refund and the employee told me I was not going to get my money back. I own a car dealer and was taking at least 10 cars a week. Will never come back to this business again. Bunch of scammers, if you want to keep customers don't lien to them.",1.0
"Decided to try something other than sushi combo for lunch today.

I was thinking of getting the spicy korean beef noodles, but my buddy ordered that - can't order the same thing...so I was looking at the chicken katsu noticed it came with rice, or, in the Don Katsu Bowl (or something like that).  That was chicken katsu with a basted egg on top of it, with onions and rice.  That was a nice way to dress up chicken katsu!

Ended up liking that better - will have to come back and try some more of the other-than-sushi dishes.",4.0
"I absolutely love Chef on the Road.  I typically get his meals once a week, unless he has multiple of my favorites in the same week.  I High recommend the baked ziti with garlic bread, grilled chicken and pasta with creamy pesto and Parmesan, as well as the chicken salad on croissant.  Those are my favorites, but I honestly have not had a bad meal from him!  There are also several options.  There are hot meals, salads, sandwich and soup combinations, etc.  The menu is posted so you can look and plan ahead also!",5.0
"I really want to like this place since this area needs more coffee shops. First, the layout is a bit odd, you order from one side of the room and then have to walk across to pick it up. I find that is where communication issues may arise, although they're just newly opened when I came so maybe they've sort out this kink since. My boyfriend ordered an Americano with a request for less water, and they didn't really know how to input it; the only other way would be to yell it across the room I guess? I had a cappuccino which came out way too hot. The flavour was okay at best, but I couldn't really taste the espresso. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",2.0

"The Overlook Grill is located on level 4 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. It's location is fine - next to the pool areas but not so close that you would be bothered by anything happening there.

I ordered a cheesesteak panini which was surprisingly decent. Not the best cheesesteak sandwich I ever had, but certainly above average for this sort of thing.

Price was $18. Not worth that amount of money, but we *are* on the strip, and everything is expensive here so I don't know how much weight I should give to the pricing structure. 

The only thing I would complain about is that it seemed like they took awhile (30 minutes) to get my food out, which was just the sandwich with fries, but then again, everything is supposed to be fresh and cooked to order so maybe this isn't a big deal.

Bottom line: if you are looking for a laid-back lunch and you are in the Cosmopolitan/Bellagio area, give them a shot.",3.0
"This restaurant has deceivingly beautiful decor. Looks like a nice restaurant, comparable to The Keg, but the cheap prices of their food matches the quality.

"I really wanted to give this place a good review, but our experience wasn't the best. The two stars are for the food, but service was horrible. 

Keep in mind: 
- Tables of 6 and over cannot split the bill, and a 17% gratuity is added.
- This place is super popular, but medium sized. If you come at peak hours (7PM) there will be crowding and quite a long wait. You might have to wait on the stairs. 
- Try to call earlier in the day to reserve a table, especially if you're in a big group! 

Service: Made a reservation for 7PM. When we arrived, we were told we would've seated in a few minutes as they were setting up our table. 20 minutes pass, and we ask for a status update, in which the hostess apologized and said it wouldn't be too much later. At 7:40, we were seated. After another half hour, a waiter came to take our orders. Another 40 minutes later, our food arrived. It took almost an hour and a half for us to finally get our food, which really dampened the mood as my group had been waiting all day to eat at this place! My experience was almost identical a previous Yelper's review of the service. Two tables beside us were seated, served, and left before we had finished our meals. The waiter ignored us and didn't check up on us at all, or come over to take our order! We had to flag him down every time!! We were really put off by the 17% gratuity because it was not deserved at all but paid anyway as it was getting so late and we needed to catch our trains home. 

Food: The dishes were great, and I wish we didn't have to wait so long to finally get our meals. I ordered the chicken Pad Thai with mild spice, and it was absolutely delicious. I also ordered a thai tea, which was the perfect mix of sweet and creamy. The calamari was delicious, and my friend's curried noodle soup was beautiful - a balanced blend of spice and creaminess. 

Tldr: service was so slow (1.5 hr wait until we got our food), waiter ignored us, but the food was fantastic!",2.0
"I paid for a groupon to have my car re tinted at Capital Tint yesterday.

I'd like to say that the process from start to finish was awesome.  I called and made my appointment with David, after bringing in the car, Nato came out and looked at my current tint which had faded purple.

He let me know that there would be a charge to remove the tint (took about 3 hour for removal as it was 10+ year old tint and the back window came off in pieces).  He then walked me through all the different options of tint and I decided to go for an upgraded version due to the warranty. 

I will say the whole process didn't feel salesy at all. I felt like I got a genuine recommendation on the best option and the price was extremely fair for the work their team had to go through to remove the old and put on the new.

I also got to see them put on some of the new tint and the techs were extremely careful as to not get close to the paint with any tools and I could tell that they took pride in their work.

Specifically I saw one of the techs switch his tool belt from one side of his waist to the other as he went to the opposite side of the car so that there would be no chance of a tool coming into contact with my car.

Overall the process took about 5 hours but I was happy to wait because I felt the quality of work was top notch.

Nice job fellas, i'll be back.

p.s. the waiting room couches are pretty comfortable",5.0
"The young lady that answers their calls doesn't know enough about their business to answer simple customer questions.

Had never heard of this place before but my husband and I were in the area and found it on Yelp.  It's very small with not much seating but the food didn't disappoint. My husband got the garlic steak and I got the steak and mushrooms--both came with a side salad of mixed greens and brown rice. The quality of the steak was good and it was well seasoned. I like that they had liquid aminos instead of soy sauce. Everything tastes good and was very healthy!!,5.0

"Liars work here, be careful

I had my car towed in there at the beginning of July because the engine had seized (my fault). The car was due to be returned at the end of its lease. I found out on July 21st that they were trying to get ahold of my friend (person that got it towed for me since I live in Cali) to figure out what is going on with the car. I flew into Las Vegas for the day on the 29th in order to try to get this resolved. Spoke to Sergio who was handling it, and he introduced me to the service manager who went over the cost of repairs. After getting that figure I went back to Sergio to see what other options I had. My friend who towed the car in was in the market for a car as well.  My options on the 29th were to turn car in as is ~$8,000, fix and turn in ~$7,500, or trade it in and have my friend purchase a vehicle to help cover the fees on the trade. My friend went in that weekend to do a credit check and was told he would need to look for a car around $30k to mask the penalty on the trade. 

We've both tried numerous times since that weekend to get ahold of him and even tried talking to Sales Managers only to be blown off and sent to Dummy voicemails. No VMs have been returned. 

I called Kia Lease End Services yesterday to explain I was trying to handle the trade in and explained all of this. Tasha was able to get Sergio on the phone magically (maybe my phone number didn't show up??) and she was told that they just found of they had the car last week and they've been bending over backwards to help my friend or me take care of this issue but we are wasting their time and dodging them. I tried explaining to Tasha that they are lying and I have flight records, phone calls, witnesses that drove me over there (family), but now they are just going to ""ground the car"" because we've been non-compliant. 

These people are crooks and I will be taking this as high as I can go, up to the State Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau because I have all the evidence to prove they were lying about what they told the agent on the phone.",1.0

"My mother and I spotted this on our way to WalMart and decided to stop in for dinner.  The resulting experience was mind-blowing, to say the least.

First of a, let me say that this is INDIAN FOOD.  Not American-spiced food of questionably Indian origin.  When you order mild, it will burn the hair out of your nostrils.  When you order medium, you will breathe fire.  No one at my table was brave enough to order full spice.  With that being said, the flavors are luxuriant to the point of feeling pampered.  Their seasonal vegetable korma - I confess, korma is my go-to dish - is creamy, full-flavored and robust.  A pleasant surprise was the paneer contained within!  It had the texture of a really tender chicken breast, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mistake!  No mistake, though - just perfectly cooked meat substitutes, the quality of which could make the culinary gods shed a proud tear.

And their unusual cocktails are awesome, too!  I tried the guava margarita, and I would have gladly put them away until my family had to drag me from A to B if it weren't for my budget.  Sigh - next time.",5.0

The band was a pretty fair cover band.  Overall, I would go back any time.

"My husband and I went to Postino for a dinner date during a recent weekend trip to Phoenix. It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.

Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.

Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.

Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.

We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.",5.0

"My wife and I went last night for the first time, and it was great! Just because something does not have reviews does not mean you should avoid it like the plague. The Createry has been up and running for about a year, and Molly is the owner. Which might explain why there aren't many reviews, and also, people tend to complain more than compliment.

Anyways, back to The Createry. Molly is the owner, and she did the session that we attended. She starts off with introducing herself and talks about the company/organization and then shows what the painting of the night is (which is on the Event Calendar). She also encourages you to go your own route, there are no limitations for creativity. You don't even have to do what is being demonstrated. When walking through the painting, she shows what needs to be done instead of just telling you so that both types of learners can understand. When it comes to colors, once again, she does not care what you do because it is your painting. She is willing to offer advice if you need it, or help mix colors if you can't quite get to it. She is very patient, but also fun to be around.

The concept of having this in a restaurant is a wonderful thing, but can also get quite pricey if you are buying drinks and food when you add in the cost for attending the event itself (our total cost ended up being over $100 when we added in the cost for the Groupon). But, do not let that discourage you.

The site is well laid out and the Event Calendar will show you the date, time, location, cost, and painting that will be there, and it is not hard to miss. Also, the FAQ lays out the rules and guidelines when it comes to not being able to make it to an event.

Overall, great thing that we went! Plan to be there for longer than 2 hours, because your creativity may take you a different route. Also, I highly recommend getting a Groupon, Living Social deal, etc. because I'm sure you don't want to justify why you can't enjoy the night. Definite recommendation.",5.0

I would describe Salon de Elephant itself is a relaxing experience. It's not very often that you will find a professional who really cares and puts a lot of effort into all the little details, and I think Karen does a really good job on that. 

The place takes appointments and walk-ins, but I would recommend booking ahead of time (They have online booking!), since they do get quite busy and most of the time u may not able to have your service on the same visit. 

Book your cut with Karen and you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"I got to Cleveland early for my conference and was able to make a stop for lunch. This place was a bit of a trek from the conference center, but it was well worth the walk! It was also a plus that they offered WiFi.

Unfortunately, this was a Tuesday after a long weekend, and a few items on the menu weren't available because many of their ingredients are very perishable and they hadn't had a chance to restock. I settled on the lean green smoothie, the awesome grilled cheese, and the creamy rotini bake. (The latter two could really be lunches for two different people, but I couldn't resist over-ordering on purpose.) You really can't tell this is vegan food, and they have some unique offerings. I especially loved the fig jam in the grilled cheese that added a tang of sweetness to the sandwich. I also found the pricing to be super fair, considering the natural ingredients.

The reason I'm docking a star is that this cafe really needs more than one person working, especially around the lunch rush. The poor employee was literally taking orders and then running around the kitchen trying to make the food at the same time. I wanted a takeout box, and it took me a long time to get her attention. There was another customer who came in, waited for 10 min without being acknowledged, and walked out.

Other than the understaffing issues, this place was such a treat. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area again!",4.0
Tried this place on a because my wife and I were given a restaurant.com gift cert for it when it was in Avon and had an absolutely terrible experience. Service was unbelievably slow and the food was OK at best. The worst part of the night was when they told us that they no longer accepted the gift certificate! Within a few weeks this place was closed only to reopen in Cleveland. If it has the same owner and the service staff it won't in Cleveland long either.,1.0
"Being from California with so many options for Filipino food, Filipino food restaurants in AZ is very scarce. So when I found this place, i was thrilled! Their food is great and authentic and the workers are really nice. The only reason why I marked one star off is because it was so expensive. Just for my meal alone was $17!!! I got three items: Sisig, Beef Steaf and Caldereta. I was shocked it costed that much. But the food items were delicious!!",4.0
"Highly recommend this shop for all your firearm needs, from brand new guns to transfers to accessories. Dave and Ted are extremely helpful and friendly, and just as important, knowledgeable. I just moved to Vegas from out of state, and they handled all my firearm transfers flawlessly.

"There are times in life when spending the rent money on a single meal is actually a pleasure, and can be part of one of those evenings that's the stuff of special memories for years to come.  

There is a bare handful of truly first-class, exquisite, opulent places in Toronto where your dining experience is so much more than food on a plate, where only the finest in your wardrobe will suit you, where you want to make marriage proposals or celebrate a major anniversary or otherwise ritually mark the most sublime and special of occasions in life.  When I know I'm going to plan such an evening with a special partner, it's the Courthouse Market Grille that I personally keep in my back pocket.  

I don't have to tell you what's on the menu, but I'll definitely recommend their steaks.  You should already know that it'll be among the best meals you'll hope to have.  Ever.  Trust me.",5.0

"In a word, this restaurant is simply fabulous. I've not been to other Nobu restaurants, but I can't imagine them being chicer than this. Multicultural waiters barking out orders in Japanese to the swift and focused sushi chefs, ultra trendy and modern decor, gorgeous breezy open space... And creative, masterfully prepared food to boot.

Not quite five stars since Nobu is actually no place for the sushi purist - I've had FAR better sake belly (my all time hands down favorite cut of fish), let alone regular sake, elsewhere - and service certainly could've been more attentive. Also I should state the obvious that you better be prepared to drop serious cash on your meal since dishes aren't served with garnishes or accompaniments (unless you don't mind eating pure protein). That said, my black cod miso was phenomenal and easily one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had (only behind the halibut at 3 Michelin star le Bernadin in NYC). The more-sweet-than-savory miso glaze enveloped the outer flesh of the fish in a perfectly caramelized crust, and yet somehow the meat was barely cooked to achieve an unbelievably juicy tenderness. It was actually so moist that the layers of flaky flesh simply slid off of one another and into puddles of juice upon the gentlest prod of the fork and dissolved onto the tongue. Not to mention the serving size was surprisingly HUGE - easily 6+ ounces.

Would def return with a big group and go all out. Def not the place to go if you're on a conservative work budget (like me).",4.0

"Went to Big-O off 215/Gibson for service this past weekend and had a great experience. This is the second time I've been to this location. 
I chose to go to them again after I was quoted 89.99 for a synthetic oil change from the Chevy dealership just up the street (Henderson Chevy), I called Big-O and they offered the same job for $39.99. 
Got the oil change, tire rotation/balance, rear brakes/rotors, and the price was less than half of what the Chevy dealer would charge. Took about half the time as well. 
Friendly service, clean, easy to get to location just off the 215. Would recommend to anyone, I will be back for sure.",5.0

"Awesome local little spot with a view of the strip. Gaming, pool, darts Cozys has it. Had a great experience here with a couple friends.

Great spot and great friendly bartender... Karla was the bartender and she was really down to earth and chill. Made me feel right at home. Signed n
Me up for players points and I got a free $20 to play with! She was busy as hell and still made it around to each of the guests and made sure they were hydrated. Hard to do that when it's packed and yer the only one, but she handled the place no prob!

They serve food here too! 24 hrs!

Great first experience at an old las vegas hangout.

"Pottery Barn is a nice serene store. Kind helpful employees, but not intrusive. I enjoy walking through when at the Biltmore, Alas for me the merchandise is geared toward folks who have yet to develop a personal style. Very generic in design for the most part.

"After getting tuned onto the deliciousness that is ramen during a stay in LA's Little Tokyo, I've been a hale and hearty adventurer on a vegetarian RamenQuest™ ever since!

The oft mentioned pinnacle of my quest here in Las Vegas is Miko's - who provide vegetarians with their own special menu featuring a vast variety of vegetarian rolls, udon, and yes - that most elusive of vegetarian dishes - ramen noodle soup that is not made with pork, beef or chicken broth.

MIko's did not disappoint!  The broth was deeply flavored and tasted like, well, like they craft their food with care and quality.  The noodles were thin and had great texture, while the veggies (which change from day-to-day from what I understand) mostly peas, spinach and asparagus this time - had been slightly roasted and caramelized then cooked until crisp tender. Perfect.  A friend ordered the vegetarian sukiyaki and it looked amazing - something new to try for next time.

The only minuses were the food took a really long time to come out of the kitchen - and the place wasn't that busy on a Sunday evening.  My husband ordered the Veggie Tempura roll and while he said it was tasty, it was one of those super large sliced rolls that is so loosely packed it's impossible to pick it up with just chopsticks, or your fingers for that matter, without it completely falling apart.  I didn't even try...

Overall I highly recommend Miko's to those on a veggie forage voyage.  A really, really nice stop-over on the RamenQuest™ journey.",4.0

"This place is a solid 3 star...and that is a compliment from before. In the past, this place has had mediocre food and horrible service; grumpy servers, unconventional rules and rude comments. The last time I unwillingly came, I was pleasantly surprised by a lack of rudeness.
And this visit was the same. Ignoring the past (which is difficult to do), I agree with other reviews that the food is acceptable.
Coming in, I expected a quick dinner of gamjatang for myself and kimchi jigae for my wife, a combination that we have had a million times the world over. And we were not disappointed because we expected the msg taste in the broth and minimal interaction with the staff. I was pleasantly surprise with 7 side dishes and no problems with the refills.

Solid 3 stars if nothing else changes. However, I would only come here if Food Express in the food court was closed and I didn't want to drive to Yonge St.",3.0

"We had our family reunion in Vegas this year.  As we were planning our dinner, we decided to try Buca di Beppo.  Since we had a large party (40), we wanted a place that was family friendly, could cater a large group, and off the strip.  I worked with Trish.   She was awesome, very flexible and responsive. She also suggested entrees that were popular for our banquet dinner.  When we arrived, our table was set up.  As our party straggled in, the servers were greeted everyone and made sure folks had their drinks.  I was worried about the food but the servers and kitchen staff planned this nicely.  Everything was smooth for our dinner.  Thanks Buca Staff...",5.0
"Happy hour goes from 5-7pm! That alone should give Ocean Prime a double thumbs up, because who can get to HH in the common 4-6pm time frame and a majority of the time, people are scrambling to get out of work early enough. 

Lesley, our server, was super attentive! After I had my typical go to, The Old Fashioned, which was good, I searched for something different so she suggested the Pine Fin Martini. They infuse their Finlandia Vodka with freshly cut pineapple which made for a cool refreshing simple cocktail.

So starting with the HH menu:
The $8 appetizers we ordered included..
Tuna Tartare Tacos - fresh tuna in ginger ponzu, avocado blanketed in thin crispy tacos (the type of crispy on crab wantons). Can't really go wrong ordering these. 

Oysters - cute little oysters served on ice. Little and ""oystery"" in flavor. 

The $5 appetizers we had..
Parmesan truffle fries - mild truffle taste. Maybe too mild?

Imported meat and cheese platter - good typical platter with 3 types of cheese. I had to guess which ones though since no description was included.

Kobe beef sliders - I don't recall if there was anything unique about the taste because there were only 2 of them and I ate mine in 3 bites. I remember it being good. 

Off the main menu, my friend and I split the:
Sea Scallop entree with Parmesan risotto - the scallops were pillowy and appeared to be lightly seared. Tender bites with not one hint of chewy texture. Lightly salted and buttered. The risotto had a hint of citrus in its sauce which was also very mild, so you had to almost pause and think about the citrus taste. 

I'd like to return here with my hubby for dinner sometime. I've heard great things about their steaks/meats here. From sharing the scallop entree with my friend and enjoying the tuna tartare and oysters, you can tell the seafood is indeed fresh. I felt like a lot of the HH appetizers served their job as ""higher end"" favorites but not super unique in any way. They tasted really good but looking over the appetizer menu on the main menu, one could tell a lot more heart and creativity was placed there. The entrees on the main menu appear to use unique ingredients that enhance the flavor of the meats and seafoods available without overpowering them. I can't wait to try them and see if my predictions are true!",4.0
My husband and I really like coming here. Mushroom walnut spinach soup is fantastic but not consistent. Some days it's pureed (and it's the best) and others it's brothy and chunky (not great...).

"Wow their monster pizza is just that it is a MONSTER! It's ginormous! Definitely something fun to order for a super bowl party or get together of friends. The pizza was pretty good. They didn't skimp on the toppings which is nice but it wasn't my favorite. The crust was a little soggy for my liking and they put the brocolli stems as a topping as  well. Usually you have just the florets but they chopped up the stems and put them on their like soggy bell pepper. Kind of weird. 

We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks which were okay, they tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store. The fried mushrooms weren't very good, half were overcooked/burnt. The potato skins were dried out and lacked flavor. I did enjoy the Italian wedding soup though. It has good flavor and tons of pasta and meatballs. 

Probably wouldn't order delivery from them again considering that the only thing I enjoyed was the soup.",2.0
"I finally gave Sprinkles a chance. One star for interior decoration and another star for decent service. I'm pretty picky when it comes to cupcakes, but I came out of here thinking that I could make myself a better cupcake with my own oven/kitchen. The cake itself was really dry and crumbly and I'm not really a fan of thick icing. Maybe I should have tried their ice cream or sandwich, but with just their basic cupcake really lacking, I'm not sure the specialty treats would have been too much better. However, I would say try it out for yourself, see if you like cupcakes made the Sprinkles way!",2.0

My cuticles were not trimmed correctly either.  I had to do them myself at home.   I requested a french pedicure.  It is thick and uneven.  Very disappointed that I wasted time and money.

I don't know what it is with  the lady that works there, she just seems so miserable and everything you ask or want to know about the shoes makes you feel like you're causing her to be in pain... 
I'm going to try going to their Henderson location one of these days so that that I can maybe meet someone who will let me take my time as I try on the different shoes, and hopefully end up buying a pair.",2.0

At the appointment, the receptionists and hygienists were extremely personable and friendly, and made this a whole lot less stressful than normal. The ONLY reason I am giving 4/5 is because of the time I spent with the doctor (unfortunately I do not know his name, as he didn't even introduce himself). He seemed very rushed throughout out 7 minutes together, and did not seem to want to answer my questions that I had. However, he seemed extremely knowledgeable and practical, so I can't complain too much! Overall, wonderful experience here!",4.0

"Wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet, I stopped by China Chili in Central Phoenix. The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. 

Menu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. 

The Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.

Overall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either. If you want Chinese food that has a little more class that doesn't kill your paycheck check out China Chili.",4.0

"I have eaten at Uncle Sam's periodically since 1991. Today was my last time. We attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser. I handed the server the card when I ordered. Only after we were done eating she came over with the check and informed us that we couldn't use the card as the single Pepsi didn't count towards the ""food order."" I had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the ""owner's orders."" I asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amount but being just $2.00 short in the ""food cost."" He essentially told me that if that was how I felt he couldn't do anything about it ""owner's orders."" If they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as I couldn't read the fine print even with reading glasses, and the server should have informed me of the fact when I ordered not after the meal was consumed. Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business. (The soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them, so the inflexible policy is inane.)

On another note the sandwiches are quite good although I can easily make a better Philly Cheesesteak at home. The pizza and wings are merely average. If you want far better wings go, to Sardella's.",2.0
"I love this place. The pizza is great, that's all I ever get when I go here. We like to go after 9pm for their $1 domestic drafts and $1.25 premiums. Pitchers are great too, I think it's $4 for domestic and $5 for premium! Blue Moon tastes so much better for that price! Haha

The girls that serve are all really nice, we made friends with one and love it when she's there. The patio is pretty blah, just some tables in front of the bar, but most of the people in our group are smokers so it's chill to hang there (especially because no one else sits out there.) 

My one and only complaint, and the reason it only gets 4 out of 5 stars, is because they close at 11. That makes it somewhat of a pre-gaming spot for us, but with those prices it's not that bad! I know it's a restaurant primarily, but they'd get one he'll of a night crowd if they kept it open til 12 or 1 at least.",4.0
"Eeeek! I really hope this place gets better, since the location is killer- Walnut St proper.  The signage outside is super adorable a well, but alas.....

Out of the 9 favors ""available"" on the wall of yogurt dispensers (in the Razzy Fresh tradition) only 4 were available: boring old vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and original (which is my personal fave anyway, so I didn't mind). But all the other flavors had this crude, handwritten sign, a post-it actually, above them that said ""ask for"". The square hole where the machine should be was empty, except for a taped up black garbage bag. The 2 employees that were there (one I suspect was the owner) didn't seem very equipped to answer anything I would ""ask"", so I just went with my old standby + kiwi. When I asked for a cup of water with my order, I got a blank stare, then a small styrofoam cup filled halfway with WARM water. The smell of cheap cleaner mixed with ammonia hung in the air.

As I type this the fella at the counter has continued to stare into space, or at an unforeseen speck of something on the far wall. No blinking. For about 5 minutes. True story.

"Arrived on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Had to see what all the hypes about. Fusion food and Filipino dishes sounded great. 

When you first arrive, instant home comfort feel restaurant. The Tiffany blue accented colours were satisfying to look at, the modern furniture adds a great atmosphere to the restaurant. Once we arrived, we waited for 10 mins to sit, understandable for it being a beautiful Saturday afternoon. 

But let's be transparent: 
Fancy furniture and bright colours doesn't equal to good food or service. 

First order meal:
The Flip Side: Home made longanisa, crunchy garlic rice & fried rice. This is a traditional Filipino ""brunch"" dish. I give this restaurant a high five for introducing Filipino dishes. Rare to find. As for flavours, the taste gave a similar taste to the traditional longanisa sausage but being Filipino myself, it was very mediocre. I'd suggest if you haven't had longanisa in the past, this dish will set a low standard to introduce Filipino foods. It was okay, we did ask the waitress to cook our egg with no yolk... And it came extremely runny.

Second dish:
The Polski Benedict: Potato Placki w/ vodka cured salmon or peameal bacon. Poached egg & Hollandaise sauce. I chose the salmon. Great dish, very tasty. I asked for hot sauce and they surprisingly gave me a large selection to choose from. Awesome fusion between mixing hot sauces with Hollandaise sauce and the yolk. I'd have this dish again.

The bad:
Asked for coffee, requested 3 times for a refill. One of the waitresses asked, brought the coffee out to another table and I'll assume she forgot about us. Reminding her again, she said she'll brew more...after 10 mins we decided to just get the bill and leave. Once paying, we shared our feedback and it was an immediate apology, we still ended up paying $2.50 for a ""bottomless"" coffee as they say, but it was disappointing service... good luck getting a refill on your water. 

We came for the hype and left disappointed. It's great for families and mediocre food, but I won't be coming back to this restaurant. 

Better service, higher attention to details with their customers and an introduction to their menu with knowing the names of the servers would be appreciated for future customers.",2.0

"Met up with some friends on a Saturday afternoon after adulting real hard and running errands all day.

Lets say I got there between 3:00-4:00 ... they were not packed by any means. We were there for drinks and socialization and for some reason, we were told we could not have a server and had to order our drinks at the bar...??  Alright, Party of 8, without a server at one of the tables along the sidewalk. Awesome.

After a few hours we decided we wanted some food...requested a server for that component...after 20 minutes of waiting, we decided it was time to close out our tabs and go elsewhere since asking one of the many young ladies chatting around the bar to take our orders was a bit too much work...As you can imagine closing 6 tabs (some of our party were couples) took another 20 minutes and finally when the last tab was being closed a server came over to the table...

I had chicken teriyaki leftovers in the fridge & my mom ended up eating it. She ended up with the same symptoms so that's how I knew it was the chicken.

"Finally!  In every town, I'm always on the look-out for a great pub-style place - it has to be small but not tiny, have an interior with lots of character (exposed brick, dark wood paneling), a great beer selection, and a menu with decent non-meat options.  It's OK if it's got TVs for the game, but they can't be too obtrusive.  In Raleigh, I've got Mitch's.  In Columbia, I've got Hunter Gatherer.  Finally, finally, finally, I've found my Charlotte bar.

Growlers is all but perfect.  We went for the first time with a group of five and sat at one end of their wooden castle door table that could easily seat 15.  The bar tender willingly put the S. Carolina game on the TVs, and our server was clever, attentive, and supportive.  He fetched us a growler and carefully poured our glasses for us.  Among our group, several ordered the pretzel with spicy mustard; some ordered the italian sausage; some ordered the mac and cheese; some ordered the veggie sausage; and I got the poblano hummus.  All of it was great beer food, and the hummus had spice and flavor.  The pretzels are hot and soft.

One of the best part of the evening, however, were the dessert s'mores - a do-it-yourself special with the marshmellows drenched in grain alcohol and then set afire.  We ordered two and got our fingers gooey and chocolatey.

A few days later, we went back - just the two of us and a friend.  We sat in a booth this time and had pretzels and beer.  We had equally attentive service (granted, it was a Monday night and the place was pretty quiet), and the music was at a low enough level that it was easy to have a good conversation.

Thanks, Growlers.  I'll be back!",5.0

"Went to Blue Hound Kitchen just for dessert and cocktails! It's in the lobby of the beautiful Palomar Hotel at City Scape, a Kimpton Hotel. 

I have been to Blue Hound a couple of times for happy hour and have not been disappointed. I was definitely not disappointed for dessert. 

I had the ""Lost Melody"" cocktail which I have enjoyed on a previous visit. Made with pisco, coconut cream, rose flower water and a couple of other ingredients. Delicious. 

For dessert I had the chocolate pudding. Served in a jar with layers of graham crackers, chocolate pudding and marshmallow fluff. Vanilla ice cream and peanuts are served on the side. Oh so good! 

If you are just going for cocktails, snacks or desserts, sit in the lounge right off the lobby. Great for people watching! 

Enjoy!",5.0
"My hubby and I came here the other night for date night. It is in a small strip mall and honestly looks like a complete hole in the wall from the outside, but once you go in, it's a totally different world. The ambience is very romantic, everything is done in dark reds and they have their large wine selection on display beautifully. We don't drink, but we did eat and the food was incredible!!!!!! I suggest the homemade crab curry with glass noodles, it was divine! Very hot, just the way I like it. For dessert we had the sticky rice/mango dish and it was melt in the mouth amazing! Couldn't recommend this place highly enough!",5.0
"My friend made an appointment for both of us, based on the fact that I had been here previously. I arrived only to find out that my appointment had been canceled. Nobody called me, no apology was made for the inconvenience caused to me. The place was empty, except for one nail tech and their next appointment wasn't arriving for 30 minutes. I was still told by the individual at the front desk that no appointment would be available until the next day.  I went across the street and was accommodated promptly, politely and beautifully. I won't be returning or recommending this place. As someone who has an MBA, I have no idea how they stay in business. Disgusting.",1.0
"OH WOW! For those of you who don't know me, I am a pizza fanatic. Pizza all day every day forever. I love plain pizzas, specialty pizzas, small pizzas, sheet pizzas, deep dish pizzas, calzones, (which isn't really pizza but is pizza adjacent) and all other pizzas in between. You know who has all of the above? The Great American Pizza Co., that's who. 

I've never been overly picky about my pizza, but I can definitely appreciate an amazing one when I find it. This place has some of the best in the business. I don't say that lightly people. My boyfriend and I just happened to stumble across the name somewhere, and with him also being an avid pizza consumer, we had to try it out THAT DAY. I mean, it has ""great"" and ""American"" in the title, so it had to be amazing. They have pizzas inspired by different cities as specialties. I found that to be pretty cool and unique. 

We may have over done it a bit with the ordering, but with a BOGO  1/2 off sale, who can resist?! So we ordered the Bismarck, which has spaghetti and meatballs on it. Yes, you heard me correctly...ON the pizza. For our half off, we ordered the Key west with spinach, tomato and garlic. Then we, of course, had to order a deep dish pizza. Now, seeing as though we have indulged in real Chicago deep dishes before, we were skeptical. However, I can tell you that The GAPC rivals that of any Chicago one we've tasted. I realize that what I just said is crossing in to dangerous territory, so I'll elaborate. Of course Chicago's pizza is superior. I'm just saying that in Ohio, you can get supremely awesome deep dish without driving 5hours right here in little Brunswick. Man, is it good! 

I have always prided myself on being able to consume mass quantities of pizza in one sitting, but after one deep dish slice and one Bismarck, I was pretty full. Those are some heavy, albeit delicious, pizzas. I was slightly disappointed in the Key West until the next day, when I ate it cold. That makes a damn good cold pizza. There are so many to choose from and you bet your ass we'll be trying them all!",5.0
By me staying at the Linq this was one of my must do's in Vegas. I went there strictly for the smoked wings and I must say these were the best smoked wings I've ever had!!

"Had been wanting to try this place for a while after seeing the food truck around Oakland. The restaurant itself had a very warm and cute vibe going with all the christmas decorations. I ordered the Dusseldorf dog and my friends and I split a large Quebecoise poutine. 

My hot dog was pretty good. The grilled onions, horsey sauce, cranberry honey mustard, and bacon made a tasty but not too overpowering combination of toppings. My friend ordered the turkey dog oahu style and my friend ordered the tofu dog bangkok style. Both of their dogs were even smaller than mine which was pretty disappointing. The tofu dog had a weird consistency and no flavor. 

I was exctited to try the poutine but the gravy was very thick. The fries weren't too bad but we probably wasted half the large because it was so big and none of us really enjoyed it. Overall, I would come back for their hot dogs but maybe get two of them since they really are not that big.",3.0

"Was up in the area and despite friends telling me not to bother with this place, I decided to give it a try. I really wish I would've listened to them and will not be going back. The employees weren't really friendly, barely spoke any English and when I asked for the slice to go, it was almost an inconvenience for them to do so. They heated up the slice for a few seconds in the oven and it was maybe room temperature when I ate it a couple minutes later. The sauce was really bland and didn't have any flavor at all. I've never had such a bland slice of pizza and the price for what you get is ridiculous. I'm not sure what to rate lower, the pizza or the service.",1.0

"Table Tennis or Ping Pong? 

If you are a avid player or even a beginner, Canadian Chinese Table Tennis Association (CCTTA)  is a great club.

There are 35 tournment grade tables and I am talking about serious playing, maybe for some if you want to play in a competition they host or just come in to hit some balls.

It is opens from 7 days a week from 9:30 am to 10:30 pm.  

If you are a casual player, you can just get a day pass for $6 you can play as long as you want. 

If you are really into playing, then I would suggest the yearly membership for $300. You can play everyday by just dropping in with no additional fees.

People are friendly here, so don't be shy just ask if they want to play with you.

Since CCTTA has sponsorship from different levels of government and businesses, so they able to keep their membership fees reasonable and has been expanding since.",3.0
"Taste: I come here a lot after a late night out, so it 's always satisfying. A really diverse menu is offered here. The Spicy Tuna Handroll was good. I liked the added crunch of the taro chips in the handroll. I also tasted the Korean Fried Chicken which was seasoned very well, and the sweet and spicy sauce that coated the pieces was spot on. My favourite bite was the Eggplant Sangwich Doubledown because it was well balanced with the crunchy eggplant, and soft mozzarella and tomato. It was like a snack size eggplant lasagna!

Service: The servers and bartenders were nice and quick. Just expect for a small lineup on a nice night. The wait is never too long though (about 10-15 minutes).

Value: Most items on the menu are $5. Other than the oysters and some platters that they offer, their menu items range from $5 - $7. I think it's the perfect value for their snack size plates.

Ambiance: Although it is a small space and a little dark, I like the ambiance. It's a cool place to hang with good music always playing.",4.0
"I first discovered this place on a hot, sunny summer's day two years ago when all I wanted was a cool drink to cool me down (did I mention I was walking outside for over an hour on a HOT day?)
Seeing the sign for Chatime was the greatest thing that happened to me on that walk. 

The drinks are great! The service can be slow at times, and I have definitely had better bubble tea, but Chatime definitely holds a close place to my heart ever since that hot sunny day. 

Going in the evening (between 6-8) and later on in the night (after midnight) usually guarantees short, if any lines. 

Roasted tea latte, earl grey latte and mango green tea are amongst some of my favourites!",4.0
"Very clean hotel!  The room was nice and spacious.  Great view of the strip from our room. We were also able to watch the Riveria implosion from our room which was a fun experience!  
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The bartender opened my bottle of wine for me because I didn't have a corkscrew and even gave me plastic cups so I could enjoy my wine by the pool (no glass allowed up there).  They serve Starbucks coffee and are able to make a limited menu of speciality coffees which was very nice. The pool is average size and only goes up to 4 ft in depth, but it was perfect for us as we had small children in our group. Would definitely stay here again.   The only negative thing is the free breakfast buffet closes at 9 am on weekdays and 930 on the weekend. I think maybe 10 or 1030 would be a better closing time. The buffet did have a good selection of items and we are there every morning of our stay.",4.0
"I'm a little torn on this because the property, including both the Wynn side and Encore side is great.  Great restaurants, casino, clubs, shops.  

The negative is that the Wynn tower is starting to show its age.  Room was a little basic with a small older tv.  No real extra amenities in a 'panaroma' room.  For the price, you'd do better elsewhere just room wise.  Also, no turn-down service even though its a 5-star hotel?!  

That said, its still a solid room and the property itself is just awesome.  Encore rooms are nicer though.",4.0

"Okay, so I`m still not bold enough to try the kangaroo or rabbit, but impressed with the range of MEAT selections they have here. Pair these charred links of meat with a great selection of dipping sauces (like roasted garlic chipotle, wasabi, parm chive etc.), a sampler of beer, and the crispiest fries I`ve had in a long time, and WVRST is the place for me!

Again, I played it safe and just went with a Calabrese Pork on a bun - since I`m a fan of sour and spice, I added sauerkraut and sauteed jalapenos. You can also get the sausages on a plate with garlic bread . Beer samplers come with descriptions, which is always nice...Again, fries so crisp I had absolutely no choice but to have two orders.

You have a choice of four or five savory sauces, watch the spicyness, you can choose from 1-5. If you're not used to spicy food's, start low and work your way up. FYI, you have to peel the shrimp, it's all part of the experience.

"I can't believe we ate so much. First time here and will definitely come back!

You order by the pound and everything comes in their own bag of juices. Plastic utensils and no plates and paper towel rolls.  Can't be ashamed of leaving carcasses on the table.  Reasonable prices. 

Don't bring your friends that can't handle seeing the heads of seafood. Although my favorite part someone at another table couldn't handle it and their whole party left cause of him. Such a shame.   They do have chicken fingers for the non-seafood eaters.

We ordered
Calamari
Raw oysters
Shrimp mild with hot and juicy sauce
Shrimp mild with garlic butter
Lobster with garlic butter
Crawfish medium hot and spicy
Fried Catfish
Sweet potatoe fries

Everything was incredible. Oysters were good but nothing special. Wish I didn't order rice as that's what put me over the top but couldn't help it I'm Chinese and the sauce over rice is oh so good!

Import beers for $3 - Domestic $2. Just Beer - no wine or alcohol.  Wish they had at least wine as not so filling as beer.

"Went around 10pm on the weekend with a group of 8.  The service was actually great.  The staff seated us on the outdoor lounge as quickly as they could, and went out of their way to gather and arrange furniture to accommodate our group.  Not the typical 'we are too cool for life itself, and could care less if you are paying to come here' attitude we'd come to expect from staff at some of the other trendy bars.

Setting was great - awesome view of the strip at night from the patio; you could talk or dance, depending on your group.  Better view and setting than Tao Beach or a much more expensive club, and much better atmosphere.

No cover, at least when we were there.  Boutique cocktails made with fresh ingredients - I got a pineapple chipotle margarita - which was decent but the splash of actual tabasco sounded more innovative than it actually tasted.  Reasonable at around $12.  I'd recommend trying one of their specialties.

Not a very large selection of cigars like we'd expected, but they did have them available, and it was nice to smoke them outdoors.  DJ playing club music from his computer and got some bachelorettes dancing - it would probably be a good place to go with a group like that for the lounge atmosphere without having to buy table service.",4.0
"I was really excited to try this buffet because I always saw those ads and billboards around Vegas saying it's one of the best, but it really wasn't. I paid $24 for the buffet, but I didn't like anything in particular. It was all about the quantity and not the quality. I would much rather spend more money to eat at the Mirage, Wynn, or Bellagio buffet. The line took FOREVER because instead of cashiers, they had these stupid machines you pay at. It's like those self checkout lines at the grocery store but so many people don't know what the fuck they're doing so it's actually way less efficient. I think my favorite thing here was the vanilla yogurt gelato and I really don' t know how much that says about the food.",3.0

"This used to be our birthday tradition. The first time that my husband and I came here together (I'd been coming for a few years prior.), we were here for a while. It's not that my husband hadn't had sushi before I came along, only that I actually broadened his food horizons. In addition to sushi (this is ok), there is a custom cooking section (good, but there is a slight wait time), hot foods like tempura (try the yams), stuffed shrimp (good), and teriyaki chicken (kind of fatty), a cold salad section like seaweed salad ( I love this salad) and a handful of others, the crab legs (better than most casino buffets- really favorful- we like to get a full plate of this) and full dessert section with ice cream, cheesecake bites, carrot cake bites, cookies, and candies (seriously you will want to try some of these delicious sweet things). Since there is a huge selection, it is hard not to find something for everyone.  

Since I don't want to be sick and get rolled out of the restaurant, I pace myself. I only get what I really want and I save room for dessert- ice cream, of course! My rule is two plates of food. I want to be satisfied but I don't want to overdo it. I use the rule of moderation. 

The service is excellent. The staff is very attentive and eager to please; filling drinks and taking the dirty dishes away. It's nice that there is a bathroom in the restaurant. There are numerous tvs all around and there is music playing (but you can't hear it if the place is pretty crowded).  Also, don't forget about the crab- it's really good. (We went to the one in Hawaii but were disappointed that it wasn't really all you can eat- there was a person handing out two pieces of crab legs.) In the beginning I wrote that this used to be our birthday tradtion- the birthday promotion used to be BOGO, but now, the promotion is BOGO, if there are six people in your party. In the AAA coupon book (AAA customers- you get this at the customer service desk, upon entering the center via the parking garage), there is a 10% off coupon and I believe that there is an ongoing Locals promotion, of 10% off.

In a world of mediocre casino buffets (Las Vegas, lets be honest), this is still better than many of the ones available (not worth the time or money). All things considered, it's also in a good location, the Miracle Mile Shops in the Planet Hollywood Casino.",3.0

It was a little pricey but we ordered just about everything on the menu since there were several of us that were hungry after a day out and no one was interested in dining out.  The portions were good size and we could have shared.

"Generally speaking, food described as ""like mom's cooking"" tends to be made with love, but not so much flavor- gotta make sure it's not too spicy for your sister, not too salty for your dad, and take into account everyone else's flavor preferences and dietary restrictions, too. This spot has a great variety of enchilada sauces, friendly family service, and a huge dining room to bring your whole crew. Note their Wednesday AYCE special.

Ordered a combo plate to go- one red beef enchilada, one green chicken enchilada, and a beef taco, plus a side of guac. Food was good, but as others have said, the amount of meat in the enchiladas is minimal. Plate overall was a good sized portion, and I liked the red sauce more than the green. I do wish they offered a Tex-Mex version with shredded yellow cheese instead of exclusively using the crumbled white cotija. Guac was fresh with tomato and onion, definitely get an order to share. 

I called ahead after reading other reviews that said wait times could be lengthy- my food was being brought out right as I walked in, 15 minutes later. I would consider coming back if in the area and specifically craving enchiladas, and try other sauces. However, I think they need to step it up a little to stand out in a neighborhood packed with Mexican restaurants.",3.0

I think there are better AYCE places in the area. Go to Sakana instead.",3.0
"Lots and lots of selection for AYCE! Dinner was $24 which is a couple bucks cheaper than most AYCE sushi places in Vegas. 

I really enjoyed the sides at Yama Sushi! Loved the tempura, BBQ ribs, agedashi tofu and gyoza. The nigiri sushi was fresh and delicious. Rolls were yummy as well - be careful though since some of them are really heavy and can fill you up quite a bit! My favorite roll was sun of a beach. 

Yama gets really busy so be prepared for a long wait. I came on a Friday night and waited a hour during prime dining hours. The service is fairly quick when you do get seated though!",4.0
"Hmmm. Almost 300 reviews on this place and the reviews seem to be fairly consistent 4 and 5 star reviews. Which leads me to believe that either I ate here on an 'off' night, or else there are alot of people out there who have never eaten really good sushi.

This is apparently a local spot. Located only 5 minutes from the The Strip, but in a nondescript strip mall that you would never think to look in, unless you were coming here. Must have waited for a good 20 minutes to get in the door; there was a long line of people at 8pm on a Friday night.

Very low-key, casual environment. No interior design to speak of. You are coming here for the prices. They have a $23 all-you-can-eat dinner special that some friends recommended, so we went with it.

In terms of selection, Yama Sushi has that in abundance. At least 25 specialty rolls, and then all of your typical rolls and sushi, etc.

My issue with this place isn't that it's actually bad - it's not. It's just not particularly good either. The rice was soggy and sticky. The fish portions are really tiny. And the taste of the fish gets easily drowned out by the soggy, sticky rice. The edamame was actually bad. Miso soup was blah. And honestly, $23/each comes out to over $50/couple which, I've been to  many mid-range sushi places with comparable prices that offered better food, if not the selection that Yama Sushi offers.

The service was also sub-par. Many items were ordered that never came out of the kitchen. Had to request a tea refill four times before the refill came. When we were wrapping up our meal, the server essentially made it clear that it was now time for us to leave.

For my money, I would find somewhere else. And you can trust me; I'm an Elite. ;)",3.0

The service was great especially Doug the bar render, he was very nice and knowledgable of the menu.

"Came here on a Friday night with friends to see Tom Cotter and 2 other comedians. It was a terrific venue and we definitely had plenty of laughs. Most of the venue is booth seating, but they have several tables in the front and back. We were seating at a table towards the front, but luckily there were people in front of us, so we didn't get picked on. You have to order 2 items from the menu. Many comedy clubs are like this, so that wasn't much of a surprise. I ordered the Margherita pizza which was okay, nothing special. Also had a sprite for my second item. The comedy club is located in the heart of East 4th street, so you can't miss it. The booths seemed pretty comfortable, so I probably wouldn't pay for a table if I were to go back.",4.0

"We found this place on a different website. Urbanspoon. It was listed as new and reviewed very well.
Came here for lunch with Hubbie and the fabulous Shirley Martin. Shirley had chicken tacos with rice and beans, and said it was good, more food the she could eat. Garry had chick a chick a boom boom. He said it was delicious, spicey and made his nose run. I had the light combo. Just right. ( no rice and beans)
Ashton was our waiter and he made us feel very welcome, he was attentive, but not pushy. He clerked on our food and offered us dessert, carefully describing some wonderful selections.
You should give them a try.",5.0
"Decisions, decisions. Does my review belong here or under Tapino Kitchen and Wine Bar? Either way, it's the same address. Since I drank 1 glass of wine at the bar area, near the entrance in the outside patio lounge, I'm writing my review here. 

HOW DO YOU FIND TAPINO? Seems like an easy thing, no? Well, when you're not familiar with this part of Scottsdale and you have scant details to go by - like ""it's at the corner of Shea/Scottsdale"" - you can easily miss Tapino, no matter how large the font on the outside of the building is, because, to be honest, you can't see the building from the street. So, take a turn onto 70th St off Shea and turn into the plaza there. It's in the same area as Sushi on Shea. Once you know this, you should have an easier time finding the place. (Let's hope.)

The decor is very modern. The high bar chairs we sat on had velvet blue cushions. Very swanky. The music is very down tempo. I really liked the atmosphere. You really can do no wrong in my book, when you use bottles of wine as a focal point in design. I love looking around and seeing bottles on display. 

Word to the wise: The inside was like a meat locker, though. Super chilly inside around 5:00 p.m. on a Sunday. I didn't think that was necessary. So, bring a light sweater or jacket!

Bathrooms are clean, too, although they seem to take on a more ""down trodden"" appeal, in direct constrast with the lounge style. But, hey, it's just a bathroom, right? Atleast they had a bowl of mints on the sink!

At any case, my friend and I were the only two in the bar area (and maybe the entire restaurant? Tapino looked dead.) So, we got top-notch service. Our waiter was a sarcastic guy, but that's okay. I was having trouble spitting out my words anyhow. I went with their $5 glass of Viognier (The White Knight from Clakrburg, CA). Our server was sure to check back in with us, ""How is it? Is it different than the one you had yesterday?"" Yes, it was. And considering my first-ever experience with a Viognier was at the Tempe Arts Festival from a winery in Sedona, I'd have to say I'm liking this wine!

Uhm, if you've never had a Viognier, I INSIST you try it. Yes, it's white. But it tastes unlike any white you may had before. Definitely not fruity like a grigio or riesling. And it's not oaky like a chard can be. It isn't had to swill like a savignon blanc (ick), either. It has a very distinct taste - very smooth with more character than you might anticipate. My friend seconded this when she sampled it. 

She went with a red from Italy. Not sure exactly what it consisted of, but when prompted, our server was eager to rattle off the delicacies of this wine. I sampled it and it was very smooth. 

The 5$ wine list is a great draw to Tapino. You can try wines from France, Italy, Germany, Cali... It's great! And they  do have a little menu to choose from, but we refrained from noshing. 

All in all, a SUPER place to go IF you're in the area and want to stop for a glass of wine. I'd recommend it for that reason alone. As a stand-alone destination, well... if I lived in the area, sure. I'd love to go here when I have a hankering for vino, especially the Viognier. But I won't make a special trip out to Tapino, unless, of course, I realize I can't find The White Knight (or any other) Viognier elsewhere.",3.0

Although, the slice of cheesecake I had, seemed smaller, then what they served at the one at Caesars Palace. Then again, its been about a year since I ate at that one, so things might have changed, and they are cutting down the portions.",4.0
"BEWARE OF FAKE STARS
Second time ordering to give them another chance. NO LUCK!
I ordered a Hawaiian Calzone, large pizza 5 toppings, med pizza 3 toppings and a side of meatballs. The Calzone has SOOOO SOGGY (a 1/4 cup of juice I retained from it, saved it too, cause I was going to march right back up there to show the manager)  I did not, instead I called, he was quite ""matter of fact"" in his defense of this shabby meal I paid over $54 for!
 I said I only tried this place BECAUSE OF THE GOOD YELP REVIEWS. And with this meal, I would have to be honest and write a bad one. HE DID NOT CARE WHAT SO EVER!!!! His exact words were ""GO AHEAD""
 After a back and forth argument he did say he would give me A  free pizza or make it right the next time I come in. BIG DEAL after  paying for delivery, and trying to convey my CLEARLY poor meal to him over the phone, (i even offered to text or e-mail pictures of this slop I had of a meal on my table, not interested)
I do NOT want any of your FREE FOOD! I just want to maybe help someone else from wasting their money! I guess if I owned a business I would ask all my friends to write five star reviews also.",1.0

I also has a tasty coconut cake thing half dipped in chocolate. Tasty.

I love the decor and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.

I ordered chicken tacos and it was by far the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. It tasted like chicken boiled in water with a sprinkle of cheese on top. Nothing else. Sure they gave little cups of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole but it didn't help it taste any better. It's like they forgot to season it or something. I only took a few bites and gave up. When you spend $80 for two entrees and drinks you expect some edible food.

We also shared a Frito misto, which is really good except they're pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  The pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and they're quite good.

"This is definitely one of the largest beading and jewelry making supply stores out here in the valley. The selection is pretty large. The layout has the majority of their products easily seen and easily available. They do have some tables that are full of bins you will have to rummage through to find pieces you want. The back wall is also set up this way with different findings. I come here fairly often when I need some supplies. Their prices are fair, and they are often running sales of 40-50% off their merchandise. They do ask that you leave large purses and bags in lockers, to avoid issues of theft. Since I know this I only go with my purse itself this way I can just tuck it under my arm, since I don't like the idea of leaving my actual bag in a locker. 

As mentioned above, the prices are fair for what you find. They carry everything from the inexpensive to semi-precious and precious stones. Those, of course, are pricey.",4.0

If you do your research, you'll see that YouFit signed an  Assurance of Voluntary Compliance with the Florida Attorney General's office (that's where their corporate office is located) and paid a $65K fine because they demanding $10 cancellation fees...   Maybe a letter to Florida's AG is in order?  Maybe Arizona's AG also needs to look into them as well.

But it's funny that carnivores don't take in meats tasting like vegetables, but the vegans take in foodstuffs tasting like meat. Hmmm....

Squirrel!

Anyways, I was in the vicinity of some green unhealthy new americans and decided to finally try Green restaurant. It's popularity proceeds it and after reading the menu online, there were a couple of dishes I wanted to try.

Mainly the Dagobah. Day-go-wha? Yeah, Dagobah. Actually the full name is Dagobah Jungle ($8.75): jerk spiced fried brussels sprouts over fresh greens tossed in jamaican jungle dressing with carrots and crunchy tortilla strips. That's how I ordered it but the cashier also gave the choice of having it in a burrito. 

Daay-oh. Day-ay-ay-oh! Dagobah come and me want to eat it all. It arrived to the table in a large bowl with ample brussels and a decent portion of salad. On first taste of the dressing (I think it was tahini based) the sky must have parted and heavenly light shined down on me. It was delicious and made me forget about the jerk seasoning which was completely AWOL. Too bad, because now that I think about it, spiciness in this dish would have probably sent me UP to heaven. 

I also tried the samosas ($6.75): curried potatoes, peas, carrots and fresh garlic wrapped in a thin fried pastry with tamarind dipping sauce, says the menu. Well...four small samosas came on the plate in thick crispy fried dough with - maybe - two cubes of potatoes in each one. Curry? Couldn't taste it. Garlic? Couldn't taste it. Carrots and peas? I'm pretty sure I would have been able to spot them -- if they were there. But they weren't. Did I already say AWOL? i would not order these again. 

Oh yeah, I also had the animal fries ($5.75) which are supposed to be potatoes seasoned with thyme and smothered with melted cheese, grilled onions, and 1k island sauce. These were really good, but thyme was not on my side? It was AWOL.

Are you seeing a pattern here?

So, overall, even with all the absent flavors, the dishes were good. Nothing was too oily or over done. Portions were generous, much better than I'm used too. I would like to return and try the Karma Curry, 

If I could change only one thing, it would be the onions on the animal fries. Onions flavor was weak and they were chopped very small, almost insignificant. If it wasn't for the sauce I would not have liked them as much.",3.0

"okay the two stars are based on 3 series of visits to this new addition to the chemus mc caffreys family. the owners of the downtown irish pub have created this grown up, mature but very stylish irish pub just up the way from the other place, and one things for sure! they have the same standards when it comes to service.......non existent, scarce and brain dead. i've tried the pub area (tall comfortable chairs by bar), the lounge area (short chairs away from bar) and last we ate at the bar. the first two times i was in a rush and stated this before hand, we were trying to catch a play during fringe festival, and of course it took her 5 minutes to bring the bill after it was requested, but of course she was standing at the computer flirting with the other server. that day my burger was alright, but the lettuce and tomato served with it looked like left overs from the night before. the corn beef and cabbage was cut like proscuitto, not good very dry, served without butter, and very fatty. however, i gave them another chance a few days later when we return to see another few plays, and this time the service (from same girl-one i over tipped to avoid this lack 'o service-much to my dissmay the big tip meant squat) was horrible. we were one of 3 tables in the place too, however the chef salad and ranch dressing were delicious! the veggies, all but the tomato were fresh! so being that i fell in love with the ranch (so hard to find a good one!) we returned tuesday for lunch, and low and behold the same salad i ordered the other day around supper time was the same price, but half the size!!! what the FFFF????? bad service and cheating the lunch folf without a small discount for smaller portions? not right. the bar service was the same but luckily we weren't in a hurry. however i asked for the bill, it was brought and then the bartender went to take up shop at the server station to talk with the other servers. i litteraly heelyed (i was wearing my heelys -shoes with wheels) over there and took her my check and credit card. im amazed, but i will give them another try, the ranch is deo. don't go to the turf if your picky on service, heck or even if you just want it, they wont give it to you and you'll hate this place. but if your easy going and want to waste time in the AC go there, you will get lots of free air! oh yeah btw the waffle fries are deo too!",2.0
"My dress was amazing everyone loved it, and I got it for a good price, that being said.....the bridal shop on the other hand was the main cause of stress, and being a bride you already have enough on your plate without having to worry about people doing their job. From the moment I walked in I knew I should not picked this bridal shop, we were ignored for a bit even though we had an appointment, granted it was a weekend of a trunk show so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, the dress collection they have is amazing, Tammy , the owner, has amazing taste, the only time we got real attention was when the store died out, after I paid in full for my dress more issues occurred, first it was the veil, I called several times to get the status on it and I got the run around, no one ever called me back like the said and I got several different answers, I only got a real answer when I actually talked to Tammy apparently there was a mix up with the veil but no one bothered to communicate that with me the 5 times I called it took over 4 months to get my veil, then the dress, I was assured I would have plenty of time before the wedding to have it in and altered , the dress came about a month before the wedding, it took about 3 weeks for alterations, after the fitting the dress still didn't fit right, after fixing it I got the dress 10 days before the wedding which was cutting it close in my book, my main issue with this shop is lack of communication and rudeness of the employees, when I went in for my first fitting after the dress came in, my maid of honor could not find a sitter in time, so she had no choice to bring her 3 month baby, even though he slept the whole time and didn't make a sound we were given the dirtiest looks by the lady working there, she was extremely rude about the whole situation.

"I love this bar! 

Chris, Renee and Rory are all competent, attentive and welcoming bartenders. Fresh drinks are easy to get, and once you establish what you drink, you'll rarely have to ask; finish one, another appears. Ashtrays are emptied as quickly as a butt is crushed into them.

The Ellis Island (their parent organization) beers are all eminently drinkable, from the IPA to the Light with all the relevant stops in between represented. You aren't going to find a bunch of boutique nonsense on tap here, so if that's your gig, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you like beer for beer's sake, you owe it to yourself to give their taps a whirl. Plus, it's made here, and has been since WAY before it was commonplace.

And then there's the Egg Nog. It is a revelation, and an amazing way to warm up on a chilly Winter night. Creamy, smooth and it packs enough of a kick that you'll be crooning like Bing Crosby in no time! Stop in for a glass and TAKE A BOTTLE HOME, the revelers at your holiday parties will thank you.

As others have mentioned, the food is solid across the board. The Chicken Pot Pie (easily serves two) and the French Onion Soup are go-to choices, and the recent addition of Soft Pretzels with a delicious beer/cheese sauce is a no-brainier when catching up with friends over drinks.

"Happy 10th anniversary! We have come here since the beginning and remain loyal customers even today. This is an amazingly clean, friendly and calming place to go. The employees are young and very long term and always remember names and faces, making us feel welcome and valued. This is an exceptionally clean and one could actually eat off the floor. The types of services offered are suitable for beginners or hard core tanners. There should be a sincere amount of  congratulations as to how the owner, Rhonda, manages to remain so successful after so many years! Give this a try and I think you will agree. Top notch and good customer service keep us coming back, time and time again! Here is to the next ten years of tanning at  Radiance!

"Great atmosphere, a very nice sushi bar, and the bartender had some nice tatts.
The sushi, fresh and well prepared.
There's a nice view of the street from the open air sushi bar.
The servings were generous as well.
The music was also humming at precisely the right enjoyable volume.
Definitely a must do destination if you're looking for sushi downtown.
A plus rating.",4.0
My boyfriend and I have been looking for good pizza since he started visiting me here in Vegas. We decided to try this place since they were close and open at 12:30 am. I read the reviews and decided to try them anyways. We walk in and a guy hands us a menu and tells us to meet him at the register when we are ready to order. We walk thru the door to the dining area and another guy comes behind the counter and asked us if we were ready to order. We finally (because I'm always slow lol) decide on a large sausage and pepperoni and a small meatball boli. The guy hands us a receipt and we go pay. After about a 15-20 minute wait our food is ready. We get back to my house and almost break down the door (it smelled that good!!!!!). The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because there was not enough sauce on the pizza for me and we didn't know you had to pay for marinera sauce for the boli. They were both great (even the next day) but sauce would've put it over the top!!!!!! I wish they would partner with Eat24. I'd order from them as often as I could!!!!,4.0
"Don't do it!  I was with some friends who wanted to try this place last Saturday around 2pm, they waited nearly 1/2 hour for a table and when we were seated I noticed only 50 percent of the tables were occupied.  I thought this was strange until we waited another 15 minutes to get our drink order taken.  Finally we ordered and the food took a while to come to the table.  However it came in reverse order.  The entrees were served first, then when we asked about the soups and salads, the waitress said they were still cooking them.  Funny, I wrongly assumed there would be a pot of soup in back.  It never occurred to me that the soup would be cooked by the bowl.  LAME!  If your going to bark out your behind at someone, do it to someone who has never worked in a restaurant.  All the while 4 other tables took their turns yelling at the servers and management for the horrible service.  One lady threw her drink on the table and ran out, she was at the end of her rope.  Or just liked drama.  We paid and left a 0 tip, which pains me because I believe that the server was put in the wrong job.  She should have been in the kitchen, or cashier or something.  She was not waitress material.  I would only recommend this place to people who like to yell, because that is the only way you will get your food.",1.0

Was here 12/8/11 boyfriend had the meatloaf I was jealous I didn't order the same thing it was very well seasoned &moist the mash potatoes were cheesy goodness he said the veggies were tasty too the meatloaf is good! I had the chicken sandwich it wasn't seasoned that well type bland it was a large portion. My boyfriend also said the bartender made a good tasting long island ice tea the food also had a cute presentation and was well priced for so much food thumbs up hash house was the best food we had in Vegas and we ate at the cosmopolitan & bellagio,4.0
"Get the sage fried chicken Benedict! One of the best breakfasts I've ever had and definitely #1 in breakfast in Vegas! Portion size is outrageous here! Expect left overs to take back to the room! Go get a coffee at the bar to help pass the time and keep calm for the long wait ahead! LONG wait, but worth the wait! Priced well.",5.0
"This is my second time visiting Hash Hash A Go Go. The food is excellent. Very flavorful and well worth the wait. I had a Bloody Mary (YUM!) while we waited for our table. Once we were seated, my husband and I decided to split the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portions are huge, so splitting a dish makes sense. Prices are reasonable and overall, the staff was friendly. We will definitely keep coming back.",5.0
"This place is by far the best deal in Vegas. It is located on the strip amongst all the other place that are convenient to your hotel but you'd never know it based on the service, prices and quality. The servers are friendly, personable and informative. Our bartender/waiter gave tons of great suggestions for our trip.  The prices are the most reasonable in town and the portions are huge! The food is equally high quality. The eggs Benedict that I ordered for I think $13 kept me satisfied all day. The chicken and bacon stuffed waffles, $17-$18 I think, was enough for 2-3 people. And it was as good as it sounds.

If you're on a budget but still want to eat somewhere fun with ""Vegas flare"", this is the spot! Open 24/7 and centrally located on the strip.",5.0

"One of my favourite dim sum restaurants in the city. I only come here for what I can ""Chinese brunch"". 

Their dim sum is a tad pricier than other locations in Chinatown but it's offered all day (literally). I've been here after midnight on many drunken occasions stuffing my face with dumplings.

There's usually a small lineup at the front door but the restaurant has a back room so don't be discourage if you see a line. I'm usually seated in under 10 minutes.

Would highly recommend especially if you're looking for a step up from your standard after hours pizza.",4.0
"Really good dim sum that is available all day. No carts - you order off a menu. Numerous options on the menu. We ordered the seafood lo mein from their regular menu and it as a watery slop though, so if we go back, we'd stick to the dim sum menu only. Fast and efficient service. Hole in the wall setting.",4.0
"So it was my first time doing Microderm abrasion here. they took me  exactly my appointment time which was wonderful! however I'm not especially glad that I had to pay $150 for a Microderm abrasion that lasted 15 minutes. I've done other micro dermabrasion's that have been 30 to 45 minutes long I felt like I got ripped off. I don't know about anybody else but I know when I'm getting things like this done I want to close my eyes and relax. unfortunately I wasn't able to because the girl that was doing it kept talking to me and not just asking me about how my day was trying to upsell me on other things that they do there and coming up with all of theses Things that are wrong with my face that I should be using their services for.  I figured they were somewhat pushy because on the day I made the appointment for my session the woman was trying to get me to buy a six pack when I haven't even tried their services yet. Then after I left my session the receptionist tried to push me on buying a package for something else which was very expensive and when I told her I would think about it she then told me she would give me the Father's Day sale which was 10% off.. (by the way I'm not a father and I'm a woman ) Personally I find that they try to hard to sell, their extremely pushy and for the amount of money that you do pay you don't get your services worth. 
Don't be like me and feel stupid after you leave there...my 45 minute ride home all I did was think about how stupid I was that I spent $150 on a 15 minute session",2.0

Best sushi flavor For the price I've ever had delicious!  OK it is a limited menu but everything tastes amazing my favorite was the salmon roses.  The whitefish tuna and the eel was mad so well and the hand rolls weren't stuffed full of rice to make you full.  Everything I had was above average.  And the price is crazy under $14 CAN this place could easily be $30 US in California.  The place was amazing I just wish we had one by us.,5.0
"This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Took the family my wife had the combo with a cheese enchilada and a cheese tamal.  The red sauce is nothing but pure chili powder watered down.. Terrible. 
 I had the Carnitas Uruapan. Should have asked for a plate of pork jerky because that is what it was.. 
  My son was the only smart one that did not order anything.

   To top off the night I ordered two of the $3.00 draft beers and was charged $7.98..",1.0
"This restaurant does NOT deserve the 4 Star Rating it has on Yelp...a 5 Star Rating is much more fitting.  Let's break it down:  a perfect cozy location off of Ellsworth, it's BYOB - which is always a bonus, an eclectic & intimate setting (get there early and request window seating), an attentive wait staff that is warm and welcoming...and I haven't EVEN gotten to the meal itself yet!  
My husband and I took our 6 year old daughter there and we all had an amazing experience and delicious meal.  My husband's lamb burger melted in his mouth, my lamb chops were tender (medium rare) and juicy with just enough spices, my daughters spinach and cheese ravioli was so yummy she was practically licking her plate (insert appropriate level of parenting/manners ;~)

"2 stars is the a fair rating I can give. The first star is the ambiance-it is a romantic place for a date. There was a live guitarist playing songs ranging from spanish music to love story by Taylor Swift. The 2nd star goes to the waiter who was with us (don't know his name but he was an older kind gentleman). He was very courteous and accommodating. 

Food: I ate during summerlicious and the food was not up to par compared to other establishments in terms of taste. Three of us ordered lobster. the luckiest person had a portion of lobster with generous sides, while me and another friend had a really small serving. 

Interfering, rude staff: When reserving our table we indicated that we preferred to pay separate bills. On explaining this to our waiter, another waiter overheard our conversation and stepped in and told us flat out 'No'. He said it wasn't the establishments policy to accommodate the option of paying separately unless we indicated it in the beginning of the reservation. He than turned to one of my friends who chuckled and informed him that this wasn't a laughing matter and it was very serious. The way he spoke to us was rude, as though we did something something bad. In the end our original waiter came back and we settled the one bill but split into different payments.

Maybe it was one of those nights where things got screwed up and maybe the rude waiter had a bad day; however, I still expect professionalism coming from the staff and also uniformity when it comes to the food.",2.0

It's a phone case!! They sell this same case at every sprint store, so now I have to drive all the way across town to go to the original store I bought it from? Since when does that matter?

"This was definitely one of the highlights of my last trip to Vegas. The tickets are on the pricey side at $20 per person and the aquarium is on the small side, but the animals are fun to behold and the design of the shark reef is very creative and impressive. There are small reptiles, snakes, rays that can be petted, piranhas, and other fish and animals. The shark reef is very cleverly designed by simulating the feel of an abandoned ship at the bottom of the ocean floor. Lastly, this is a good place for picture-happy people.",4.0

"I love Baskin Robbins. I've never bought a whole cake in this place, but I tasted one of theirs at a party, and it was great. It had a tiny bit of freezer burn, but perhaps it was the host's fault. She bought the cake a month in advance.
I go inside and order sugar cones and sundaes. Occasionally I get a banana split (but don't tell my wife), 
I've never been disappointed. I get frustrated when a person, who is in front of me, wants to sample five ice creams, but what can I do...
Oh...I almost forgot. I've had a couple of milk shakes (strawberry), and they;re good, too.
They always have a wide variety of flavors. My wife gets one kind, and I get different one, and we share (awww). 
The service is fast. It's almost as if they drop everything to get my order up quickly.

"Ooo~Ooo - pick me - i want to be review # 100 - that's a nice rounded number, for a bar which rounded out my otherwise not-so-fabby night downtown.

Not being a frequent patron of the downtown environment, it was interesting to pound the pavement previous to a broadway show, scouting out for a chic wine or martini bar.  I wanted to find a place close to the Herberger Theatre - you know: since parking is the cost of a martini!   Also, since I luv my red wine, I needed a good wine-by-the-glass list, (whch, considering how many sports bars i passed on the way.... pickings seemed slim...) and hubby luvs the dirty tini, hence a wine/martini bar a looking we went.  Some healthy, non-fried snacks would be nice by now too :-)

I'm happy to report that this establishment fit the bill on all accounts.  The décor is sexy, sleek, and urban cool.  Everyone was dressed in office attire of suits, dresses or shirt & ties.  Sitting at the bar, it was good to see it only took a quick glance at the easily read menu to make a prompt decision.  The menu is great for making a fast and easy choice for a mixed drink, martini, white or red wine by the glass, and appetizers picks that were decipherable, (ie: nothing making you need to ask ""what the heck is this?"").

Our bartender was exceptionally efficient with serving, as well as understanding we were in for a quick nip, and needing to dash as soon as we enjoyed our drinks & a great little bar plate of pistachios, olives, salami, prosciutto, ciabatta and parmesan.  

Thanx for a good start to our evening, even though the show we saw sucked.... ah, well... c'est la vie - Not your fault Hanny's !",4.0

However, taro was not the only thing I got...there were so many flavors around the world!  That's what I enjoy most about yogurtland, they are dynamic.  The flavors evolved so that customers can always try new flavors.

We ended up with taro, passion fruit orange guava, Mexican Hot Chocolate, pistachio and of course, plain tart.  For some odd reason, I love plain tart.  So yummy with mochi on top.

Verdict: hot dogs were as plain as you can get, tasted just like a plain ol' Nathan's hot dog. I got the Vegas strip dog which had two hot dogs in one bun + mustard + ketchup + chili + cheese + guacamole + jalapeños. Basically they serve a plain hot dogs with various junk you can add on top. 

The fries were really good though. Perfect level of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.

My meal - Southern Fried Chicken & jalapeno grits - was inedible. I was told the chicken was double fried which probably explains why I thought I might chip a tooth trying to take a bite.

"This is my go- to spot  for breakfast on the weekends where my family/friends and I come to catch up from the week. 

I usually keep it traditional with the 3 eggs and some kind of protein on the side. However I have tried the pancakes and they are by far the most fluffiest pancakes I have had without being too heavy. 

With the non-stop refills of coffee and the generous portions I can't complain. 

It might not be high end but if you're looking for a greasy spoon where you can get the best bang for your buck then this hits the spot !

The only downfall is that I work outside the city, and I can't take advantage of their daily breakfast specials. 

P.S. I would like to comment on the on Angelique's comment. On the debit machine you are able to select an other amount for gratuity. I have never had a problem with the staff here. Considering they moved you upon your request when a table was available away from the door, I think is actually accommodating.

"Interesting menu. We didn't know about the patio, so we ate inside.  On our way out, we did see the patio -- perhaps we would have enjoyed that.

The menu has many choices, and everyone enjoyed their meal except for one of us (she didn't care for the sauce on her spaghetti).  My Margherita pizza was good, but I didn't realize that I needed to order the Bufala Margherita to get fresh mozzarella.  Oh well.

Definitely on the pricey side for lunch -- I was a bit surprised at the bill we racked up.  

Service was friendly and polite, but somewhat inattentive.  They weren't that busy, and it seemed like our water bottle was always empty.  Four people go through a small bottle pretty quickly.",4.0
"I visited recently with 4 adults and 4 kids over the Christmas holidays. I haven't eaten here since before kids so was excited about returning. We ordered the calamari starter which the kids loved so much we had to add another order. All the pastas and pizzas we ordered were as I remembered, quite tasty. The problem was the service. I'm never impressed when servers try to memorize orders for a large group. He had to come back to clarify one of the orders (not a good sign). Then after everyone was half way through the meal and I asked about my pizza which I never received, the server came back to say they burnt it and had to make me a new one!! Yeah right.. He totally missed my order for sure. Then when he finally brought my pizza he blamed the kitchen again for burning my order. After that, he was hard to get a hold of as he was busy serving another large group. Although I received my dinner after everyone else in my party was done, it would have been nice if he gave me a comp dessert or something. But no, just the bill with built in gratuity.

The food was commendable we had the special bruschetta with spicy strawberry jam/ricotta, an antipasto bruschetta and one with eggplant? and the special porchetta pizza topped with arugula. 

The only disappointment was the noise level. We were seated in the main dining room right after the entrance/bar. I thought we just caught the tail end of the  post-lunch​ work crowd (we dined around 130pm) but the rock music from the DJ located at the bar made diners speak excessively loud, we could here the diners beside us yelling at each other, we basically felt like we were at a pub on a Friday night. Not the type of restaurant to go to on a weekday lunch if you want to enjoy good Italian and be able to have decent conversation with the person in front of you. It may be more quiet on a weekend dinner, not sure. But other than that food, and service a plus.",3.0

"Nice, clean updated bowling alley despite the slightly rough neighborhood.

The bowling alleys nearby my house are dirty, outdated, overpriced, and filled with obnoxious teenagers.

I had a Groupon for Let It Roll and went with my husband and son. We only payed $10 for 2 hours of bowling with shoes for an extra person.

We were so pleasantly surprised when we walked in. Nothing fancy but clean and modern. I would rather have something simple and updated then gawdy neon lights and bad upholstery and carpet like my neighborhood bowling alleys.

The front desk employees were friendly and efficient. 

They had a great mix of music playing. Hits from every decade mixed with today's top hits. 

They have a mexican restaurant inside the bowling alley that actually looks quite tasty. A friendly waitress approached us at our lane asking if we wanted to order. We just ate our dinner so we declined but I definitely want to try the food next time.

As we were leaving they were starting their cosmic bowling with a DJ. We only heard a few songs but the DJ was AWESOME! I was impressed that a bowling alley DJ could be so good. It was practically like being at a club in the middle of Scottsdale. We want to go back with some friends for a fun adults night out.

My only complaint is that the bartender was a bit unfriendly. I understand that sometimes people are having a bad day or moment so I always try to kill them with kindness and most of the time they pull through. Not so in this case. My warm smiles, pleases, thank yous, and good tips did not cheer up this bartender. When I asked for some lemon wedges for our pitcher of Shock Top you would have thought I was asking her for one of her kidneys. But curiously enough, she was friendly with the interesting characters that were obviously regulars at the bar. Hmmmmm...

Overall we had a great time at Let It Roll. I love when I have a Groupon for a place or service and I end up loving it! They made a returning customer out of me.",4.0
"I was craving Thai food in Vegas and did not want to go anywhere that was serving overpriced, fusion, Thai food on the strip.  So I found Thai Food To Go on Grubhub.  It was a great decision.  The pad thai was good and authentic with the pickled radishes.  The red curry was delicious (I could drink the curry).  The pad see ew was good with Chinese broccoli (the right kind) instead of American broccoli.  And the cashew nut chicken was delicious.  Make sure to also get the Thai iced tea (I got the big one).  It is huge and definitely enough to share.  I'd order from this place again next time I'm craving Thai in Vegas!  Also, the delivery and service was very quick and pleasant.",4.0

So, if you are a minority and looking for comfortable place to hang out please call ahead and make sure she's not on duty! I'm not coming back until she's either quit or FIRED!

"You will not find a more clean bakery anywhere in the world.  Every time I am there, someone is wiping down windows or tables or the floors - it is always so clean, it's as if each day is their first day open.  The staff is incredibly pleasant, the atmosphere darling and the smell - very sweet and yummy.

Sadly, as a person with a chronic sweet tooth, I have never eaten anything at Sweet Tooth Fairy that I found to be delicious.  I have returned on several occasions (costing me an arm, a leg, a kidney and my first born) because my sister insists that it's ""so yummy"" but I have never been impressed.  I'm not a professional baker by any stretch of the imagination, but I prefer my cupcakes over theirs.  Maybe it's just me, though.  I do not really care for Georgetown Cupcake (D.C. Cupcakes) or Sprinkles, either.  :(",3.0
"OK...tried it and it was a solid OK.  Walk up to the counter to order, take a seat with a number card for your table and you get served.

Menu is straight forward and simple.  A number of offerings, all with options as to meat (steak or chicken), type of rice (brown or white) and style (the option chosen).  Very simple and there is a large menu board that you can peruse prior to the ordering station, so step aside if you are new to Pei Wei so the experienced hands can stream by you.

You can also order a beverage.  I ordered tea.  Got a hot cup and could only find the two containers of iced tea (sweet and unsweet) and an urn of hot water.  Ummm.  Other that rapidly moving servers there is no help available and being lunch time it was just a couple of chairs short of full.  I opted to put some iced tea into my hot cup and topped it off with hot water.

Portions are of two sizes: small and regular. I had the small and it was.  A measured scoop of rice and my main portion.  Should have ordered the regular which I spied at adjacent tables to be more generous.  If you are on a diet, go small.

This is an in and out place.  Order, sit, eat and go.  There are condiments, which, happily included hot mustard above the drink counter.  

Well run, very clean and tables were bused and reoccupied quickly.

The food was OK...sweet to my taste and lots of soy.",3.0
"I went in to labor on September 3rd with my daughter Lilly. I am a first time mom and was so scared of the labor ahead of me. I was greeted by the WORST nurse I have ever had in my life. I can't recall her name now but after the shift switch the assigned me the most AMAZING labor and delivery nurse any woman could ever have! She was attentive and gentle and so incredible. She was there every step of the way for me, explaining processes, holding my hand, encouraging me, and calming me during the scariest time of my life. For all other mothers out there I am sure you understand how incredibly important this was. At the end of my labor my doctor was running late and I panicked with fear that he was not going to make the delivery. Thank my lucky stars I had nurse Patty who is a veteran of child birthing and was able to successfully and confidently deliver my daughter because the doctor showed up about 10 minuets to late.

 The rooms after delivery are big and the rest of the nursing staff was nice including my personal nurses and the nursery nurses. The Anistesiologist that put in my epidural didn't give up on me even though it seemed like an almost impossible task to do due to my weird spine.  

But lets face it the real star of the whole process was Nurse Patty. Thank you nurse Patty for everything. You turly are a gurdian angel to me. Because of you, if I have any further children in the future  I will be going to P.V. Hospital hopefully on a night you are working.

"As I knew I would be trekking around Las Vegas nightlife in 5 inch heels, I Yelped foot massage places before our arrival and found this place.  After Thursday (night 1) of partying, my feet were already sore from my heels.   Friday afternoon at around 3pm, I called Pure Foot & Spa to see if I was able to make an appointment at 3:30pm for me and two friends.  They said 3:30 would be fine and be sure to come to Pure Foot & Spa as there are a lot of non-professional massage places along Spring Mountain Road.  

We took the taxi from Palazzo which cost roughly $13 (not including tipping the cab driver).  Upon walking into the establishment, we were given tea and seated in large leather where there was only one other customer getting massaged.  

AMBIANCE:  A clean, relaxing environment with about 9-10 leather seats placed in two rows accompanied by ottomans.  Blinds and curtains over the windows to dim the place a bit while relaxing music is on the speakers.

MASSAGE:  This is not only a foot massage.  They start off by having you sit on the ottoman with your feet soaked in a tea type of water and massaging your shoulders, neck, shoulders, and arms for a good 20 minutes or so.  They then have you sit back into the lounge chair where they continue massaging your feet and calves with lotion.  

PRICING:  A banner hanging outside advertises a 45 minute massage for $28.  We opted for the 60 minute massage for $38.  Additional services are available for an additional cost as we seen the other customer getting his calluses taken off and laying across two ottomans getting his back massaged lying face down.  Prices do not include gratuity.  There is a $1 fee if you pay by credit.

PARKING:  Pure Foot & Spa is located in a small plaza, so there is a lot available.  

Overall, my massage was heavenly!  He was able to work through some of the knots in my back (I have A LOT!) and provide me with looser muscles.  He did miracles to my feet because I was able to wear my 5 inch heels Friday and Saturday nights without waking up with sore feet the following morning.",5.0

"I don't know about you, but I'm a bit tired of just about ANYBODY being able to buy an L&L Hawaiian Barbecue franchise...then sending it to $h!+.  Seriously, a lot of you L&L owners are doing it WRONG.  If you're not Hawaiian or a resident from Hawaii, fine.  But dammit, some of you HAOLE (foreigner) owners are ruining the Hawaii restaurant's name!  Please, please, PLEASE learn about Hawaiian culture and Hawaiian ways!  Read a book.  Hire at least a Hawaii resident or two for good measure.  Why are just about NONE of the L&L Hawaiian Barbecues here in the mainland nothing like the ones back in Hawaii?  I'll tell you:

1) Food
2) Service

Simple but means so much.  I love how the owners of the original L&L Drive-Inn back in Honolulu came from humble beginnings to now being some of the richest people in all of Hawaii.  Hard work, perseverance, and the spirit of entrepreneurship paid off for them in spades.  For them they deserve great props.  But something just comes off as not inspiring when you branch out too much from your roots.  I wish there was more scrutiny when selecting new franchisees!  They can affect a brand name so much!  I get concerned because back in my island days of Maui I used to eat L&L quite a bit, it's like fast-food comfort for locals.  The food then was simple, uncomplicated, plentiful, affordable, and made with some form of integrity.  Most times you knew the cook, the cashier, the help staff.  Eating at L&L was one heck of a pleasure and a treat back home when I was younger.  Why?  Because livin' in Hawaii is HAHD.  Yes HAHD.  Most of us locals 'no can' eat out that often since food so expensive...restaurant dining was something you looked forward to.  

So I care a lot when places like this become a bit 'bastardized' and start to lose the love.  Where is the love?  Sorry Black Eyed Peas, it ain't here.  I hate to say it, but the recent incarnations of L&L Hawaiian Barbecue are lacking authenticity.  Lacking punch.  NO MO' LOVE!  I am happy but at the same time I am sad.  While the original owners surely get lots of kickback for each L&L franchise started, a little piece of my childhood dies inside.  It cries, then dies.  Then dies again for dramatic effect.  

We went here because this is the closest L&L by our house.  Tucked in a former diner, this L&L is just a façade of what lies inside.  A mess.

I'll start with the service.  Seems this L&L (like many of them) is owned by yet another Chinese family.  All of the employees that day were Chinese, which I mean no disrespect (I myself am 1/8 Chinese), but many of them were just not very welcoming.  Our cashier wasn't rude, but she wasn't exactly inviting either.  The cooks were hastily shouting out orders in Chinese, and food was constantly just being slopped into containers.  I suppose since it was busy all of us were being hurried along so our cashier could get orders in.  Not even a real ""Hello"" or ""Welcome to L&L"" when we entered.  Where is the local girl with the flower in her hair at the register that was always happy to see us when I was little?  Nani?  Lani?  Puanani?  No where in sight I'm afraid.  Like a candle in the wind goes my fond memories.

Even looking at the menu it's just not the same.  My nostalgia is kicking in but the prices for the food at L&L are kinda getting out of hand.  Really, like $8-$9 for a regular plate?  Even more if you like beef?  Whoa, brah!  Thought L&L was supposed to be a deal for families?  Expensive for what you get.

Next we'll go with the food.  I ended up getting my staple of a Chicken Katsu regular plate.  The wifey got the L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix with teri chicken, teri beef, and short ribs.  The kid got a cheeseburger and fries combo with a drink.  

Overall?  Really below average.  Thankfully the rice was Calrose and it was made decently.  The macaroni salad was CRAP, too much on the watery side and not enough flavor.  I added extra shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco to liven it up.  The entrees?  Not so great.  Chicken katsu looked golden brown on the outside but was pretty flavorless.  Would it kill you guys to season the chicken before you fry it?  The katsu sauce was thumbs down, another mixture of ketchup with who knows what.  This is why I often carry a bottle of decent katsu sauce (like Bulldog) if I know I want katsu.  Wife's BBQ Mix plate?  She didn't like it.  Too little food, and not flavored correctly.  What is up with the SUPER thin slices of beef, chicken, and short rib?  Small serving that left her hungry.  The kid's cheeseburger?  MEH, just a cheeseburger.  Not even a hand made patty like we used to have back at L&L (or just about any Mom & Pop eatery) in Hawaii.  Bun wasn't even toasted!  Fries were just plain crinkle cut.

I wasn't gonna even bother with authentic Hawaiian eats like a bowl of saimin or a Spam Musubi.

This L&L is just all kinds of depressing for me.  Mr. Kam & Mr. Flores, if you guys are still around please visit your stores and bring back the Aloha Spirit!",2.0
Joe's Doughs currently sells their donuts Saturday's at The Daily Press and takes special orders throughout the week. They don't have a brick and mortar location as of now. Their donuts are a yeast donut base (however I believe they are working on some cake donuts). They are currently priced at 2 dollars/donut. I have tried the raspberry vanilla and the chocolate coconut donut. Both were very good but the chocolate coconut cake was my favorite. These donuts are better than Krispy Kreme! Sooooo good!!!!

"I tried Body Solutions as a Groupon offer. My sister and I bought 6 treatments for 2 small areas for $99. That's a steal if you ask me!

I decided to treat my forearms and chin. I had never been to a laser place before and had never recieved laser hair removal. I was hesitant but willing to try something to remove virtually pain free and more permanent to remove this unwanted hair!!

For the first few treatments, I didn't see a lot of results but was reassured by staff that it could take up to 6 treatments. Around my 5th treatment, I noticed a huge difference on my arm hair growth and was very excited! After my last treatment, I didn't see a lot of difference with my chin but did with my arms. I rarely shave those areas anymore and am very pleased with the results.

you have to get the all you can eat for 22.95

it is a regular sushi bar menu, some things are limited to 1 order per person such as uni, oyster & sweet shrimp (which are all delish!!!!

the rolls are good, they are not ""all you can eat stingy"" if you know what i mean. they do not over load you with rice & skimp you on the fish.

i recommend the kaya roll

the appetizers are good, and so are the skewers.

"If you want some deliciously fresh Chinese food, come check out this place. They are having their grand opening going on right now, it's that new. My husband and I decided to try it out, and we were not disappointed! We were greeted right away upon entering and seated right away. Our waitress took our drink order and quickly returned with the drinks. She gave us time to review the menu. They have two options for sizes, Large which comes with white or fried rice, or the combo which includes an egg roll, fried wonton, 1 crab puff, fried rice and egg drop soup.
I opted for the Large garlic shrimp with white rice. My husband and I shared this as the Large is enough for two people. Be prepared to take a doggie bag home with you. The entree was delicious and arrived quickly. This dish is a bit spicy for my liking, but not overpowering spicy. The rice was cooked perfectly. They do take out, but not delivery.

The out back rusty area has awesome letters, industrial pieces, giant springs, and huge metal things, begging to be made into some sort of country-esque art piece.

"Every time I'm in Vegas, I always make it a point to visit the Bellagio fountains.  For some reason, it's just relaxing to watch the wonderfully choreographed  fountains dance and twirl in complete unison to the chosen song of the moment.  

Personally, I prefer to watch the fountains at night since there are also lighting effects, albeit tiny, used in the show.  Also, I believe after 8pm, the shows are every 15 minutes so you can enjoy this wonderful attraction all the more!

Bottom line:  A must see attraction for every Vegas traveler!",5.0

"My wife and I decided it was time to refresh the landscaping in our front yard and we wanted something different, something modern. After reading many reviews, we decided to give All Terrain Landscaping a call, and I am sure glad we did. The brother and sister team of Adam and Natalie are at the top of their game. Adam came out and asked us a few question and took some pictures of our house. Within a week I received an itemized quote for the job. My wife being a very visual person, ""what the heck is a gabion cage?!"", asked Natalie if we could see a rendering of her design. Within a few days Natalie was knocking on our door with her computer to show us her 3D design. All I can say is we loved it and didn't change a thing! We signed the contract on the spot. From this point forward the transformation of my front yard was like clockwork. Natalie, Adam and the whole crew always showed up on time and completed each phase on schedule. I would give them an A+ for their communication skills and accessibility. If I did have a question I usually got an answer back within minutes. The quality of their work was first class. By now you can tell I was very satisfied with the work All Terrain Landscaping did for me. I would highly recommend them to my friends and neighbors!",5.0

"Reserved Vinh as our wedding DJ two weeks before the wedding (recommendation by our wedding coordinator at Bali Golf Club). In those two weeks, Vinh was able to get a sense of our personalities and gave us the best party of our lives! To my surprise, Vinh stopped by our rehearsal to meet us. I am glad he did, because it was the perfect opportunity for him to touch base with my coordinator, photographer and myself. 

Vinh gets the crowd going! He is funny, goofy and personable! It is his mission to deliver on what you want from your DJ/MC. He is open to ideas. He even attempted to practice his non-existence Vietnamese for us (his idea)! He suggested an unique grand entrance as well! Got all our guests all hyped up! My guests did not leave the dance floor unless it was for a drink. Multiple guests could not stop raving on how our wedding was the most fun wedding they have ever been to! Thanks to my dream team!

Don't be that couple with the boring DJ that doesn't say a word and just plays the same playlist at every event! Vinh is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!",5.0
"I've heard soo many great things about beach hut deli so I just had to come in a try some of their subs. Came in with my boyfriend and first we thing noticed was the decor and ambiance, which was great. We were greeted once we came in and the place just looks awesome, plus there's outside seating! On their menu they have very fun names for the subs and it was so hard for me to decide since they all seemed really good. My bf got the ""big kahuna"" and I got the ""drakester"" after the worker highly suggested it to my indecisive self. We were both disappointed. Idk, they were both just missing the ""wow factor"" haha. Or maybe we just had super high expectations from the reviews. Nonetheless, fun spot with awesome happy hour deals and they even do some occasional celebrations with beer pong etc! Pretty awesome! Maybe we just need to try something else next time",3.0

Tonight,  they ""forgot to put my ticket up"". Really? Yet you managed to bring out half my order before realizing my ticket went missing?? There were 2 parties here before me, how hard is it to put up a ticket on such a slow night. So I have been waiting now for 48 minutes!

From what I remember.....   it was a very unexpected find in old town.  A very strange choice/location/interior but I loved it!  The drinks were so good, as I said, I many have enjoyed them a bit too much.  I really do remember that every one on the menu looked great and each one I ordered was amazing.

"We ordered the salt and pepper chicken which was pretty standard but it had a lot of little bones.  The beef noodles was alright as well.  Considering this place is supposed to be known for desserts, it wasn't very good.  We got the golden sago w/ sweet coconut noodles.  We were hoping that it would be like the place near us (Dessert Kitchen) and it wasn't.  The coconut noodles were... hard?  dried?  I don't know how to describe them.  They are cut wider than Dessert Kitchen's which would've been fine except for their texture.  They should be soft, yet chewy with that fun-in-your-mouth goodness.  These were not unfortunately and the soup was a thick, mango-y mess that coats your throat.  Definitely too sweet.
As for the bubble tea, I got the brown sugar milk tea, 1/2 sweet.  It was SUPER sweet.  I can't imagine what full sugar would taste like.  There was also very little tea flavour.

Perhaps some of the other menu items are better?  I'm not sure if I'll chance it.",2.0

Well, it is still awesome as it used to be and maybe more. Great and very clean rooms, good restaurants, good and not crowded bars, variety of shows, great customer service and clean and ample casino. The only star I am not giving to them is because the gentleman at the check in was really really slow, while other cashiers attended 2 or 3 people he just attended me; I would say it took him more than 30 minutes.

"A little secret hidden in the Hawaiian marketplace, Tamba was a surprising find and the quality was outstanding.

I was with a party of 5 and we all got something different and spent the evening swapping tastes of each others dishes. I myself had ""Palak Paneer"" and ""Yellow Rice"". The paneer was excellent and generous portions of tofu. The rice was nearly perfect but just a tad undercooked/dry but worked well as a mix with the paneer wrapped up in fresh nan.

The dishes and the restaurant are well presented with authentic palettes and decor. The music was subtle an unobtrusive and the waiter was superb.

While this restaurant is in Vegas, the prices were a little high than I'd normally expect but are a pretty good deal considering the location. Good deals can be had if you check the normal coupon books. There are specific ones for Tamba that could have saved us a bit.

With all that said, while the food was excellent, the staff was superb, and the atmosphere was inviting, the restrooms were atrocious. I was pretty shocked considering the dining experience to find the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a little.

Overall I still give Tamba 4/5, but please folks, take care of those frightening bathrooms and you'd easily be a 5.",4.0

Cost about $25 for a wristband to go on most rides , which include bumper cars, roller coasters, Ferris wheel, air hockey, etc. They have mini golf which I think was $6 each and that was fun.  You play mini golf while the roller coasters zoom over your head.  They have an arcade with old school games like Donkey Kong and Galaga and Ms Pacman.  There's also an area for carnival games to win cheesy gifts, like a stuffed animal.   For myself I'd give it 3 stars, but because it made my son really happy on the bumper cars, it gets 4 stars.",4.0

"After a different salon in the area decided they couldn't do my hair after siting me in the chair (and having all the information they needed when I set the appointment and they accepted the appointment). I left practically in tears because I really wanted to get my hair done today for a specific reason. I drove down the street trying to decide if I would just forget it and get lunch or try somewhere else. Well, I drove past La Capelli and took the chance by stopping in to see if they could take me. 

I totally lucked out! I explained myself quickly when I walked in and Amanda (the owner) said she could and would help me. It was total luck she could because she happened to have a no-show that freed her up at that moment. 

Not only did she take me in, but she knew exactly what to do to get my hair as close to what I wanted as possible without causing massive damage. See, I have very long raspberry colored hair and have had it this way for 5 yrs. My goal is to turn my hair white (on top) to match the roots that are growing in, and I fully expected it to be a silvery pink after the first processing since that's what it looks like when I get my roots bleached prior to adding more raspberry color. 

BUT, Amanda lifted most of the color out with a (safer) process than I knew existed and was then able to lighten my hair with very little pink/purple color tint. She couldn't get it safely to white on this one appointment, but I didn't expect her to be able to and still allow me to be long haired. :-)  It's definitely lighter than it was when I was a full time blonde many years ago. Got me way closer to my goal in one appointment then I expected anyone to be able to (and in the price range I expected to pay)!

I am incredibly impressed by Amanda's knowledge and entrepreneurship - especially considering her youth. Truly impressed!",5.0

I just had a horrible experience with a TWC Tech representative and a supposed Supervisor named Aaron or Erin. 

I had Digital Phone service installed on Thursday 3/5/15.  The techs (Clayton and Matt) that were over had trouble getting my wireless internet up and running.  After 3 hours here, with out success, I told them that I would have my work tech guy try to help me in the morning, and if he could not , I would call them back.  These guys were very nice and very conscientious. One of the Techs Clayton, thought of something on his way home that evening and called me to tell me they changed a setting from the office. Clayton didn't have to do that.  I feel it was above and beyond for him to do it after hours!   It worked!  I had wireless internet, but little did I know, that my wireless printing was still not working.  I found that out Friday night when we tried to print something.  I tinkered with it a little and still nothing.  I called TWC this morning and got a tech representative named Misty (I think).  She tried her best to try to help me, even downloading a HP manual and looking at some troubleshooting options.  She was very nice.  Unfortunately, I cut her off trying to switch phones.  When I called back, I got a gentleman (used loosely) that was no help at all.  He basically said my printer wasn't their problem.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.  After being on hold for several minutes, he came back and told me that a supervisor wouldn't be able to give me any more options than he would.  I told him I was very angry that he was ""road-blocking"" me from his supervisor, so he transferred me.  Aaron (Erin), the supervisor was no more help.  He basically told me to call HP if I had a printer problem.  I asked him it TWC would pay for the HP tech charges and he said no.  Then I said I wanted his service techs to come back out an fix everything back to the way it was (my wireless working) and he said he would but he would have to charge me for the service call.  I asked for his supervisor's name.  He gave me one.  We will see on Monday when I call if it was legit.   If I get no satisfaction from him, the next call I make will be to WOW to change my service.  Apparently, 19 years of loyalty to TWC means nothing except escalating fees, fewer services and HORRIBLE customer service.  All I want is for everything to be working the same as it did before they walked through my door the other day.  Is that too much to ask considering that's what they promised me?",1.0
"Really nice produce and specialty items entice you to spend your nest egg here and blow you college savings fund before Johnny is eligible to attend the state school.
This place is like Whole Foods, with a emphasis on local specialty items and some global foods. I saw some nice sakes, beers, and liquors from afar on the shelf. You could put together a gourmet meal here, no problem. Just bring your wallet and don't tell Johnny he is going to have to  work through college.  : )",4.0

"I have only been to this theater once.  I was hanging out with some girlfriends and this is the closest theater to where they live.  At first glance, it looks like a typical movie theater.  For the most part it is.  The thing that I found awesome, was that it has a daycare center.  If a couple wants to go to a movie and it's not appropriate for the child or they just want to do something for the two of them, they can bring their little one to the day care center.  I can't believe all the parents, who bring their kids to adult movies.  It's unacceptable and of course selfish of the parents.  I hope other theaters catch on to this.  

It's also right next to Buffalo Wild Wings and several shops and other restaurants in the area.  Check it out.",4.0

"Solid, tasty, friendly neighborhood Chinese food with off-menu Szechuan skills. Very reasonable prices make you want to order more than one dish per person. Will make brown rice for you if you call ahead 60mins before arrival.

Really impressed by the Szechuan Chicken (not on the menu) - perfect spice, complex flavor, and very good quality ingredients. Tastes like home-cooking, and the food is good-looking and colorful with fresh vegetables. Kung Pao Chicken (on the menu) is similar to the Szechuan, and is also made with generous slices of white meat chicken. We ate our food there, but from the looks of it, this would be really good take-out and would heat up well the next day. We ate our entire plates clean, really quickly. 

Looking forward to trying a lot of other stuff on the menu. Don't be fooled by the unassuming storefront, this place is as good as China One, if not better and definitely more authentic (and friendly goes a long way.)

Thanks to fellow Yelpers for their trailblazing on this shop. A small UYE would pack this joint, as there are only 4 or 5 tables (maybe 20ppl max?)...",5.0
"Some might give more stars just for having a busty super hot young blond waitress in a short tight dress.  I am all in favor of having young hot servers of any gender.  I know some of you don't believe me, but really, I don't.  However I don't like slow, unattentive service unless the place is really busy and the server apologizes and does their best.  I was a waitress once and know how it can be.  I am also not a fan of generic overpriced food.  This place reminds me of TGI Fridays or something.  Nothing special.  But I was starving, really starving and just couldn't walk any more and was ready to settle for anything so I did.  I got a veggie burger, beer and fries.  Mainly because they had sh*t for vegetarian options.  I prefer healthy food, usually but will eat crap on occasion.  They had a few salads I could have ordered but I wanted cooked green veggies.  Oh well.  The burger and fries were good.  Lots of beer on tap.  But we had to wait quite a while to order, had to ask twice for water (with 20 minutes in between each order because she didn't come back to our table for that long), and then we had to wait a long time for our check.  Being cute only gets you so far, I hope this girl has a backup career in mind.

Food is not cheap for what you get.  There are way better options around.  But if you like sports bars and generic American style pub food you might like this place.",2.0
"My girlfriend and I decided to spend our anniversary at a smaller scale restaurant. The day we went was also a miserable wintry day (our anniversary is early February) so decided to stay around her neighborhood on Bloor. Found this place online because it had winterlicious ($25 menu) and gave it a try.

WOW - great decision. Despite the snowstorm the place was pretty full. Which doesn't take long to happen as it is a relatively small restaurant. Decor is simple, nothing fancy, almost like your rural friendly French bistro somewhere in the Bordeaux area. We had a reservation (which helped) and got a small cozy table.

We both had the winterlicious menu with a half litre of pinot noir. I had the liver pate which was out of this world. Creamy and delicious that it warmed my heart on this stormy day. Continued with the steak frites - I would say arguably the best steak frites I ever had. The meat was nicely cooked on the outside and despite the thinness, managed to retain a nice red-pinkish inside for a medium-rare. Just salt and pepper, nothing else to ruin the delicious beef taste. Finished it with the profiterol, an amazing creation with a delicious sauce and a bit of ice-cream.

Loved the experience. Not a big restaurant, but extremely cozy, friendly and surrounded by wonderful people - other clients were nice families enjoying a meal like we were. Really loved it. Service was quick, courteous and prompt.

Despite the extensive food, only paid around $100 for both including the wine, tax and tip. The place may be slighly more expensive if you eat outside of winterlicious (or summerlicious) but the entire ambiance and the amazing quality of the food makes it perfectly worth it.",5.0
"I have to admit, this is probably one of my favorite boba shops in Vegas. Boba drinks are becoming extremely popular and that means a lot of places are serving low quality boba drinks. Mr. Z is the exception because they have really master the art of boba drinks.

AMAZON: The Amazon Drink is their specialty! If you go here and don't try it at least once, I'm judging you! The Amazon is passion fruit and kiwi blended with boba. I was a little hesitant myself when I heard the boba is blended, but adventurous me tried it and loved it. I can honestly not explain how satisfying it tastes to have your boba blended in the drink. Definitely my favorite drink here.

OTHER DRINKS: They also offer the basic boba drinks like teas, slushes, and milk teas. But what makes me love this place is their drinks are really fresh and unique. They have flavors that you can't find anywhere else like the Kumquat drink. They have really flavorful drinks like the kiwi slush. For milk teas, I highly recommend the honeydew milk tea. Their drinks are all super refreshing.

SETTING: The staff is super friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide which drink I want and they kindly explained their drinks to me. There is a zebra painted on the wall and their are zebra statues everywhere. So cute! They even had a zebra balloon when I was there. Their are high top seating, but it's pretty limited. The do have a small grass area in the restaurant which make a unique comfy area.",5.0

"Over 900 reviews? I was excited about trying this place.  When we walked in, I saw a few open tables but was told 15 mins wait... (It wasn't lunch or dinner time, i think it was around 3pm on Sunday).  After perhaps 5-7 mins wait, our table ""became"" available... but it seemed that particular table was available from the moment we walked in..  This place was very busy and slow service was expected.  When our server spilled a drink, she said ""that's why I brought extra napkins...""  

If you check in on yelp, it's $3.99 for chips and salsa.  Chips were thick and I wondered if these were homemade at this restaurant.

I ordered mimosa with cranberry juice. Never had one before and I thought I would try it. I think I prefer one with orange juice.  Now I know..

The burger I ordered was very big, I ate about 1/3 of it and couldn't eat anymore.  Very huge. Perhaps I wasn't that hungry, but I thought I had better burgers before.  Perhaps it was a bad day for me.",3.0

"There was a sewage blockage in our company which gave us so much grief for days. At first, we contacted another plumbing company to get this fixed, but the plumber kept rescheduling day after day until they never arrive at all.

Luckily, they did an outstanding job on such short notice. We had a technician who arrived on time, behaved very professionally, and answered all of our questions with confidence. He even explained what caused the blockage in the first place and recommended additional repairs with certain faulty pipes and drains.

We were able to get the sewage problem fixed in just a few hours, and we couldn't be more thankful to Express Rooter for their diligence!",5.0

"I don't know what the big deal is. This buffet is GOOD. Aside from a few low quality foods, the foods I got were great tasting. Since I'm a pasta fanatic, I got everything pasta along with oysters and dessert. The pesto was DELICIOUS and tasted like a quality Italian restaraunt dish (though not sure if you would deem it as 'authentic'). The Asian food was a little off, but hey, the other foods measured up. The oysters were also good and flavorful. Lastly, the dessert was simply great. I strongly recommend diners to try the caramel flan; it was so perfectly made! I applaud whoever made it. 

Two complaints that caused it a star:
- For the price, the presentation could've been way better. If not for the pharaoh decor it could've passed as a golden corral. 
- Servers would only pick up our plates, did not give us new utensils like most other buffets do. Even so, new utensils weren't provided so we had to reuse our utensils or flag down servers (which was not easy) 

If I hadn't done the timeshare and had to pay full price ($88 for my whole family) Another star probably would've been knocked off. Instead, I only had to pay $43 and for $43 this buffet is pretty nice. 2 thumbs up!",4.0

"If I could give this place negative stars I seriously would. This place is the absolute worst Asian/Chinese restaurant. I ordered the Pad Thai for take out. After viewing the menu I asked for no Shrimp. The menu also stated ""all dishes can be tailored to your taste"". This however was horrifically incorrect. I asked to have green onions and bean sprouts added. They said they didn't have any bean sprouts when I arrived however I was charged an extra dollar. The menu did not state that tofu was part of the dish. However the main ""protein"" in the Pad Thai was tofu. SMH

Basically their menu was very inaccurate. 

The women who assisted with the phone order and in the restaurant was extremely rude and had zero customer service skills. 

I have never in my life had to return a take out meal and this place forced me to. This was caused by the falsifying menu, appalling customer service and downright revolting food.",1.0
"They're directly across from giant office buildings from which large groups of lunchseekers emanate. Is ""lunchseekers"" a word? I guess it is now.

Anyway, our group of 10 was seated quickly, then not much happened. Then we got beverages. My friend got a glass of water all over his shirt. The server accidentally dropped it on him. The glass shattered on the floor. It was ok: accidents happen and it was a hot day anyway. The wet polo shirt provided a cooling effect. 

So, we waited a while longer. Too long, really. Food started coming out from the kitchen. The servers didn't know who ordered what. It's ok. It happens. Really.

It was standard Chinese lunch fare. Nothing really good or bad. It's ok. It happens. Really.

Started to notice people at other tables waiting for food or drinks or checks. It's ok. It happens. Really.

They gave us the wrong check at the end. It's ok. It happens. Really.

We waited about 15 minutes for a revised check to appear. It's ok. It happens. Really.

Our lunch hour turned into a lunch hour and a half. It's ok. It happens. Really.

"I thought the Pure Aloha Festival was going to be 'Ono, but it was more like ""Oh, no"" or even better, ""No, no.""  How bad could it have been you may ask?  Oh let me count the ways...

I counted one actual booth that was selling Hawaiian food and ne'er a poke stand to be found.  How is this possible?  Anyway, the booth we did decide to eat at offered regular cheesesteaks and a loco moco cheesesteaks, along with a side of mac salad...well they said it was mac salad.  I say it was overcooked noodles doused in mayonnaise and that's it.  And just a little note to the guy who told me they had the best mac salad, you're a liar.  On the bright side, we didn't get food poisoning.  So there's that.

After that we decided a hand dipped corndog might be good.  And it would have been, if they hand dipped it when you ordered it after a 30 minute wait in line rather than serving a pre-dipped, waiting under a warming light for you to order.  It also would have been great if they would have had plain yellow mustard instead of spicy brown, but hey, I least we didn't get sick there either.

My only other complaint is that nobody had any damn bottled water or soft drinks for sale at any of the booths we went to.  The person/people responsible for that error should be beat.

I never rode any of the rides or tried any of the carnival games there because I do not trust carnies so I can't attest to any of that stuff.

It's about time Markham gets a BBQ restaurant. Located just east of the Loblaw's / LCBO on Bullock. Lot's of parking in front of the restaurant and a good amount of seating inside. Lot's of people were stopping by for takeout. 

I visited during opening week so I Imagine they still have some kinks to work out. When we arrived, no one greeted us and we were not sure if we should sit ourselves or order at the cash first. After standing at the cash (and being ignored), we sat down. No one came to serve us at the table either. I finally got someones attention and asked how we place an order. They apologized and said they didn't see us.     

I only raise this point as I hope they use the feedback to improve since their food is amazing and I want this place to be a success (so I can keep coming back). Once we finally placed our order, the service was great.

We tried the Elvis combo (mixed platter) and the Brisket sandwich. The ribs were excellent with lot's of meat and smoked perfectly. The pulled pork and beef brisket were also very good -   great smokey / tangy flavour. The cole slaw made for a good side and the baked beans were a standout for me - love the chunks of pork in there. Fries were average at best but who cares - this place is about the BBQ.

Prices are on the low end for what you get... both quantity and quality. You can get a large delicious meal for about $10. 

I will return again when the next BBQ craving kicks in. All the kinks should be worked out by then.

"Had a killer massage this weekend with Trankie! I just moved back to Phoenix from Seattle and needed to find a new salon/spa and I think I can mark this off my list of things to do when moving. 

Honestly one of the best massages I've had in decades!! I asked for a firm medium pressure and it's exactly what I got. My neck, my back, my quads, and hamstrings were all sore from the move and these hikes I've been doing. I felt so relaxed and was no longer tense.

So the Kraken Cafe Food Truck came to Tivoli today. I figured  I give them a try. For $6 starting the menu is not bad. The operation  was 2 people and orders made fresh. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles and the worker said she had to much orders. I remind u they were here for 2 hours. So she ran out. I ordered a chicken strip  plate and grilled cheese plate. Okay but the hype is not all their with this truck. The fries was missing flavor. Yes it was tossed with parm cheese and some herbs but no taste. It was also not crispy. The chicken strip was okay. 3 pieces.  Really lightly  battered. No great taste.  Grilles cheese was was great on a sweet bread type of toast with nice cheese actually  melted.

"HOT TIP: Check your bills and credit card statements carefully if you dine here.

Update:  So, in addition to being almost overcharged on my visit to Daisho (as mentioned in the initial review), I was checked my Visa statement and I was charged twice for my lunch at Noodle Bar.

Called Visa and they confirmed that the restaurant charged $98.xx to my Visa twice (once the day I was there, another time two days after) with the same reference number.

Ultimately, I just had to email Momofuku and their service director refunded the incorrect charge and responded within 3 hours with his apologies (though, no offer of compensation or explanation).  Glad I didn't have to physically show up to get this corrected (though, I would have loved to drop, 'Where's ma money, Momofucka?"") or dispute the charge with Visa (although, this would have been simple as Momofuku clearly incorrectly charged me).

My brother, who bought a Lucky Peach magazine was also double-charged for his purchase.  He checked his statement a few days after I told him what happened and he found the same issue.

I work in the financial industry -- if something as unusual as a customer complaining about a double-charge occurred, I would check to see if this was a systemic issue and proactively contact/refund other effected customers.  It doesn't appear Momofuku were aware/tried to contact/refund my brother.  I can only hope the other diners there didn't have the same thing happen to them or they noticed the error.

Now, I'm not saying Momofuku is running a scam and I understand mistakes happen.  But from almost being charged an extra $20 on my 1st bill (minor server error) and then being double-charged on my second bill (possible employee fraud or major issues with their bookkeeping) -- what kind of an ass-backwards operation are they running?

"This is the place my neighbors told me to hit up on my first night in the neighborhood, and I've gone back more times than I can count in the past year. Sardinha is a lifesaver on those nights when you get off the subway and just want to pick up something for dinner that requires no work on your part, and head home.

For a single person, a half chicken is the perfect deal - for around 5 bucks you can have dinner tonight and one or two sandwiches for later (and if you're ambitious, you can use the carcass to make stock!).  If you're looking for a more rounded meal (or are too lazy to make your own side dish) you can get a chicken dinner for under ten bucks that includes your choice of rice with veggies or potato balls (or both).  They always have some inexpensive portugese pada style buns at the register for cheap.

"Me, and a group of ladies, were getting ready to travel to Payson, and while we were putting gas in my van, we noticed the flat tire. We took it to Discount Tires, and even though it was a busy day for them (Friday), they took care of us in a timely manner.
They took a big nail, out, patched it up, and got us ready to go, and all this... for FREE!
They are great, great customer service, Erik is the gentleman that took care of our problem.",5.0

"I had a different moving company flake out on me the day of the move, so there I was, truck in the driveway, all packed up, no movers. I called Five Star Moving to see if there was any possible chance of getting movers out that day. I figured there wasn't much hope but it didn't hurt to try. They answered immediately and were able to get me a full crew out in just a few hours. So that's Awesome Thing Number 1. 

Awesome Thing Number 2 came when the guys disassembled my IKEA beds and then reassembled them in the new place. That *was* awesome- I'd looked at them that morning and decided that it looked way too much of a pain and I'd leave it to the professionals, and I'm so glad I did.

Awesome Thing Number 3 was that the guys moved some massively heavy stuff for us. Seriously. They made it look light as a feather. And they provided their own furniture pads and dolly, so I wouldn't have to pay U-Haul for the privilege of using theirs. 

The guys were professional, friendly, they seriously hustled the whole time, and they took great care of our belongings and our house. I could go on with the Awesome Things they did for us but let me just sum it all up by saying that if we need movers again, I won't hesitate to hire them. Thanks so much- we deeply appreciate your hard work!!!",5.0
"I had a nice stay at The Embassy Suites last weekend. It's located off the strip on Paradise road, but only about 10 minutes or less from the Wynn. Our suite was clean and comfortable and the staff was great with providing extra towels and toiletries. The complimentary breakfast was also great, but it got pretty crowded at certain times so I'd recommend going earlier rather than later to avoid having to wait in the omelet station line.",4.0

"WTH were they thinking making a show like this?  What a horrible tribute to Elvis Presley, one of my all time favorite artists.  I grew up listening to Elvis because my mom is a big fan of his music so I was extremely excited to get a hold of some tickets with such good seats.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  I don't really want to go into detail without giving it away for those who still want to see it, but don't expect too much acrobatics and don't count on much of a WOW factor either.  This show lacks any depth and I really felt like they took some things from other cirque shows, manipulated it a bit, and tried to tie in a little historical/biographical/musical testament to Elvis.  It was a complete fail and some of the acts made me think, ""WTF is going on?!?!  Why is this bit in here??!? How is this even relevant?!??  When is this shit going to end!!!??  F-ing ridiculous!!!"".  Not surprisingly, I fell asleep periodically throughout the show.  I was ready to leave before it ended and felt like it was a waste of my life- how sad is that?!?!

Whatever, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, Elvis fan or not, and I would suggest you save your money and go see another show.  Fortunately for me I didn't pay for my tickets!!!  I would've been damn regretful if I had though.  On a brighter tip: the auditorium is really big and nice.  You can tell they invested a lot of money in this.  Costumes were colorful and somewhat interesting to see.  Lastly, they did play some of his classics that I loved listening to.  

Cirque, I hope you came on yelp and really take these reviews to heart.  

and....

Elvis, I apologize on behalf of Cirque for portraying you in such an atrocious fashion; what a slap in the face!!! May you rest in peace!!!",1.0
"Chloe Spa is your one stop shop for all your beauty needs! Not only do they do amazing mani/pedis but they also have a facial room for waxings and facials, and a mystic tanner! I came in for a manicure, and Kayla was my manicurist. She is patient and pays attention to the little details. I really appreciate her professionalism. My friend came in and got the mani/pedi set and she was so comfortable she fell asleep in her massage chair with two guys doting on her! (Haha!) It's been about 2 weeks since I came in and my nails are just now beginning to chip. Normally, because I wash my hands compulsively they only last about 3-4 days with regular nail polish.

"Under new management!

I have been coming here often for the last 5 years. The price was not too competitive before, but hopefully that will change with the new owner.

They also has a new computerized system. All the products I bought are now itemized on the reciepts so I know exactly how much each of them cost. Before it was just on a calculator print out... and I have no idea how they come up with the total!

They have good selections of all the premium dog food and they even bring in new brands! It is a little strange to be excited about dog food, but my dog is on a rotation wet food and dry food diet and I love to let  him to try different food.

Of course earning Airmiles is another plus to shop here!

They accepts Interac, Visa and MC, no AMEX.

They has the buy 10 get 1 free in house program which is tracked by computer.

"If you call with questions about adoptions, they will NEVER answer the phone. You get hold music forever. I waited 20 minutes after the machine said the wait time is around 1 minute. I've called 3 times trying to get info on how to adopt a new stray I saw there... Have never gotten through. It's a long drive for me so it's very inconvenient for me to travel there just to get some questions answered.

I would say around 60% if the dogs are not adoptable. They are either quarantined or strays that have to go through a waiting period. You can almost never find someone to help you look at a dog or answer questions. You can't put any dogs on hold to adopt when they become available. 

I entered a drawing for a stray puppy that became available and it was extremely fishy, pulling a number out of the box but instead of reading the winning number the lady went to the back room for a few minutes and then came out and told us some guy in another city won the dog... He wasn't even there.

I went to the back to request to walk one of the other dogs and, before I could make my request, the guy closed the door on me and I waited for about 15 minutes in the sun before he opened the door to take my request. There was around 4 others in line.

I did want to say that once they gave me the dog to play with, they have these nice play cages out back around the corner where you can throw a ball or chew toy and stuff. This is the only thing stopping it from being 1 star.

I would say there's an extremely minimal effort being put in to actually find these animals homes. It could be so much better.",2.0
"I've been going to Toni & Guy for years, not necessarily because I think they're phenomenal, but because they were convenient and better than the more affordable place by my house in which the colorist thought ""give me a partial highlight"" was synonymous with ""turn me into a skunk.""  

At T&G, the receptionists are friendly.  I like both my stylist and colorist; they're knowledgable and seem like cool chicks.  

I do have a couple of complaints, however.

The blonde in my partial highlight is never the blonde color I want it to be.  It was always turning orange!  I've been toning it at home, now, to help alleviate the problem, but this last time, instead of the light, golden blonde that I wanted, I ended up with an ash blonde that really just looks like a really washed out, dull, light brownish color.  I haven't met a colorist who has been able to create the blonde color that I want, but my colorist at T&G has done the best job so far... *sigh*

Also, I think they're too expensive; $70 for a partial highlight and another $70 for a haircut?  *dies*  The only thing more absurd than that is that there are idiots, like me, who actually pay that rate.  The one good thing, though, is that because of the high quality of the cut, I'm able to go longer periods of time between styling appointments by having my bangs trimmed (free!) when I have my roots touched up.

What's annoying, though, is that as they work their way up the ranks in the company, they are able to charge more for their services, yet, I don't see any difference in my hair.  I'm being charged twice as much, but the end result is exactly the same.  You would think that existing patrons would be provided with a grandfather clause, or something.

I guess in the end, you have to do your own cost/benefit analysis.  Is the cost of paying high prices and spending a couple of hours sitting next to some catty, teenage, Paris Hilton wannabe worth the benefit of receiving a quality haircut and/or coloring? 

For me, so far, the answer has been ""yes.""",4.0

"lately I've only been going for lunch.  gone are the late night drink fests in days past.  I must say, as the girls have come and gone, what has been a constant is the food.  some of the best bar food I've had in town.  

the menu items I have found to be just out of the park homeruns are the salmon tacos, prime rib sliders, and prime rib dip.  first time I went in for lunch was during the USA v Germany world cup match.  this place was packed with just 1 waitress, Megan.  let me tell you, this woman handled the entire room.  she was running around the place taking orders, dropping off food, refilling drinks, everything.  she never missed a beat.  I've seen waitresses do way less with 1/10 the crowd.  very good service.  the last few times I've been in for lunch it isn't busy.  but the service is always excellent.  Megan is top notch.  with the nice you get a little bit of sassy, in a good way.  

there are several beers on tap including guiness, blue moon, and shock top.  typical local bar with about 20 video poker machines all around the square bar.  there are also plush seats with big screen tv's in front of them on one side of the bar.  perfect for watching your favorite game.  

soon as you walk in you'll get a hello and a smile.  makes you feel right at home.",4.0
Great atmosphere and food but the service slacked some. First we were seated without a drink list then it took half hour to get our drinks. Our appetizers were even served before our drinks. We were told that the bar was slammed but there was barely anyone in there. We were only checked on once and it took a while to get the checj. The food overall was great. The cornbread is amazing!! We devoured it within seconds.,4.0
"I first learned about this place several years ago whilst watching a show on the Food Network about local and little-known  'foodie' havens.  In the years since, I managed to drive by the Bob Taylor's Ranch House sign off of US 95 (at Ann Rd) countless times without ever exiting and checking the place out...that all changed today, Mother's Day 2011.

Really, really good food.  Exceptionally friendly and meaningful service.  

Had the NY Strip with Ranch House Potatoes.  Perfection on a plate.  Only giving 4 stars because 5 stars, to me, should only be given to best-in-class establishments.  This place is certainly among the best I've experienced in the non-gourmet steakhouse category, but it's not the clear, undisputed leader.",4.0
My family has been in vegas since the late twenties. Bob Taylors has been here since the mid fifties. It's old Las Vegas for sure.

"I worked with Valerie this past week, in securing a unit for October. She was great to work with! Took the time to show me two separate model units that each contained features of my unit. She took the time to answer all my questions. She stayed in touch with me the entire application process to make sure all went OK. 

Apartment is in a very nice area. It's a renovated property, and very decent! A huge upgrade from where I'm living now, but thankfully for not much longer.

I will report back, once I move in. But for now, experience has been A+!

UPDATE: all moved in, and loving it! I honestly don't know where these negative reviews come from, I'm not seeing dog poop 'everywhere' as some claim. Even after the paperwork was done, the office is still great. They're always ready to help. My unit is awesome, clean, and exactly what I wanted. Some people below, just have ridiculous complaints.

Very poor service. Took 5 minutes just to be recognized that we were waiting to order. One person working on a Sunday. Waited 35 minutes for our food. Was served with no napkins. When tried to ask for some the guy working was no where to be found. Water machine disgusting and there was no ice in the soda machine. While eating a previous customer came to get a refund. Her burrito tortilla she said was hard. She warned us all to check out food before we ate. When ordering they were out of chicken. The guy working serves us our food after the long wait with headphones in his ear and you could hear the rap music he was listening to as he put our food on our table. Unfortunately it's hard to be mad because the food was actually good. It wasn't that good to forget about this experience so we will never be back.,1.0

"Air Canada now flies out of Billy Bishop Airport, which must really suck for Porter. It's exclusivity is now gone. But, that still doesn't stop me from flying Porter out of Billy Bishop's downtown airport. There is free shuttle service to BB from Royal York.

Yes, there is a 3 minute ferry that transports you from point A to point B - lets get that walking bridge constructed already.

The actual airport is so small that there is nothing except a huge lounge with free softdrinks, water, nuts/pretzels and cookies. There are sandwhiches and salads for purchase, but at $10 or more for cold cuts, I think I'll pass.

The only reason why I would go to this airport is because of Porter. Even if the same flights were offered between Air Canada and Porter, I would still chose the later. That being said, for those who furvently collect Aeroplan, you can now fly out of Billy Bishop.",4.0

"Upon entering this establishment, we were greeted with an awful odor. After a few minutes discussing it we came to the conclusion that a bathroom drain somewhere is flowing the wrong way. All this aside we decided to stay and tough it out. Some of the silverware was dirty. The bread was good! The chicken saltimbucco was over cooked and therefore dry. The saving grace was the tiramisu. It was amazing!
Our service was shaky at first but got better.
So check the smell and if u can take it, grab some bread and tiramisu and run!

"Haven't had a problem with Edison's in terms of customer service...yet. First ever time ordering I was quoted 30 minutes, and was pretty much on point when I finally found a stupid parking place in shitty Tremont. 

Honey is weird, but, it works well. My order was accurate, and cooked correctly. By that I mean taking it out of the pan, and putting back in to cook more due to the toppings. Really love the garlicky tang of the sauce, and the sprinkle of Parmesan around the crust is always a nice touch.

The only issue, which is nice, is that there really isn't topping limits. Whatever you order in excess of 2 toppings is just piled on like its one topping each time. Usually it's the more toppings your order, the less other amount of each one. I ordered half pepperoni and mushroom, and the half was covered in pepperoni, and a shit load of mushrooms. This made it so most of the cheese wasn't melted, and the crust underneath a little doughy. I give them credit for putting the pizza back in more to account for this, but, you can't cook a pizza properly with all the shit on top and no way for the heat to penetrate all the layers. 

Sausage is amazing though. You don't see that style of sausage anywhere these days. I bet it the raw, pulled, style. As it should be. 

I'm a fan of Edison's so far.",3.0
"I really try and support local hardware retailers (granted this isn't local, but it's not ""big box"") as I worked at a small chain back in school.  However I cringe when I have to go here, the staff hasn't been too friendly to me.

I ordered something online and for the longest time the tracking simply said the item had been shipped, meanwhile I ordered something via Home Depot after ACE and it came before!  It seemed like the error was the store received the product but never scanned it in, thus I thought it was still in transit.

The past 2 times I've gone there, 15-20 min before closing, the employees are huddled at the front of the store and immediately ask me what I'm looking (in not the nicest tone) for because they close soon.  It just seems very pushy, as I'll go to Home Depot or Lowes 5 min before closing and I don't get asked.

I most likely would have bought more items if I didn't feel like they wanted to shut up shop early for the night.  I'll continue to go here for items on my way home, but not for my main hardware needs.",2.0

"I have been a regular their for the past 2 years, even though they have horrible service their food was always worth it. But the other day they crossed the line and we will never go back. The waitress was super rude when we asked for an extra bowl to share. Even went as far to make a face at me behind my back which my girlfriend saw. On top of that they never came back to refill waters or provide any service. Then when we went to pay, after swiping our card, the lady tells us that gratuity was added. 
I honestly was going to let the horrible service of that day go and come back again because to be honest I've grown used to their horrible service but they crossed the line when they added grat and didn't tell us until after swiping our card. 
Mind you, we were just a party of two and the auto grat only came out to $2 and some change but I find that extremely shady. Also keep in mind that we always tipped above 20% when we ate there. 
Kind of breaks my heart because I loved their malay laksa soup but a restaurant that does not value their customers does not deserve my business.",1.0

"The main reason I did not give SCNM one star is because the residents are actually really great people who care about the patients that they are working with.  They genuinely listen and spend a great deal of time with you.  

Now, the reason I would not give them more than two stars at SCNM is because they seem to lure you in with their ""cheaper"" prices to be seen by a student.  The doctor did not stay in the room with them while they asked me questions, when they went to collaborate over my treatment plan with their supervising doctor, I was often left waiting for 45 minutes or so.  I have spent full afternoons here.  Some may say that's not a big deal but here is where it gets frustrating.  Even though my initial cost was cheaper, I still spent close to $600 in a month here and my issues were not resolved, they seemed to barely etch the surface.  They wanted me to follow up with them weekly at $75 a pop and wanted me to do labs that b/c the Doctor did not write the request properly, I had to pay $60 when my insurance would have covered it if it had been ordered properly.   I felt that I had to do quite a bit of my own coordinating within their own medical center, I had to tell their lab that the doctor requested that I get a sensitivity test done to which they had no paperwork on and wanted to charge me about $270 for it.     I felt that their treatment plan was arbitrary and designed to give the students an opportunity to practice their modalities on me.  One part of my suggested treatment plan was to come in bi-weekly for hydrotherapy sessions which would be under my follow up visit price of $75. That is far more expensive than a professional massage.   I did not fully understand why I needed hydrotherapy considering I was going for food sensitivities and GI issues.  I will give the doctor grace on this but I was prescribed a botanical tincture that had grain alcohol as its base.  For someone with a suspected gluten sensitivity (at the time, now confirmed by my labs), I am not sure how wise or thought out this was.  So, all in all, my recommendation would be to go to a Naturopath or Integrative medicine doctor (one who is both an MD and ND) who is already well-established in their practice.  Yes, it will be expensive upfront (about $300) but I recommend finding someone who will actually guide you through an insurance reimbursement process. The staff at SCNM did not help with this at all and the current doctor I am seeing's staff really encourages trying to get reimbursed by your insurance.  If one can put in $300 to see a fully qualified and well-practiced ND, they will then be able to be treated in one visit.  They will not need to go to multiple visits in a month with trial-and-error supplements, labs, and modalities.  In the time that it took for SCNM to find my food sensitivities and find ""medical grounds"" for me to have that test done, I would have saved $100's in follow up visit fees.   The other thing is- most of the ND's who teach the students at SCNM are practitioners who are trying to build their practice and have no been in the field long enough. 

*Another thing that raised a red flag for me was that it took them 2+ visits to finally ask me to get lab work done and it also took them THAT long to have me sign my ROI for my records with other doctors. I found this really suspicious and there was a lack of urgency there.  I think labs should be requested on the first visit, so that on the second visit the doctor can compare your past results with your current ones.  It shouldn't take 3 visits to acknowledge a basic health panel like the CMP needs to be done.",2.0
"If you are into people watching, seeing cover bands playing classic rock, and looking at the all the freaks Las Vegas has to offer then this place is for you.  There are many casinos here with affordable tables, and the chance to see something out of the ordinary is a sure thing on Fremont street.  Oh yeah, there are also many places to find alcohol so how could you go wrong here.  Grab a drink, walk the street, and enjoy the show.

After reading other reviews I have to add...many of the casinos are very nice and clean.  Check out the Golden Nugget, Plaza, and of course Fremont.  They aren't the new ritzy places but they are nice and friendly.

There are indeed a lot of performers, and some are literally hanging out of their clothes but it is all part of the experience, just don't bring the kids.

There were a few beggars but coming from L.A. and visiting New York a few times it actually looked like things were going well in downtown Vegas.

Finally, I didn't see one crack head on Fremont street, but if that is the wild life you are looking for the bus station is just a couple blocks away.  I'm sure there is a great risk of being pick pocketed here just like any other place with a large crowd, but there is also a ton of security and cops.

"7 West, a bit of a strange joint, kind of Janus-faced .... half the week (Sun-Wed) in the evenings it is a relaxed, chill place great for reading or discussions. In other words, an actual cafe. The other half? It's a bar, plain and simple - loud (great music though) and crowded. 

The service is pretty good, and unlike a lot of places in Toronto, it's easy to strike up a conversation with your server - in fact, I would say the biggest plus to the place is that (sorry to say) un-Toronto vibe that allows total strangers to talk to each other. The best part of 7 West is how friendly and open the place can be, servers and customers alike, at any time of day. 

While the obvious time to come here is at night, I would recommend coming during the day as well - it's a neat place to hang out. 

While the service is good and the atmosphere great, the prices aren't, and the food is passable. I would say the prices are high, especially for what you're getting ($7 for a bottle of Guinness? Really?). 

7 West has found a niche, and kudos for them, I say. But I would also say it's unfortunate that it is the only place of its kind in this part of Toronto - we need more places like this, not only for its hours, but the atmosphere as well.",3.0
"There are already a bunch of positive reviews, but I am so happy about this place that I want to do anything I can to keep it in business.

I am absolutely thrilled that there is a boba place in the northwest. Tea Time has the familiar boba drinks, including my all time favorite of rose milk tea. They also serve a variety of snacks including peanut butter slathered on a piece of toast that looks like it's about 2 inches thick.

I tried a new flavor - peppermint milk tea. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but since the cashier talked me into it he said he'd make me a new one if I didn't like it. He was considerate and personable, and I appreciated it. It turns out that I really enjoyed the peppermint milk tea. It was refreshing and perfect for such a hot day.

I will definitely go back, especially since they have food options and wireless. They also have a frequent buyer card - buy 10 boba teas and get the 11th free.",5.0

"Just six days before my wedding, my future mother-in-law offered to pay for some flowers for our wedding. My fiancé and I were paying for the wedding ourselves so had agreed flowers were not a big part of it. I was happy to pick up a bouquet of roses that morning to walk down the aisle with. Needless to say, with the offer of his mom, we jumped on the opportunity. We spoke to Amy who agreed to meet with us on Monday morning. We literally were speaking to her as we were driving to the shop. She said she had limited time as she had another appointment to get to. That was fine with us as we understood the time crunch. However, once there, she spent all the time we needed to order five bouquets & boutonnieres as well as a few additional floral items. Not only were we able to order all the flowers we needed, she was able to keep them within our budget. We picked them up on Saturday and were very pleased. They were absolutely beautiful!! Not saying this is the norm in which she can complete wedding arrangements, however, we lucked out on a holiday weekend and slower time. She could have easily said no due to the very short timeframe.

"So far in my 5 trips, I've stayed at Mandalay, Aria, Ballys, Planet Hollywood, and now Flamingo. Flamingo in my opinion has been the best bang-for-your-buck. I booked the lowest priced room, but was able to upgrade to the GO rooms  (they have the big white cushion headboards). I thought the room was great! My room was on the 22nd floor, w/ a view of the Bellagio Fountains. The room was clean, flat screen TV, stereo system, couch, TV built into the bathroom mirror, shower and tub. Shower had 2 mid-level jets too!

What I liked:

- Centrally located on the Strip, easy to get places. 
- Room had an EMPTY mini fridge. (High-end hotels have triggers that charge you if you remove anything from them, low-end hotels have nothing and I end up bringing a cooler and refilling w/ ice. Having this allowed me to stock it with my own beers and drinks! 
- Flat-screen (amazingly, some places still don't have these) 
- TV built into the mirror in bathroom
- Stereo w/ Sub. Great for getting ready and pre-gaming
- Remote Drapes
- Express Check-out from your TV

Things I didn't like:

- They note an iPod docking station, but people have stolen every cord so they just don't stock it. Furthermore, that is not a normal docking connector. I recommend brining a male-to-male headphone jack cable and you'll be good to go!
- Bathroom sliding door leaves very little privacy. You may want to blast the TV in there and run bathtub if you want to cover up any awkward sounds. Or just use the lobby restrooms. 
- Like most places, you pay for internet.. But I have a free mobile hotspot feature on my phone so we just used that and were fine. 
- Charged me $1.25 for local calls. Remember to use your cell phone going forward.

"Hated this hotel. I stayed here for 3 days and didn't like it a lot. The room that I stayed in was dirty and ghetto. My friends stayed at a ""deluxe"" room and the decor was better, but not worth it unless you get the upgrade for free. 

The casino is not as nice either. The only good part about this hotel was the swimming pool.",2.0

"Today I drove from Goodyear to far away Mesa to try out Moki's. I found them while searching for a Hawaiian style caterer for an upcoming social event. I tried out several of their dishes and loved all of them. The presentation of the food is lovely, the service is friendly and the food was tasty. I especially liked the Sticky Chicken and Hawaiian Salad. Even the Macaroni Salad, which I'm not usually keen on, was fresh and tasted homemade. We're going to use them for our event and I'm willing to make the drive again to try out other menu items.",5.0
Have been here many times over the past year....the burgers are consistently delicious and the staff does a good job of keeping the restaurant clean.  The service is always quick and friendly.  The cost is a few bucks higher than the chain places close by but you get what you pay for.  In my opinion the best place to go if you're not in the mood to fire up the grill.,5.0

"Read all the reviews and thought it would be a cool tapas place to try, but such a disappointment (even with a certificate from restaurant.com).

This place lacks service, not only do you seat yourself but the server's eyes are glued to the game on tv. The server was unaware of our existence.

Food is below par. See the following:
Chicken and waffles, four overcooked dry wings and some criscut fries and gravy. Blahhh....
Tator tots with Parmesan and truffle just tasted like fried mashed potatoes. Bland and hardly any parm nor truffle. 
Wagyu slider, the patty was dry 
Spicy tuna and this other fried roll according to the bf is better at the buffet.  Rolls not only looked dreadful but the taste and texture confirms it. Imitation crab meat was used and it's extremely pricey for food that taste like crap. 

I guess the restaurant has no customers because they lowered their standards. Should've went to mr luckys instead...",2.0
"I didn't write this review immediately. My friend and I were out at dinner at a different restaurant the other night and while we were eating our appetizer,  I was thinking about our dinner at Monterey and said,

""Hey, remember those chicken and waffle nachos??"" 
He paused mid chew, frowning. ""Why would you make me hate the food that's currently in my mouth? It's not bad. It's really good. But I HATE it."" (They were awesome good mac and cheese bites, for reference) 

I should have written my review immediately.

We were up one weeknight and needed a late night meal. The kitchen was open until 10, so we headed out on a whim, looking for a place we hadn't been before. Monterey won due to its yelp reviews and I'm so glad it did. 

Normally, the mere concept of chicken and waffles kind of wigs me out and the description of them normally doesn't win my craving at all. It's been one of those dishes I've always been aware of that I simply filed under weird and never ordered, like Monte Cristo sandwiches. So I'm thanking the food gods that that night I went against my normal ordering habits and got them as my meal.

And they ARE a meal, don't worry.

""Belgian waffles, maple syrup, bacon, and pieces of fried chicken drizzled with jalapeno berry jam.""

I think it was the jalepeno berry jam that hooked me and I don't even LIKE or EVER EAT jalepenos, but the combo sounded promising and I lept. I was not wrong. It was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was fate.

Outtakes of our conversation that evening re THE NACHOS:

""They had this perfect thing, and THEN they put bacon on it and they didn't even have to but they did and OH MY GOD.""
and
""It's not even that it's a waffle, it's that they take the waffle and THEN deep fry it and I can't stop eating.""

So. You should go. Right now. Get the waffles. Get other stuff too I guess. 

(Oh yeah, our beers were good, the location quaint, the atmosphere was neighborly, the staff friendly, my friend's Guinness Shredded Beef Boaty was also delicious, and the menu interesting enough to keep us coming back for some traditional Irish fare, but more importantly....)

Chicken. and. Waffle. Nachos.",5.0

"The wife and I have driven past this small enclave of Bavaria on Kingston Road in Ajax multiple times and said we should try it out.  

So we stopped by. Before entering I checked Yelp!  Sadly there were only 5 reviews but with the majority offering 4 of 5 stars we went it.  

The place is the German version of an English pub.  We were there at 6:15 pm on a Thursday.  There was only us and another couple there.  

My wife noticed a musty smell.  Similar to a cottage being opened for the first time.  We had the pork schnitzel.  But you don't go to a German pub for a hamburger or veal parmigiana.  I had the breaded schnitzel and my wife had un breaded with gravy and spatzel.  

Both meals were hot and the portions decent.  I found that I needed something on my schnitzel as it was dry especially with home fries and red cabbage.  My wife felt hers was a bit tasteless.

I guess I was underwhelmed by the food but the musty smell and lack of customers left us with a cold experience.",2.0

"El Paso Mexican Grill has been in Bridgeville for awhile now, and I have never visited there! My boyfriend was at Rumfish Grille for happy hour on Friday night and was planning on picking us up dinner. I knew this place was right next door so I suggested stopping there. 

The menu was hard to find online (maybe a lot of people don't order take out from here?) I don't even know if I ordered from the right menu to be honest! I ended up just ordering soft tacos- they come with 3 so I got 2 chicken and 1 beef. Chris wanted the ""Cielo Mar y Tierra"" it was some kind of mixed skillet. I also ordered us chips and guacamole. My tacos arrived really soggy and Chris's meal wasn't even what I ordered! The guacamole also wasn't very good and didn't seem homemade- how can ya even mess up guac?!

Last, when  I called to order, all of the workers were extremely rude. I talked to about 3 different people on the phone when I called which was also kind of weird. I can think of about 15 other Mexican places I would go before coming back to El Paso.",1.0

"What is it about Asian donut shops? I had been a fan of Bosa Donuts but there aren't any all that close to my home and my wife had wanted to find another place nearby and found Beyond Donuts so we gave it a try. We were both very impressed. The raised Donuts are so incredibly soft and the ones with a glaze melt in your mouth. I prefer a plain raised glazed and either a lemon- or raspberry-filled, preferably with powdered sugar but glazed will do if the other isn't available.

I actually picked up some Bosa and Beyond Donuts to do a direct comparison and Beyond's are better.

Having donuts like this will make you never want to try supermarket donuts ever again and Dunkin' Donuts and Crispy Creme aren't even in the same league. Give Beyond Donuts a try, you will not be disappointed.",5.0
"$45 w/ jewelry 

My navel ring came out crooked! After two weeks, I was super upset since eveyone started noticing how crooked it was. I had to get it repierced somewhere else. My helix had to be redone three times since the earring kept getting pushed out. The most painful experience I had for a cartilage piercing. 

I had an allergic reaction to the body jewelries. Surgical steel is not supposed to give me an allergic reaction they said 
Sike! I told them I was highly allergic to most metals. The only one I wasn't allergic to was gold or white gold. And the guy said surgical steel wouldn't give me an allergic reaction. Unfortunately, it did still and now i have a couple of rashes around the area where the ring is supposed to be.

"This spot popped up recently on my side of town. I love Hawaiian food so I of course I had to give it a go. 
On my first visit it was completely empty. Be prepared it's a dive, but dives are the best. It's run by the owners who definitely work hard. Their food is fresh and made with love. So far I've tried their Hawaiian bbq chicken which came with lots of rice and lots of chicken to my surprise Also, a combo plate of the chicken and beef. Both very full of flavor and not dry at all. Loco Moco is well priced for the abundance of food you receive. The taste is excellent as far as the main entree is concerned. The Mac salad not my favorite. Other then that I love that they have a protein driven menu with tasty sauces. My kind of place!",4.0
"PLEASE READ BEFORE SIGNING UP! It is a shame that I have to award this event a star at all. THIS IS NOT A 5K!!! There was not information provided before the event. It took us 30 minutes to find the event as there was no signage. The staff at the park had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about the event. No variety of shirt sizes available - large only. Start/finish sign was tied between two small trees. We were instructed to arrive at 1 pm for a 3pm race, but the announcer began discussing a countdown at 2pm. Every 10 minutes he would get on the mike and say 5 more minutes. The event leaders were all teenagers that provided no assistance. The so called ""color stations"" was a mother with her 5 year old throwing color out of cups or a teenager. We finished the course in 10 minutes as there was no signs directing us. In fact markings in the grass were left from a prior race!!!! It was mass confusion. The announcer went and stood in the middle as we lapped the course (since we finished before getting in a mile). The entire course was well under a 5K. I have already contacted Groupon requesting a refund and encourage everyone else too also. I am hoping they will stop promoting this vendor so runners can donate their resources to true 5K events.",1.0
"Room was spacious and clean.  Three stars was earned when they ""upgraded"" us to a suite on the 7th floor with a view of a wall.

Lounge was very nice & food/drinks were terrific.  Call ahead for dinner reservations, they were booked solid for the evening.  Staff at the lounge won't book you dinner reservations, and don't expect to find an open table when you drop down from the lounge to the restaurant.  FYI - it is a very long walk to the tower from the hotel.",3.0

"Not well run, to the point that it is frighteningly bad. Don't let the price deal suck you in.  One check in person but they have you get in line with the Thrifty line even though no one with thrifty can help check you in and it's a super long line.  Check in lady is super nice but they clearly need more people on for their reservations.

After waiting in line an hour, and being told there would be a row of full sized cars for me to choose from for my RESERVATION placed weeks before my trip, I got downstairs to several people who had been in front of me in line waiting b/c there were ZERO cars that we all had paid for available and no one working here had any idea when more would be available, once it was possible to even track a person down and the attitude was so aloof regarding the matter.  I wasn't even sure I was dealing with the right people based on seeming lack of concern and attire.  I was given a solution of going back upstairs and going to Dollar Rental to try to get a car from them.  When I pointed out that I had a reservation for weeks with their company and had waited in line for over an hour AND had already gone through the payment contract, the gal shrugged her shoulders.  I asked, ""so how exactly would that work?"" And she said they are all affiliated.  

Turns out they had two of the smaller sized cars left and the people before me took those instead of waiting.  There was one full sized car off to the side & asked another attendant if it was available & she said, ""sure, if you don't want to wait."" I went over desperate to get in a car and on the road for my trip, but as I approached, there was damage to the vehicle, just noticeable scratched on the paint job, though not where it wasn't drivable. As I started to pull away, I asked once again to the attendants if there was any issue with me driving that car and whom would document the existing issues with the vehicle.  They just point to the checkout gate.  

I pull up to the gate and a lady taps the windshield where there is some marking on it & tells me curtly that I can't leave with that car.  I told her what I just went through and she shrugs too and tells me to turn the car around and go back to see the attendants for assistance.  I then pointed out that those same attendants said it was ok for me to drive that car, but she says I have to go back.  I get back and they aren't even there.  I start talking to some other guy who didn't really seem to speak English but implied I would just have to wait until someone showed up with a car. The lady from the gate came walking back down and seemed to casually take the responsibility of finally helping me.  There was another car in an entirely different area they got me in which is why this is two stars and not one.  Though it took begging for help,  they got me on the road and for that I do appreciate. Shame it had to get to that. 

Car turned out to be great for the trip after that whole ordeal, but I dreaded the return process. Made sure to get back a little early.  Thankfully that process was quick and smooth.  

I've never been through an ordeal like this with a rental car and absolutely cannot understand how this sort of business practice can be allowed. THEY ARE AFFILIATED WITH THRIFTY AT THIS LOCATION & I would stay away from them as well.",2.0

Their crinkle cut fries were crispy and perfectly salted. If you're a fan of cheese then get the cheese fries.

When we tasted each of our three pies, meatballs and brownie, I just couldn't believe this place could even open a pizza place, let alone pawn this off as pizza!

"Can we just take a moment and taco 'bout this place on King West?

As a self-proclaiming taco-lover, I have seen way too many pictures on social media for me to not head over and try it myself. We came on a Friday night (late though, around 8:30pm) and it was quite packed.

The first thing we got was the guac and chips. Wowz, let's just say we both loved them. We couldn't talk for a while cause we were both busy munching away.
 The chips were thick-ish and warm, while the guac was just a bunch of smashed up avocados with nothing else. (y) amaze. 

I ordered three tacos.
- Chicken Tinga | pulled chicken with guacamole and cotija cheese on a cripsy corn tortilla
- Pork | pulled pork, pickled red onion, jalapeno-cilantro crema, and cotija cheese in flour tortilla
- Baja Fish | beer battered mahi-mahi, cabbage, pico de gallo, and chiptole creme in a corn tortilla 

All three were absolutely delicious. I normally do not enjoy hard shelled tacos but the chicken one was my favorite! It could also be due to the fact that it had guac but still bomb. The sauces on the other two were also really good. I've had better tacos but I still enjoyed these.",4.0

"This review is very late, but the problems I am experiencing are still relative to my last visit to EcoWash. I have taken my car here for repairs and services over the past couple of years. I was happy with their services, but my last experience has left me looking for a new shop. I took my car in for some clutch repairs almost three months ago because of chirping. The mechanics let me know what the issues were and we had them do the repairs.

I started noticing the same noise issue coming back. So we called Ecowash. The person who took our call told us we could come in any time. When we showed up the next day nobody knew we were coming in. That was OK, the lady up front took us in. I had no plans that weekend, so my car could be left overnight if needed. When I brought my car in that Thursday, I had a recording of my car demonstrating the noise after travelling eight miles from a cold start.

My car was at Ecowash for four full days. We called towards the end of the day on Monday and were told that they couldn't figure out what was wrong and that the only way they could replicate the sound was by driving the vehicle hard. The technician's recommendation was to drive the car until a part failed. I do not ride or pop my clutch and I am very rarely ever in the upper power-band.

The three month warranty expired shortly after that visit. The clutch chirping has got considerably worse over the following couple of months. At present day, there is rarely a time when it doesn't make noise. I will just have to deal with it until I can save up enough money to have a competent shop take a look at my car.",1.0
"Decided to go give a local business some support as I yearn for a curry every once in a while. We don't eat out that much. We did a groupon. Found the place fairly easily but when you get there, there are a couple of businesses on the lower floor. The entrance is on the side of the building and you have to go upstairs so a little odd. The decor is kind upbeat almost night-clubby feel. Definitely not the  traditional Indian curry house set up. Still the spices wafting through the air made us hungry and it wasn't long before our order hit the table. The place was not busy at all.

The waiter was friendly and attentive. The view was great as you could watch planes coming in to land at the airport. The meal was good although on the smaller portion side.

"Love it love it love it. I always get the pepperoni, bacon, and ham on firecracker. Only thing I don't like is even if you're paying for your custom pizza and ask them for more, they barely add any. Other than that. Love the pizza here",4.0
I had the King Crab/Shrimp Chile Relleno. It was one of the best meals I have ever had.   We were a party of 6 and EVERYONE loved their food. Highly recommend.,5.0
"Why did it take me so long to try this place out? This place is wonderful in a lot of ways. They're carefully tucked away in a usually busy shopping complex, right next to a beautiful fountain, I would eat outside if it wasn't 98 degrees in Charlotte now. It's a lot more of a fast-foody feel which I do like because it's quick and casual, but I do sometimes wish the decor was a little more inviting (that might just be a personal thing). But I think it would move it into a dinner type of place. I'm not sure what exactly they could do though...

Their special plates are the real gem that I zone in on. It's so inexpensive for such flavorful stuff! I've tried their tacos and I will always get the fish ones because they are so well seasoned! The fish is so flaky and soft, while the taco itself is usually well toasted to soak up the yummy sauces. The greens in the taco are also unusual but very welcome I LOVE cilantro and the rest of that cabbage-carrot-mix! I've also had the pleasure of trying the 1/2 chicken and the chicken plate with hot sauce. Those are also quite satisfactory. Not to mention the 1/2 chicken is massive. It does not even fit in a to-go box very well. There are little drum sticks poking out of the box. Ha! The grilled zucchini is also a winner. 

I don't really think I can rave enough. I think everyone should go here for some inexpensive and tastey food! They are pretty quick at to-go orders as well. I went in there when it was quite busy (just now) and they got my two dishes to  me in about 10 minutes.",4.0
Great price and the owner is very nice!  Shortest wait I've ever had waiting for a smog check here in Las Vegas.,5.0
"Best place for Vietnamese sandwiches! They also have good coffee but they put so much ice in it that you only get a little bit of coffee! 

The food is affordable, they only accept cash only.

The croissant sandwiches are pretty good too. The roast beef one is a winner.",4.0

"Ah, North of Brooklyn. I've wanted to try this place forever it seems and I finally had the chance this week. I had the 'white' (arugula and ricotta - seems to be the most expensive on a per-slice basis so I'd recommend buying a full pie if you're eating with friends as the prices for larger sizes seem standard across pizza type). It was a decent pizza but the crust was a bit too thick and hard for my taste and for whatever reason the flour from the base kept crumbling off and thus it was somewhat of a messy eat. I wouldn't recommend delivery if you're in the financial district as the wait time is rather long but for a quick bite when you're in the area this isn't bad at all - still more of a Queen Margherita fan for now though!",3.0
Probably the best quiche i have ever had! The service was great. I am giving it 4 stars because it was a little crowded and too small which made it uncomfortable. The food was awesome though.,4.0
I'm not really good a reviewing so excuse this: this place has really great authentic gyro with some great menu combinations,5.0
"Four stars only because of the sushi, which was very good for a buffet. Generous amounts of fish and no need to order just pick it up. The rest of the food was mediocre. I would go back for sushi especially around lunch. All you can eat sushi for around ten dollars.  Can't beat it",4.0
"Nothing bad to say about Venicia. It is an awesome place to live. The location is perfect. 15-20mins from the strip. Grocery & gas are close by. There's great shopping and restaurants all within a 5 minute drive.

"This was my first trip to Ulta's and it was actually a real fun shopping experience!

They have everything here, lotions, perfumes, nail polish and makeup! I didn't know where to begin! There were really nice associates to help you with your purchases and to do sample makeup so you can see the products before you buy!

I loved that they had a lot of sales like B1G1 for makeup and nail polishes! I enjoyed shopping around in here and would definitely return...especially with all the great deals!",3.0

This place was AMAZING. I cannot stress enough how fresh, light, fluffy and good these were. They are like the good-twin of Dunkin Donuts, hiding out in secrecy in a small shopping mall. These are what all donuts should be (vegan and fresh and good!)

Best: jelly donut, chocolate frosted and...the munchkins!!! Oh the munchkins. I would like one ball pit full of these, please.

The owners are absolutely kind, polite, awesome people. Best ever.

"We stopped in Le Chalet for dessert because my friend wanted to check it out. I am SO happy we did! I'd very highly recommend Le Chalet to anyone who wants delicious food, excellent service and a unique atmosphere. 

When you go, sit at the crepe bar. We did and quite enjoyed learning all about the dishes from two of the chefs, Kyle and Emily. They were quite welcoming as was our server. 

Their homemade caramel is to die for! I'm excited to go back for dinner very soon. Le Chalet is one of those restaurants that's worth telling the whole world about, or at least the whole Valley!",5.0
"I decided to eat at La Casa because of their Groupon and my love for tapas. The food is pricey, but in range for what a good tapas restaurant normally costs. However, their food was way below par and not worth the cost. 

The highlight of the evening was the mussels dish in white wine sauce, which were flavorful and well-prepared. However, the experience quickly went downhill from there. The baked manchego tasted like frozen mozzarella sticks. The Moroccan spring rolls were bland and with a strange teriyaki dipping sauce. The crab cake with mango sauce was okay, but also not very flavorful. The patatas bravas tasted quite good, though they were not nearly as crispy as I normally like. The flavor made up for the mushy texture, but I think they mostly tasted that good in comparison to the rest of the food. In addition, their sangria was decent, but not great.

The ambiance was fantastic. The back porch area is lovely in nice weather. However, even with the groupon, this is not a place I would come back to.",2.0
"When we arrived at our apartment, we found the carpet cleaners inside and our carpets completely drenched. Jeff gave us some excuse that we'd arrived earlier than they thought and so our apartment wasn't ready, though it wouldn't have been dry for another day, at least. They left a giant fan with us to dry our apartment ourselves and we spent the next week rotating our moving boxes on our wet carpet attempting to dry every spot, but it still left a stench for our entire stay. As if that wasn't bad enough, we found dead cockroaches in every single kitchen drawer and cabinet, several that had been painted over--clearly someone had seen the cockroaches, but instead of cleaning the mess, chose to ignore them and sealed them in with a coat of paint. When I complained to Jeff, his response was that he was sure it wasn't intentional and that he'd send an exterminator over right away. For the already dead bugs. At some point, our bathroom faucet had a leak underneath, and maintenance ""fixed"" the problem with some duct tape. Also while we were staying there, a dead body was found inside the dumpster, so that was exciting. And finally--we'd moved into the apartment with a special they were offering, one month free rent. We'd asked before moving in if there was a penalty for breaking our year lease early, and Jeff told us the only penalty was paying back the free month's rent we were given. However, when the time came to break our lease, we were told that not only did we have to forfeit the free month's lease, we also had to pay an extra month's rent on top of that. So that was a nice surprise. One star is being very generous, though maybe they deserve it for the low price and the great location.",1.0
"Amore is a great match of personality with great service and bar staff, the food is absolutely killer and it's locally-owned and operated so when the owner asks you how your experience was, he actually means it.

Kicks the competition square in the rump.",5.0
"If you go for just pizza or ribs they are great. I ordered some wings though and i can say honestly they were the smallest wings i have ever seen. The wing sauce was not the best either. I thought i was getting a good deal at 12 wings for the same price as others charge for 10 but after eating all 12 i was still left wanting. I have also found their side dishes with dinner are old tasting. Say no to cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni. Fries are ok though.",3.0
"This place is great! The owner is absolutely the nicest guy around and he makes quite the effort in remembering who you are, what comics or characters you like and your opinion on what is going on in the shop. The fact that it moved into a larger building is is quite exciting since now they can expand even more and Ken can squeeze even more unique and original product in. 

They regularly attend geek-awesome events like Phoenix Comicon and Arizona Amazing Con in addition to being members of Local First Arizona which supports efforts in helping shoppers understand why shopping locally is so important to our community and how vast the positive effects are. 

The collectible action figure selection is awesome, posters are prints that can be hard to find elsewhere and the comics themselves always have me discovering something new. I am a customer for life!",5.0

"This is my go-to Target. The workers have always been nice to me and ask if I need help (I must look like I need help).

Its your basic Target except its split into two stories. Not a big deal, but you have to be very organized when shopping here or you end up going up and down and up and down and up and down. Especially not convenient if you have a small child riding in your cart and you have to wait for the elevator. 

The other issue that I have run into is that the staff don't re-distribute the carts. So if the majority of the carts end up on the 1st level, and you park on the second level you have to hunt down a cart.",3.0

"This is a very nice place to do karaoke and get drunk in private rooms with your friends.  I can't believe that no one has reviewed it yet!  
You have to pay for a room, which I think is usually around $200. They have hourly rates: www.bar-plus.com  They have 3 sized rooms: from small to large.
The drinks are pretty expensive for a karaoke place but the decor is nicer than all the other places I've seen.  Their selections for songs are huge and they have Chinese, Korean and English... And probably other languages too.
This place is great for group events and birthdays!  I've been to many birthdays here.",4.0

"I LOVE THIS PLACE,  This is amazing gem found in Cleveland that you just wouldn't expect.  Yes it is a bit harder to get here but once you know that you get off Edgewater/Whiskey Island exit and go down a long and winding road, around water treatment plants and buildings, you can visit a little piece of heaven.  As a huge volleyball fanatic, whiskey island supports a beautiful community full of food, music, fun and most importantly VOLLEYBALL! No matter the skill, there is a league/division that even the most enthusiastic picnic volleyballer can play in.  The nets are in good shape and the area is beautiful with a dock and boats surrounding you.  I was so surprised that this was one of my first visit until just recently, but this is definitely something I will be visiting more often.  Just coming here and relaxing with friends is something I would definitely recommend on a sunny and beautiful day in Cleveland!  People need to preserve these beautiful spots, because it is one of Cleveland's hidden gem!",5.0
"Wow.  This was the best customer service I've had in a very long time - I'm talking like decades.  I had a biking jacket given to me as a Christmas gift - it was too small.  I brought it in without a receipt.  Exhale was happy to exchange it for me. They did not have my size in stock in that same style.  I was told that they would be able to order one for me.  I was also given the option of an in-store credit.  Instead, I selected another style of jacket that was slightly more expensive.  Exhale covered the difference!  I was astonished.

They have a great selection of (mostly Specialized brand) products.  But outstanding customer service.  Despite the fact that this is not the closest shop to my house, this will be my bike shop of choice.",5.0
"I really enjoyed lunch here. The tortas were very unique and delicious! Full of flavor very good combinations. I had a norteña torta, it was packed with avocado and cheese. Yum!! The USA torta was good too. 

Our waitress was very friendly. Always smiling and making aure we were doing good. 

Boo-hoo no beer is sold but its not a big deal, get an  agua fresca or a liquado instead, those are great as well!

Overall you have to appreciate this place for what it is, a local torta restaurant, well worth the trip!",4.0
"Phoenix is lucky to have a theater like this, and by that I mean one that brings in the documentaries, foreign films, and award nominees that don't get play in the regular multiplexes.

Sure, other towns sometimes have one art theater that will play a limited selection of these movies, but to have a multi-screen theater that runs these films continuously throughout the year is just a treat and Harkin's Theatres should be commended for making this available.

Yes, it's a little dated inside, and I do wish they had stadium seating, but those are minor complaints. In fact, I'm old enough to remember going to see Tron when it was first released in 1982 at the Camelview (before the mall even had another theater) and I loved the theater then and I still love it today.

I certainly hope the rumors that this theater will be demolished to make room for more mall expansion are just rumors because the Camelview Theater is a shining point of light for cinephiles in the Valley and it deserves to remain so.",4.0
"Finally made it out to Firefly on our last Vegas trip. The food was good - loved the mussels in curry sauce and the sangria the most. However, the service was very confusing! After a few minutes of being seated, a waiter came up to ask us if we've been helped. The tables aren't assigned? After that, it was hard to find the guy, and he forgot one of our orders. When we told him that he forgot, he said oh I'm sorry and stared at us as if to ask what we'd like him to do. Anyway, at least the food was good!",4.0
They did it again! This specific location always goes above and beyond to service the customer.

Thank you again!,5.0
"This used to be such a fabulous mall.  I have been coming here since it was an outdoor mall, and have enjoyed watching it grow through the years.

Over the past several years the folks at the kiosks in the mall have gotten more and more pushy.  They offer you a ""free sample"" and then when you politely decline they continue harassing you.  This places the customers of the mall in an uncomfortable position.  We don't want to be rude, and they force us to repeatedly decline.  For folks who don't know any better they reach to accept the free sample and the salespeople coerce them over to their kiosk where things get even more uncomfortable and pushy.

Don't go near Neiman Marcus or Dillard's on the top level!  The people at the new Lioness store are just obnoxious.  They call across the entire area where the floor opens to the level below to try to get people to come into their store.  ""Dear!  Dear!"" the guy calls out.  If you ignore them they keep calling and calling.  How sad is that?  The Orogold store was the same.  I always avoided that whole side of that level because I knew they would jump out at me as I passed.  On the top level heading toward Charming Charlie's is a kiosk that is much the same, so I don't even go to that part of the mall anymore.  On the lower level near the Walking Shoe store are two more that make people VERY uncomfortable.  These people are relentless!  It reminds me of a bad car dealership experience. 

I simply don't understand why the mall leasing agents allow these pushy owners of kiosks into the mall.  I remember when there were many kiosks and those folks wouldn't bother the shoppers.  They were kind and waited for folks WHO WERE INTERESTED in their products to stop at the stations and inquire/purchase.  And they always seemed busy.  Now we are bombarded and put in an uncomfortable position!

I wonder how the larger fixed stores feel about people avoiding those areas because the mall is letting such rude, pushy owners into the mix?  It truly cheapens the whole shopping experience.  I have watched mall attendance decline sharply over the past few years.  Painting the mall the latest fad gray and changing the flooring to gray won't fix the problem (now the mall looks cold and uninviting - what a supreme waste of money).  The problem is the kiosk owners.  I have so many friends and family members who no longer go to Scottsdale Fashion Square because of this.",1.0

"Went here as a last minute decision with my family on our stop through Las Vegas. EVERYTHING was so good! We all ordered our own dishes but then couldn't resist taking test bites of everyone else's. They cook with fresh herbs and it smells amazing!

Seared scallop appetizer is the best scallop I've ever had! 
Foi grais- not on menu but you can still order it. Was very good, I usually don't like it but I loved this one! Easy to share because you only want a couple bites
Zucchini, mushrooms, and asparagus make for great light vegetable sides
Sea bass was moist, tender, and tasty
Filet mignon- extra pricey but excellent 
Lime chicken- very tender and tasty
Lastly the chili cilantro shrimp fried rice was a very good twist on fried rice. Wasn't overly soaked with soy sauce, wonderful combination of flavors.

Overall, great experience. Portions are on the smaller side which was great so order a couple things and didn't leave feeling grossly stuffed. Very expensive but well worth it.",5.0

If you pay with credit card  or debit,  he demanded a tip... saying ""so how much can I take for my tip"" His hands was dirty and rough looking as if he just worked on a car..

"I had heard about this place from a friend and went after class for my birthday. It was kind of a quick pop in - to see what it was about - and we ended up staying. We loved the environment, the music and the windowless panel to look out to the street was pretty cool. It is a skater/hip hop/alternative restaurant and that's what I pretty much loved about it when I walked in.

We ordered several things on the menu because they're $5! But do be careful, you will end up spending a lot because everything looks so good! They're mac and cheese is to die for! So creamy and cheesy, it tastes better than homemade! The drinks are pretty cool as well, they have a wide selection but it is more on the expensive side - only downfall but I guess that is to make up for the cheap food. Overall, it is definitely somewhere you need to go!",4.0

Since it was taking a while for our appetizer to get to our table the manager actually came out and spoke with us offering us our appetizer on the house. I didn't even think that it was taking a long time considering how busy it was. The manager was extremely nice and did more than she needed to. Other than that our food was cooked perfectly and we were extremely satisfied. Overall great experience!",5.0
"I will admit, I am not a pinterest fan. I kind of think pinterest is ruining the world by homogenizing school projects everywhere and allowing people to pretend to be artistic when really they just have the internet. Regardless, the husband got me a splatter paint date (on groupon for a ridic amount of money..... over 70$) for Christmas. We went. It was fun. We splattered paint of various bright neon colors at a canvas in a cool paint covered room for a half hour or so. The end result is fairly ugly (did I mention I'm not very artistic?). We then got 'wine and cheese and chocolate' as part of the deal. The cheese 'plate' was like 4 slices of cheese from one of those costco trays.... sad showing. We each got one glass of champagne that was fine. The 'chocolate' was a fun sized hershey. No joke. Not exactly what I would expect for a '$100 value.'  I know people go gaga for this kind of thing because it is just sooooo instagram worthy, but I think it's sort of a gimmick. If you like that kind of thing, though, you would love this place and should go right away. It just wasn't for me.",3.0

"First, a disclaimer: I moved here from Southern California and my parents still live in Orange County so I probably visit them and a crawfish joint there (Boiling Crab, Claws, etc...) at least every month.

Hot N Juicy has gotten better over the years with their service.  The waiters are very attentive now and you will never experience a crisis of tongue-on-fire and an-empty-drink-in-hand.  The service is consistent and commendable.

However, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  Let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from Vietnamese people living in New Orleans, loving crawfish, Cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  The Viet crawfish craze started in Houston, jumped to Westminster, and spread nationwide.  Hot N Juicy is the Las Vegas response to a community that contains a sizable Vietnamese population.  They caught their lucky break from appearing on the Travel Channel.  But they cannot be the representative for the Vietnamese Cajun crawfish subculture.  Which brings me back to sauce: Hot N Juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  Besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  There is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something Boiling Crab & Claws in Orange County do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.

There is one thing I love here, which are the sweet potato fries, fried to perfection with the right crisp.

I'll go to Hot N Juicy if my Vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, I'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service.",3.0

I called around, some folks wanted $90 to open my vehicle, but I would say average was around $65-$75. When I called this company (I'm ashamed of myself for not getting the man and his wife's name) he said $50 and he would be here in 10-15 minutes. Deal! When he came to my apartment 10 minutes later, he called me and I met him near my vehicle. First, I'd like to say thank you for, not only the professionalism, but the conversation. This man and his wife were so polite and interesting! As a 23 year old getting a grip on reality, it's truly inspiring to speak with a man who has worked so hard his entire life with his lady right beside him.. He unlocked my 1990 GMC Suburban like a true professional and then, by my surprise, instead of asking for money and getting out of there, he asked for my keys. The man climbed in his van and made me TWO spare sets (my vehicle has separate entry and ignition keys)!!

When I told her I was going to shop around for pricing she told me that she could get me a better price by cutting down on some of the ""extras"" that she had automatically included. All of a sudden the cost was half the price. I feel like she tried to take adavantage of me because I had never worn glasses before. I took my prescription and left. Maybe a better approach would be for her to tell me what my options are along with the associated costs and let ME decide what I think is be best.",1.0

"The decision to de-fuzz my hot-pocket was an easy one... actually going through with it is a different story! Since I am now a pro at having these done on a regular basis, I thought I'd share the experience with other curious but nervous wooly mammoth Yelpers... please note this service is available for boys and girls!

The online last minute booking system is great because I can usually book my appointment the night before to avoid surprise visits from Aunt Flow if I pre-book too early (although they can still accommodate you if you still want a Brazilian during her visit *shivers*)

I am super comfortable with Julie my aesthetician, but for those not quite porn star enough to expose your caslopus to a female stranger don't worry... they are used to seeing these things day in and day out and they are pretty professional about it. 

The prices at Ten Spot aren't the cheapest. at $55 a pop, they are probably the most expensive but I think comfort both physically and emotionally are really important so in that respect it's worth it. 

Tell your aesthetician it's your first time and they will walk you through it. What makes the whole thing more enjoyable is the TV playing 30 Rock or the Office in your room, the tea they service you when you walk in and the gossip/banter you get to dish out while you are on the de-fuzzing slab.

I have always been curious about Brazilians... specifically with regards to the pain, so I was happy to hear that this location uses hard and soft wax. The soft wax is similar to what is used on a regular waxed surface. They use this on your bikini lining and outer upper areas of the hot-pocket which are less sensitive. The pain at this point is about a 6 out of 10. 

Then comes the dreaded sensitive areas of the hot-pocket! For those they use hard wax which is applied like shellac  and removed without the aid of strips once it hardens. It sticks to the hair and not the skin which makes it less painful but still a 7 out of 10.

Last but not least is the flip...  which is when you roll over and let her de-fuzz your backside. This is actually done using soft wax but only a 4 out of 10 for pain. When it's all done you'll get a chance to inspect yourself in the mirror and let your aesthetician know if they missed anything. Then off you go.

You'll be a bit tingly or sore for about 24 hours so I would recommend avoiding ""vigorous"" activities for that period... Also to avoid in-gorwns buy a bottle of TenSkin.",5.0
"The good: cheap, easy, and they let me bring my own photographer!
The bad: it's on you to make sure they get your info right, they do not run on schedule

I made an appointment for my ceremony a month in advance. The staff was very friendly on the phone, but I had to ask them to repeat everything back to me to make sure they had my information correct. When we showed up for our appointment 20 minutes early I saw that there was another couple in front of us but I didn't think anything of it considering they have multiple areas to conduct ceremonies, little did I know that they wouldn't even get to us until nearly 30 minutes after our scheduled appointment. This may not sound like a big deal, and to be honest it really isn't in the grand scheme of things, but I certainly didn't appreciate being made to wait around when I am ready to just get it over with and I know that had I been half an hour late that they would have had a problem with me. I had also brought in my own photographer whom I was paying by the hour, so a good chunk of her time was wasted just sitting around waiting to get started.",3.0
"Went to our first show last night. Let me begin by saying the talent was incredible, we did not stop laughing the entire time. Food and drinks on the other hand? The WORST. I ordered the premium Moscow Mule and it was incredibly weak and barely carbonated. It tasted as if it was watered down. My friend ordered a raspberry mojito and same story. The mint and raspberries weren't muddled and there was more soda water than necessary, making the drink flavorless. 3 in our group ordered makers mark on the rocks... Those were fine, although it's pretty difficult to screw that drink up. In addition to a cocktail I ordered a water and filtered/tap water is unavailable. You are forced to pay $4 for still Voss- no charge for ice tho HAHA what a joke... Moving on to the food: my dad ordered the gumbo, it was okay but nothing special. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and the lettuce was soggy. The chicken was cold in the center and warm toward the edges... Yuck. My friend had mozzarella sticks and we didn't expect them to be handmade but if they had actually been cooked through- not still cold in the middle-it would have been nice. Another friend had the sliders... Soggy bun, pretty disgusting. We don't expect 5 Star fine dining at an establishment such as this but at least get your timing right when throwing frozen mozzarella sticks in the oven. Bottom line: eat dinner somewhere else and bring a flask... Bar rescue didn't do much but improve aesthetics and still not much of an atmosphere at that. Thank goodness decent comedians actually perform or this place would be out of business.",2.0
"According to my Japanese relatives, the curry taste as good as instant Curry, the kind that they buy at a Japanese grocery store. Also, the Oyakodon was too sweet.

"From the outside it might well be a place to drive by, but the food is definitely worth stopping for. If you don't know what you want to order, ask the waitstaff for recommendations or bring friends who have visited before (which is what I did).

I had the eggplant from the Afghani Specialty menu with naan, and it was delicious but too much food, which was actually OK because I just boxed up the leftovers in a doggie bag (even if I had a dog, I wouldn't share). I also ordered a veggie samosa, which I had one yummy bite, exclaimed how good it was, and it was finished off in ""taste testing"" by my dinner mates. 

The naan was really useful, especially at soaking up some of the hot spices in the other dishes that my group ordered.

I'd like to try other items on the menu too, as they have a diverse assortment including gyros! Looking forward to visiting again.",4.0
"One of my favorite things to do when traveling is to check out any local record stores to see what kind of treasures I will find, so naturally, when I saw Zia Records on my way to my aunt's house, I had to stop.

Zia was not quite what I was expecting -- I had anticipated more of a ""proper"" record store, whereas Zia had more of an FYE feel to it. As in, they were stocked to the brim with DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, kitschy knick-knacks, and of course, records back in the corner. If I hadn't been pressed for time, I would have perused more of the other sections outside of the records, but records were what I came for. 

They have a nice selection of both used and new records. Organization was not their forte, as the records were very loosely (and loosely is actually a little generous) organized by letter. This was not necessarily a bad thing since this disorganization lead me to finding a nice copy of Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat in the A section, but it was a little annoying that I could not rely on some sort of organization to riffle through the records. 

All in all, it was a nice stop -- found some records to take back to Oklahoma City with me, and when I'm in Vegas next, I will definitely stop by again.",4.0
"We ended up here for a rainy semi-girls night out. This place has potential but didn't wow me for my first visit. 

The atmosphere was nice. There were mustaches lining the walls and low lighting boosted by tea candles at each table. I like that this place clearly followed the theme of the bar and still managed to provide a nice ambiance. Even though the place is pretty small, there was a good mix of tables and booths and a decent sized bar. And let's not forget the delicious smell of hookah in the air.

The best part of the night was the DJ. He kept a good mix of old school and new school blasting out and we were bopping our heads and singing all night. In my opinion, he was a huge win for this place! 

Service was...non-exsitent. Since the weather wasn't great, they weren't all that busy but somehow still managed to leave me underwhelmed with the service. I'd give them another try, maybe when it's warmer.",3.0

"I hate having to lessen my star rating for Bernard's, as I have a personal liking for the Chef. However, I cannot justify a 4 or 5 star review after my most recent experience. 
My bf, stepson and I came here on a Monday night around 7:00 PM for dinner. It was steady, I have seen it more packed, and have also been here at a slower time as well.
We were sat in the back corner, which is totally fine with me. But it seemed that our waitress kept forgetting about us because we were out of view. We watched as people who were sat after us, receive their bread, drinks, and food first. Even though we ordered first. 
Now I never had seen this woman before, and I have been here at least 8 times since the opening. She may have been new. But we waited for everything. Not an average wait time either. Like we sat with our menus closed for 8-10 minutes before she took our order. The waitress who we always see there, actually had to go point out to the newbie, ""hey your table is ready to order"". 
Then when we got dessert, it took SO LONG for it be brought out. We ordered tiramisu and cheesecake. Other than slice it, what could have possibly took so long? 
Again the place was steady, but by NO MEANS slammed. I was so annoyed watching half the restaurant get great service by our normal girl, while we drooled over others food. 
Now the food was still up to par. Beautiful presentation, and worth giving Bernard's another go. But I hope they are not on a downhill spiral. What happen to Roger, the manager making his rounds? What happen to the hostess? They traded her in for the crappy waitress with a fake smile?

"FREE CIGARS?  Yep- keep reading... but...

Don't go here...!

If you don't like smoke- don't go here.  If you have OCD and get hives when you see dust- don't go here.  If you don't like friendly old guys reliving their youth- don't go here.  If you're afraid of parallel parking- don't go here.  If you are allergic to vinyl seating surfaces- don't go here.  If you can't stand mellow classic rock (read: Led Zepplin)- don't go here.  If you're in a hurry- don't go here.  If you request 'Non-Smoking' ALL the time- don't go here.  If you are trying to become a hipster by smoking cigars- don't come here.  

Have I made my point?  But you're still reading...?  Great, then read on...

If you enjoy a good smoke, if you have a few hours to kill, if you love the idea of smoking in your own living room but hate the 'sticky-dirt' that accumulates on the walls only to be evident when you move your pictures around and find that your walls are 3 shades darker than when you first painted them, if you enjoy hearing stories that start out- 'When I was younger...' or 'When I was your age...', if you're not allergic to dust, if you have an open mind... you get the idea.  This place is a gem.

I'm a chill, relaxed, open minded, live & let live, love to hear stories, love to tell stories, love to BYO (as you can carry a 6 pack in here) kind of guy.  I was brought up in a 2 smoker household, my father quit cold turkey when I was about 12, my mother has reduced her cigarette intake drastically but still smokes daily.  I turned out ok.  No lasting effects, no long term issues.  I can't recall when I tried my first cigar and I can admit- I wasn't hooked.  I have evolved over time.  Now when I want to relax, when I want to recharge, I head to Blooms.  

Cigar Camp happens every Saturday.  What's that, you ask?  It's kind of like WDVE's Electric Lunch.  Michelle Michaels asks for 'lunch requests', she promises to 'try to get it on...' she 'Cooks it up & serves it hot'... but there's no lunch.  Here at Blooms- there's no Camp.  There's no tents, no campfire, no smores...  What there is is a very friendly owner (Mark) holding court and acting like the moderator of the debate on life.  My wife learned about Furries here, for god's sake!  She thought I was pulling her leg when I tried to explain it but after our second visit to Blooms when the old guys were discussing the upcoming weekend, she learned all she needed to know.  Cigar Camp does feed you though- there's usually ribs, corn bread, pulled pork, slaw, potato chips, all supplied by Mark (with a required purchase of course.  We all know there's No Free Lunch).  The 'campers' also bring stuff and we had our first taste of home-made Lemoncello here.    

Our first visit we learned how to get free cigars.  Years ago there was a bar in Homestead named Chiodos.  Chiodos was decorated with eclectic stuff.  Eclectic stuff and Bra's...  TONS of Bra's...  Well, I'm not sure who 'came' first- Blooms or Chiodos but Mark has bras all over the ceiling of the humidor.  I guess it keeps the cigars happy.  Anyway- we were taking the tour and my wife asked about them.  Turns out- if you give him your bra- you get a free cigar.  If you take it off in front of the 'cigar smoking court'- you get 2 cigars.  If you let him take a polaroid- 3 cigars.  My loving and open minded wife earned me 2 free cigars.  Pictures don't lie- but reviews can, she said.  ;) 

As for prices and the review that says the prices are high... Are you HIGH...?  Mark will take you to the $2 bin and tell you that this cigar is better than the $14 one 2 shelves over.  He'll tell you that the $4 ones are only half as good as the $8 ones.  He's not trying to win you over- he's telling you to think for yourself.  We're all individuals with our own tastes.  Try the $2 ones first, if you don't like them try a different one.  There's that saying that says 'You eat with your eyes first...' and those $2 cigars don't look like much but they have every bit as much taste as a $10 one with a fancy band.  Tell Mark what you want to spend and he'll pick the best cigar for your needs...  

Where am I gong with this review...?  I'm not exactly sure.  It's my very own 'trip down memory lane' that's continuously being added to, I guess.  But in the infamous words of Jimmy Buffett- 'The best navigators are not quite sure where they're going until they get there...'

However, the scenery is outstanding and the customer service has been great for me.  They also have some great craft beers on tap.  I would recommend that you sit outside on the water and get a craft beer during happy hour or reverse happy hour.  I will continue to come here because of the customer service, view/location, reverse happy hour, and quality craft beer.  It's also a nice place to play Cornhole outside.",3.0

"This place has been here for a loooooong time.  It is also only 2-1/2 miles from my house, how nice is that? The best nursery in the valley located only a few minutes away.  But, I have driven all over the valley to nurseries and also have ordered trees and plants online.  Anyway, it's the customer service here not-to-mention the vast property full of all KINDS of trees and plants that attracts me.  You walk in, someone is standing there.  They will walk the entire property with you if you so desire and they will describe anything you are interested in.  If you have a specific type of need to fill - shrubbery; shade tree; whatever, they will take you to whatever they have available.  

I went in there last week looking for a ground covering plant that I had bought at a nursery going out of business.  I didn't know the name of it, the guy offered suggestions but, walking 40 feet into the place I saw a whole stand full of them sitting there.  Yes, I was elated to find them that easily (neighborhood cats had trampled a section of them and I wanted to replace them).  

It's also Christmastime and they have a HUGE variety of Christmas trees!  If you have a 20 foot tall ceiling in your home, you will find a tree here that is absolutely beautiful that will take advantage of that space!  Their cheapest price is $29 - which is nice for a tree that is sitting in a stand with water versus all those other big box places that have them all clumped together, NOT sitting in water, death defined.  

Oh, and their delivery fee is $50. I was told that is wherever, though I suppose that rate might go up for a longer distance, I don't really know.  I've been to the other nurseries, alot of them, even the obscure ones that are not that well known.  Moon Valley has nothing on Whitfill's besides they do the planting.  Their selection is nothing like Whitfill's IMO.  If you are a plant/tree enthusiast, you have to at least try coming to this place once to see what they have to offer.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I came here for the taiwanese food (he's taiwanese) but left a little bit disappointed. We ordered an oyster omelette, a taiwanese tempura and a stone bowl beef noodle soup to share. The portions were generous but the flavour weren't authentic... 

The taiwanese tempura tasted like the frozen ones you can buy at the supermarket for your hotpot and the sauce that came with it tasted like a typical sweet sauce you'd find at any Chinese buffet. The oyster omelette on the other had had too much egg to it: a good oyster omelette should be composed in a large part of a starch/water doughy mix with some bits of eggs and oysters but this one tasted just like an omelette with oysters and some pieces of starch on the sides. The was nothing special about the noodle soup, the soup didn't stand out, the noodles were a bit over cooked to my liking and there was piece of boiled romain lettuce which I find very odd. 

I must say we left quite disappointed and will likely not return.",1.0
"More like 3.5 stars. The location is in deep North Las Vegas (non-yuppie chow town) so put into consideration what time would be best not to get shot and what not...so, I'd say before 2pm. Went here last night and it's a good thing football was on TV so everyone's at home.

Their menu is pretty busy. They have burgers, fries, sammies, Greek salad, Mexican food, etc. They have combos in secret code and you probably have to be a regular to know what those codes are. I had a few bites of their pastrami burger and chili cheese fries, and an horchata. I might say the burger was pretty tasty and the party wasn't dry. The lettuce they put on the burger was green and fresh (way better than wilted fast food chain lettuce). Their pastrami is what I call ""beginners pastrami"" which is great for non-pastrami lovers like me. It tastes milder than the average pastrami.

This is a no none sense type of place. You pick what you want, go up to the counter to place your order - if you ask questions they roll their eyes at you, take a number and have a seat, they bring your food to your table, you eat and you leave.

I kind of wish I would have thought of something in particular to look for before heading in; i.e. Tiffany style lamps, watches, etc.  But nonetheless, it was a blast looking at all of the displays.  Prices ran the gamut from really reasonable to really outrageous.  I saw a vintage 100% cashmere car coat with a faux fur collar in impeccable shape for around $30 (easily could have sold on eBay for twice that amount or more), but also a pair of fairly beat-up cowboy boots for over $150.00.

"I am a long time BMW driver (we currently have a 650 vert and an X5M).  I've never really been around anyone that had a Porsche so my knowledge of the brand was quite limited but I have always been intrigued by them.   I took some time a few weeks back to visit Hendrick Porsche after a service visit for my bimmer and had the opportunity to meet with Bryan Armbruster, one of the sales associates.

I explained to Bryan that I still had just under a year remaining on my lease but wanted to learn more about Porsche and the various models.   Even though he knew he wasn't making a sale that day, Bryan spent well over an hour with me to introduce me to the brand, show me all of the models and even test drive two different cars.

Being new to Porsche I know that it will take several visits to really dial in which vehicle and options that I will want.   Since my visit, Bryan has been very responsive in answering all of the questions that I have been sending his way.

I'm not sure when I will actually pull the trigger, but when I do, I can assure you that I will be buying my first Porsche from Bryan.",5.0
I have been here 4x I have three shitzu and from the first visit my experience was awesome. We do not take our dogs anywhere else. They are so comforting during stressful procedures. I had my female shitzu give birth to her 4 pups here. She was in distress because her pup was stuck in her uterus. It was about 6 hours before she birthed all of her puppies. The overnight Doctor say with us and talked about all different kinds of forms of payment. Due to money being tight we were worried that this would hit us hard. But we were able to put down and pay in installments for this procedure. I also took one of moms pups here as well as took dad today he had nails that were imbedded in his padding of his foot. They did amazing and it was not expensive for everything they did. I refuse to go to any other place. They work with you and are amazing people. I recommend this place to everyone. Though the prices are a little high at times depending on what is needed it is well worth it because of the care.  Thank you 1st pet NV for always being amazing.,5.0
"Our tour guide was great and had a lot of fun, interesting information to share. I was entertained the whole time and learned a lot about the city. 

I would recommend this tour to both visitors and Pittsburgh natives - my family is a mix of both and everyone enjoyed it. 

My only complaint is that the seats are unbelievably uncomfortable. They curve inward so you are forced into bad posture if you want to relax. 

If you have back problems I would come prepared with a back pillow for lumbar support. 2 hours is a long time to have so much pressure on your lower back.",4.0

"Wow, with all of the horrible reviews this will certainly stick out.  Fact is, if I hadn't reached Aaron, the the call center, this Definitely would be yet another scathing review.
I had asked for the new upgraded water coolers, 4 times in 6 months.  They were either out of them, or was told one would be delivered to me, than was not.  Even with an online request for a skipped delivery, our driver left 4 bottles of water for us, and still no new cooler.
Pissed, I called Sparkletts 800, expecting to get nowhere.  Yes, you are on hold for a Long time, which sucks, BUT, than Aaron answered.  
Within 25 minutes he had a definitive date in which my new bottom load, hot and cold water tank would be delivered, credited me for the 6 bottles, suspended my deliveries for 2 months, (Upon my request), fixed all of the information on their website about me, and got me my Costco membership pricing, saving me allot.  
Aaron was Very knowledgeable, didn't give me a bunch of stupid excuses, and I never heard, ""I don't know if I can do that.""  He was friendly, took his time, and got me straightened out.  I've been with Sparkletts for a long time, so I didn't Really want to change, but I was really pissed, so I Crystal Geysers phone number ready.

"I really can't get enough of this place.  For anyone who understands true Italian food, this is a must try.  I always enjoy their fish.  Perfectly prepared and always served up with delicious vegetables.  In my opinion, this place is a bargain given the entrees are all in the $20-30 range.  Pasta is even less than that.  They also have a decent Italian wine offering with most glasses in the $8-10 range and bottles below $40.  I've always found the food fresh, the service pleasant and the atmosphere lively.

Finally got around to stopping by for breakfast with my boy. A bit of confusion getting a table at first but finally got to sit down.

I had the huevos rancheros which where pretty good. Link sausage were big and tasty. My son had some sides but the hash browns were a little under cooked. Juice could have been a bit colder too.

"2nd time at Cathouse, and all I can say is Yaaaaah!.   Me and My wife came back to celebrate our 1 year anniversary, since we came here on our honeymoon last year and had a great time.  This time we had even better time, and without spending as much as last time.

Right from the beginning, our host, Alex Duncan picked us out of the line and noticed we were married and asked us if we'd be interested in table service with a drink minimum, I already knew we weren't going to stay at the minimum, so we were like 'sure'.  The host sat us in a great spot that felt very exclusive, we had our own waitress and the music was great.

"I needed to get my car inspected and since this business is the closest location to my house that offers such a service, I decided to try them out so I made an appointment online for a State Inspection today at 4pm. The appointment setter online asked me for my car's make and model as well as the service needed before presenting me with a calendar highlighting the available appointment times. After reviewing all the days and times available, I went ahead and set up my appointment and received text confirmation a couple of minutes later. When I showed up at 4pm for my appointment, the guy at the desk very unapologetically said that they do not offer State Inspections on the weekends. I told him that they should address their website's appointment setter because it should not have allowed me to make an appointment for an inspection at a time when they don't offer it. He just said that he has nothing to do with that... The whole thing was a complete waste of my time and I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future.",1.0

Frustrated, I left and returned a different day expecting different service. Instead, I wasn't greeted at all, and sat in the store for 10 minutes without anyone so much as acknowledging me.

"Can't say it's good for anybody not to have proper meals throughout the day.  I should listen to myself.  When I didn't however, I craved Japanese cuisine.  Who in the world is open at midnight?  Lots of places in Chinatown.  Except I was lazy to drive out further.  

Surprisingly not too far away, Sen of Japan is open til 1:30am!  Whaaaat... Yeah let's go!  Omgosh look - its across MadHouse Coffee.  Could be a great thing... :D

Happy hour menu til 1:30 too???!  I like these kinda surprises!  What's to order:
- Baked Escolar is baked super white tuna w/jalapeno pesto sauce topped w/pumpkin tempura red pepper corn.  This is superb!  One of the fancier items on their HH menu.  It's small but powered with flavor!
- Cut sushi rolls like Spicy scallop, Alaska roll topped w/seared salmon, and freshwater eel.  Okay maybe you have to have a thing for these choices.  The flavor was a little different than just simple nigiri sushi.  But suggesting to at least try em out.  Eel was my fave.
- No.1 spicy albacore top tuna was something we ordered first, but it came out second to last.  Irony? Yes and it was just okay.  Not number one for me.  They didn't save the best for last... It was different.  I would've preferred plain unfancy nigiri for both the albacore and tuna separately.
- Salmon carpaccio was the absolute last served to our table.  And this hit homerun for my taste buds.  This definitely I would order again!

The interior is really clean and proper as you would expect a typical Japanese restaurant to appear.  Check out their sake collection!  Huge sake bottles lining a countertop and stored in their ref.  Nice ambience and cool music, though not traditional music.  

Service was pretty professional for a late night meal.  So impressed with how the dishes were explained by the young man; even how he hand gestured to point palm up and detail the ingredients.  Wait...was he the chef?!",5.0
"I really don't understand all the bad reviews for this place. I always thought it was more of a sit down fine dining type place til my wife finally took me over the Christmas break.

You place your order at the counter and then everything is brought to you in lightning speed.

I ordered the Shawarma dinner and we had a bunch of dips for the pita. The dips were great though I felt the tabouli was too minty for my liking. The shawarma dinner was good, but not the best I've ever had.

Overall I would definitely go back and try some other items on the menu as it is a really cool concept and the food was decent. I feel like there is something in the menu that I will really love and with the fantastic service and nice environment it is a relaxing dining experience.",4.0

They also sent us a sympathy card with a small story inside that helps explain to children where pets go when they die.

"I had never been in the ABC tavern before it was redone.  But I love this new not-so-dark and dank interior.  They have a good beer selection (although to be honest I usually stick with the cheap wimpy beers such as PBR or Miller Lite).  
The food, though, is a step up above normal dive food.  With all their ingredients coming from the Westside market, they have some pretty solid food items.  The pork belly sandwich contains thick cuts of crispy bacon and comes with thin delicious fries. 
My friends and I shared an atomic dog.  A huge jumbo hot dog stuffed with jalepenos and then wrapped in bacon.  Wow.  It was ridiculously good but there was no way I could have eaten the whole thing without a guilt trip following.
The decor is bordering on dive but is still very comfortable and well-lit.  The music comes from Pandora and has varied from 80's ballads to 90's pop rock the times I have been there.  The clientele is nice, if not bordering on too nice as we had more than one person feel it was appropriate join in our conversation without being asked.

I got the ham and cheese sandwich. It was really simple but actually pretty good. My friend's meal on the other hand...not so much.  She wasn't very happy with the portion or the taste.  My other friend was equally as dissatisfied with her meal.  If we ever go back, it'll definitely be after a late night of partying when we won't care as much.",3.0

I went back for a repeat and it was a nightmare. I ordered the pork shoulder and sprouts again. I was advised since it was Sunday, I could only order potato chips as a side with the pork shoulder!?  Random, but I agreed. Our meal came and I was served a pork sandwich with crumbs of potato chips. It was ONLY AFTER the food arrived the server told me the shoulder wasn't avail and no longer on the menu.  She said it's ""been removed from the menu,  so I shouldn't have ordered it.""  She offered to remove the pork from the bill. Didn't offer anything else.  I said, ""I'm gonna need a menu since I came for lunch and my husband is eating.""  5 mins later she brings a menu. I pick something else and I waited 25 more minutes for mediocre, cold shrimp and grits. My husband finished his meal before my second meal arrived. We were charged for all of it.

It was apparent he had no idea about the menu. I asked for extra pink sauce and he mumbled something to himself, I tried to explain what I meant and he told me that he would figure it out. This dude was either stoned to the bone or brand new although I don't think it was the latter. The teppanyaki here is good. Otherwise I would never put up with this kind of service.  I can't speak about the sushi as I haven't had it.  Bar tender is a good dude, chefs do a good job. 

Edit: So I wrote that review while I waited on my order. Steak is wayyy over cooked (I ordered rare) it came medium well. Meal came with 3 shrimp.

"This gym has become my mecca of fitness the past couple of months. The gym has lots of equipment and usually there is little to no wait on the equipment. Unfortunately, the previous gym I was a member of (Lifetime Fitness) spoiled me, so I cannot rightly give a five star review, especially because at LVAC all the machines are crammed in together, often with little space to maneuver. Considering that the monthly membership is half that of my previous gym, I think the value is well worth the price.

Laura did such a great job of describing the gym that there is little else to mention. Though if you are like me and go straight from the gym to work in the morning, be warned that the showers in the men's locker room are just open stalls.

We ordered the cactus of the valley and the king's crown, while the first one was overwhelmingly huge, the latter was of a modest size (yes, I'm a big nacho eater). The cactus of the valley unfortunately had a little too much spice for all of us: we had to tone down the level of spicy with large amounts of water and sour cream (flagging down for more water was also a pain since there was only one waitress for all of the back). The salsa in both nachos was a bit too liquid, making most of the nachos in the centre soggy (especially in the king's crown, maybe also because it was all stacked up on top of each other?).

I had the guy making my pita ask me FOUR times what type of meat I wanted ( I was the only customer in the store) and I kept saying black bean veggie and to not cross-contaminate. Well then another customer comes in the store and he *accidently* gets some of their meat in my patty area, and also uses the same knife and spatula even though I kindly asked to use different ones. The pitas I get always fall apart and are a mess, the bread is always dry and they don't cover the vegetables.

"Came here on a weekday for a light dinner/snack. It was slightly busy, but we were still able to sit down. 

What I liked:

- The food. It was very good. We had the cilantro shrimp salad (I didn't expect it to knock my socks off, but it did), grilled squid (also quite good), and sashimi plate (the fish was cold and fresh, just the way it should be)

- The service. We weren't over or under served. Our server was friendly and helpful. Waiting time was reasonable. 

- Ambiance. It was super cozy and relaxed. 

What I didn't like:

- The selection. I found the selection limited because it was only one page of tapas, and not enough enticing options (for me, at least). I picked a few things and was happy with them, but there was nothing I felt I just had to get. If we picked a fourth option, I would have struggled to find something I wanted. This isn't a problem I usually have at Izakayas.

 - Prices. I didn't pay, but I did see the prices on the menu. I know tapas are not cheap, but I thought it was a bit ridiculous to pay $19 for a sashimi platter, which had 9 pieces of fish. It wasn't even butterfish or tuna belly, it was your regular standard fare (i.e. salmon).

Bottom Line: Great place for a date. Very relaxed/cozy ambiance makes for a comfortable environment to get to know someone. Don't come here if you're picky or very hungry.",4.0

"It's been a couple years since I've been to any Ajisen Ramen. I came for dinner tonight, and they were full at 7:30pm. We waited for a few minutes for our table, but I don't have a problem with that. I was quite surprised that their menu is considerably larger than it was before. I quite like that. The prices are around 9-12 dollars per bowl of ramen.

I had the BBQ pork ramen ($9.50). It had 6 slices of pork. The pork wasn't dry, but it wasn't melting in my mouth either. The egg wasn't soft-boiled, but it wasn't disturbingly dry. There were some bean sprouts and some shreds of black fungus. There was also a sprinkling of green onion. The soup base was a tad salty. The noodles had a nice chew to them. The food came out quickly. It wasn't super piping hot, but it was hot enough. I was in and out in less than an hour. 

My friend had the teppanyaki steak ramen ($11.99?). She said the steak was juicy and tender and delicious. It smelled pretty good. Oddly enough though, the steak and the bowl of ramen did not come out at the same time. She said this is normal (I'm assuming she would know, because this is her regular). 

Thing to note for next time: Their black sesame ice cream is $1.99. That's super cheap. I don't know if the portion is small or the sesame ice cream is now of a cheap quality, but if they're using the same kind as they were three years ago, this is a really good deal. I had black sesame ice cream for the first time in my life here many years ago, and I'd have to say that this black sesame ice cream was the darkest colored black sesame ice cream that I've ever had, and that's a good thing.

We have the car back already, and they seemed to have done a good job.  It was really very minor, but in repairing the rear bumper they had to remove it and so also were able to verify that the structure underneath was not damaged.

I came here because my insurance prefers them, but I would come here anyway.  The only other shop I've found that I like is T&S, who also do a great job.  Chandler is a bit closer to us, though, and as good as T&S.",4.0
"So I do try and hit up Indian places when I'm craving the food so I went here because my fiancé's grandfather was talking about this place and said it was very good lol So we convinced his mom to take a trip here and have Indian for the first time. 

The place is very big but it's also connected with a Chinese food place next door so it's a bit confusing when you walk in. But I did like the overall atmosphere of the place. Nice and relaxing, looked really clean too. The bathrooms were immaculate too lol We were literally the only people in there at this time so I can tell ya the service was fast haha 

I ordered the chicken tikka masala because I'm a coward and always order that when I want Indian food haha. I also had naan bread and we ordered two appetizers. My usual- vegetable samosa and something different this time. I can't remember the name of it but it was a fried patty type hash brown thing that had spinach and potato inside it and it was really good! You'll see it on the menu under appetizers - you can't miss it. Just read the description. 

My only complaint- I asked for mild sauce (I know I'm a wimp) but the sauce was pretty hot actually. I'd say it was more on the medium side. I still ate it but I just hate chugging my water or soda after every bite. I like to enjoy the taste of my food- not burn my tongue.  But overall- it was delicious! And we had tons of left overs haha",4.0

No complaints about service and it is a cute restaurant, but the food quality is poor.

"Noticed this on the way home from 168 Market, located down North and across the street. Place was decorated with native style furniture and bamboo accents. Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees. They got a good selection of tradtional Filipino eats and fairly priced combos/to go containers..

Sinigang na pork (soup/stew with vegetables and pork):  Good amount of pork with just the right amount of sour and salty broth flavor that's so heart-warming!

Caldereta (beef stew based on tomato sauce): Tender and Tasty pieces of Beef with its Succulent sauce makes for a Very Successful rendition of this dish! 

Beef Steak (stir fried / boiled beef slices and onions): Explosive Flavors of garlic, lemon/ycitrusy sweet and soy sauce infused within the thin fall apart beef slices and sauteed onions. Extremely Tasty!

Crispy Pata (deep fried pig): How could this not taste good.. Crunchy, Chewy and Porky! Dip it in the soy/vinegar sauce and Enjoy!

"3.5 stars, Montana deserves more credit!
As a previous reviewer mentioned, there does not seem to be much of an association with the chain Montana's. 
The selection at the bar is pretty good and while the menu is standard American fare, it tastes right and is prepared fairly quickly. 
There is a dance/event space on the second floor, and although I have heard good things, I have not been there.

In brief, from the selection of bar/restaurants with Patio on the over-rated Richmond strip, Montana is a cut above the rest.",3.0

"I really wanted to like this place because I love Caribbean food. It is a charming hole-in-the-wall spot and the folks who served me were super kind. I love little restaurants and always want to support them, and hey, maybe you will love it here! Clearly a lot of people do! But let me explain why I won't be going back. 

Price: $20 for a little drink and lunch seemed a bit ridiculous to me, especially for the quality. The helpings of food were decent but I honestly cannot finish it, nor do I think I'll be able to. I took a shower before eating here, and after trying to finish the food (but not being able to) I feel grease and oil seeping out of my pores. I took the leftovers home and was thinking I might be able to try to finish it by adding some raw greens & plain rice but honestly I need to throw it away, like $16 of food which is a huge fucking bummer because I am not a rich person and when I go out to eat I want it to count! My big criticism is the food is just so fucking OILY/GREASY!! I absolutely cannot eat it!!! If you are a junk food vegan and your main food groups/taste buds are oil/fat/salt/sugar, you may really love this place and find it to be just the comfort food that you need and want. I love decadent comfort food too, but really cannot stand stuff that is heavy on the oil/fat/grease. It makes me feel super, super sick but hey maybe you have a stomach of steel and are super into it.

It is probably the worst vegan mac I have ever had. If you're looking for a decent vegan mac and cheese, try Hogtown Vegan. For excellent light, non-oily non-greasy Caribbean vegan food go to One Love.",1.0

"Traveled to Phoenix with my boyfriend and our hotel did not have complimentary breakfast, so we found this little gem on Yelp! It's a small space, but offers the rustic, unfinished, hipster vibe we all crave when looking for a great coffee spot. 

We both ordered a 12 oz hot latte and the tomato, avocado and egg breakfast sandwich. The latte had a great, smooth espresso flavor and the sandwiches were HUGE and so tasty!!

"Good selection of pasta salads. Love love love the tarragon tuna and broccoli with bacon. It was light on the bacon, but if you remember to think outside the box, you can walk over to the hot foods (hot potato bar) to sprinkle some fresh bacon bits into the broccoli salad. Nice spread of other salad fixings.

I was impressed that I was stopped from re-using my plate. Here I thought, I'm just getting the same salads on my 2nd round, why waste water (save them from washing another plate. One of the staff suggested I get a fresh plate. When I said I was ok reusing my plate, he nicely advised that for health and sanitary reasons (to prevent accidental contamination), it would be best if I used s fresh plate. It never occurred that could happen. You learn something new everyday. I was glad he stopped me, glad he was conscientious of what clientele might do without realizing potential missteps.

"One of the many Vegas restaurants that can totally add some spice to your night life. With so many options to choose from, I would still say the boiler room is one to visit.

Food wise: the appetizers were great and the drinks were decent.  My girlfriend went with an interesting drink that came with a smoked skull head. It added to its favor and it's a must try. I wish I knew its name. (Drunk Vegas nights cause forgetfulness)

Ambience wise: it was nicely set up. Definitely a 5 star restaurant feel.

Service: the waiter was knowledgeable with the menu and was quick to get our order to us.

Price: standard Vegas prices. I can't complain.

"I love the wine selection here, and the owner Bethany is such a doll!  There are so many wine flights to choose from, just pick the toe of wine you're in the mood for and go for it. Ive had the Gouda cheese board and it was very well put together. It came with the cheese ( of course), raspberries, crunchy bread, pickles veggies (which were very unique), and this house made chocolate/fudge(really gives you a rush of endorphins). 

Unfortunately it's hard to tell when this place is actually open. One night I went with friends, and they were closing to the public early so we had to leave. Another night I wanted to bring my hubby for the amazing wine, and we discovered they were closed when we got there, and then two other times I wanted to go and didn't know they were closed until we got there. Its almost like they should post a calendar outside so you'll know when they're open. It was really disappointing and pushes me not to select this place even though the wine is so good, because how disappointing would it be to make plans to go here only to find they are closed to the public when you get there?  At least i know they are great for private events lol, maybe.",2.0
This is a great place to stay if you're looking to be on the the Fremont Experience. I was staying her in the second week in November for a week. Easy check in and check out. They have a unique elevator button system. I stayed on the 6th floor facing the the Fremont Experience and it was a bit noisy but not as bad as I thought it would be. No fridge or microwave in my room - I stayed in a double full. Everything in the room was clean and looked fairly new. There is a McDonalds downstairs right when you enter through the Fremont Experience side. The casino is always playing good music and is moderately busy at most hours while I was staying there. For the most part I would stay here again if wanting to stay in DTLV.,4.0

"I took my car here because it was overheating.  I paid $45 for a coolant pressure test to see where the problem was and left my car overnight so they could have time to work on it the following day.  They called the following morning to let me know that the top radiator hose had ruptured, and the bottom needed to be replaced, along with the thermostat (from the car overheating.)  They quoted me $595!!!!!!!! Both radiator hoses for my vehicle run LESS THAN $20 each and the thermostat is around $30.  I called about 5 other auto mechanics, one of which is a specialist in my car, and was told that their quote was absolutely absurd.  I was told by EVERY other mechanic that I called that the labor to replace both hoses and the thermostat is less than 2 hours.  Every other mechanic I talked to also quoted me at less than $300 (less than $250 at some) to do the exact same work.  I have no idea what they are thinking here but I would not take my car here.  The only nice thing I can say is that they were very nice upon my initial arrival and also gave me a ride home so i wouldn't have to sit and wait on my husband to get off work.  I don't know if they quoted me this price because I am a young blonde female or because they just over quote everybody by double what the cost should actually be.  On a side note, I am changing the radiator hose myself today for $15.00 (the cost of the hose) and all I need is a screwdriver.  I might look like a dumb blonde but I know how to replace a rubber hose for less than $600.",1.0
"Everybody online recommended this place for great kosher food in Vegas. Unfortunately i dont think people know what good food is. The decor is very modern and nice. The ambiance is very nice. The waiter was very nice. But the food was just ehh. We started off with the drunken avocado empanadas... these were so overhyped. They were bland in flavor. Like they were missing something. Our food took a while to come since there was only 1 waiter on duty and decent amount of customers. He gave a free sangria for the wait. The sangria tasted like shit. I know and love good sangria but this was horrible. For our entrees, im a pescetarian and i wanted to order the fish tacos, but i saw another yelpers pic/complaint of them and i am glad i didnt. I instead got grilled salmon over israeli salad. My bf got the angus beef shish. My salad was decent. There was a bed of chopped romaine lettuce on my plate which was weird and random. I mixed it in with the israeli salad. My fish was OK. Once i got to the thicker part of the salmon, it wasnt cooked all the way through. So it was like clear and watery which grossed me out. My bf liked the spanish rice that came with his meal. He got 2 shish skewers and 1 skewer was literally ALL pieces of fat. No meat on there at all.

"Thievery & corruption at its finest!  It was my birthday and the band RED was playing. I purchased a bowling lane so that my party could have a place to chill and watch the band.  The price of a lane for this show was $327 plus the price of all the tickets, equaling a total cost of nearly $500.  So once the band started, the sound was so bad that nobody could hear the vocals and this continued for about 7 songs.  Keep in mind there were less than 100 people at this show, and we were the only people that purchased any sort of ""vip"" table.  So after a good 30-40 minutes my friend and I walked over to the sound booth and told the sound guy that the vocals couldn't be heard.  His response was ""get the fuck out of here"".  Not exactly the response I expected but ok, this is Las Vegas after all lol.  My friend and I continued to hang out on the floor watching the band and a few minutes later we walked back to our table and while on our way, got cut off by security.  If you can believe this... They kicked us out!!  They kicked us out for talking to the sound guy.  Just to make this very clear, neither of us were drunk.  We had a few drinks but were in no way belligerent.  The whole time they were kicking us out we were calm and respectful.  I tried speaking to the manager but he kept his back towards me and wouldn't acknowledge me.  Security wouldn't let us go back to our table to get our belongings, they wouldn't even escort me back to get our belongings.  Had I not had a few friends still at the table, Brooklyn Bowl would have kept our belongings and not given them back.  We also had money left on a pre-purchased bar tab that was stolen from us and not refunded.  Now heres the best part.... One of the security guards was actually on our side and told everyone that he thought it was weird that the vocals couldn't be heard.  He also said we were the only people who purchased a table and it was clear that he didn't like what was happening to us.  Now, I don't expect someone to do what I suggest when it comes to a bands production.  I'm not there to step on toes, I'm just there to have a good time wanting to here the vocalist.  As someone who has been in bands my whole life, there's nothing worse than playing a live show and finding out after you played that nobody could hear you.  So as you can expect, none of us will ever attend another event or anything at Brooklyn Bowl.  To be treated this way is absolutely insane!  If the venue or sound guy felt that we were out of line, then security and management should have talked to us like adults and asked us to go back to our table and enjoy the rest of the show.  Had I known that speaking to the sound guy was cause for ejection, than I would have stayed the heck away lol.",1.0

"Really disappointed with my visit. Was very excited to try this place after recommendations and seeing posts on social media. However, definitely not worth the money!! 
I paid $15 for a large bowl (the size of my fist), which was not much bigger than the small bowl, and they wrote my order down but still messed it up completely. 

Firstly I wanted the tuna, but they ran out of tuna...so settled for the salmon. 
I asked for the main sauce to be ponzu and a little bit of spicy mayo but saw them prepping salmon that was smothered in mayo and I asked if that one was mine because I asked for ponzu as main. Looking down at the post-it, realized that they messed it up. They were about to offer to re-do it but they didn't even have enough salmon left for one more order. So I just said it was fine.  They continued to top my order (with the tiniest portions each...) and put it up when finished, but I noticed it's missing something. 
They completely forgot to put one topping altogether.  

Just a pretty terrible experience altogether.

"One thing I don't love about this place is that it draws so many that it can be hard to find a seat on more popular nights! 

The atmosphere is fun, comfortable and uptown casual. The lighting effects and decor finishes are trendy and well thought out. The outdoor patio area, even though right alongside the parking lot, is equally inviting. Being heated and partitioned off with heavy curtains makes it usable even during winter months. It does draw a lot of smokers which makes it nearly impossible to be enjoyed by non smokers. Even sitting close to the door that the servers use can be bothersome as the smoke is pulled in with every opening of the door. 

The martinis are poured table side and each come with a sidecar which make them quite generous for their price points of $8-$12. There is a large wine and beer selection also. The menu has several sharing appetizer options for snacking while socializing. I've tried several of them from dips to pizzas and they've been tasty. I choose to come here though more for the drinks and atmosphere. There's also a smaller, but adequate dinner menu. I have not tried any of these dishes to comment on the quality, but they sound worth a try. The pricing is pretty much spot on comparatively. 

Depending on the night, it can get sometimes rowdy and loud with a younger crowd. I prefer weeknights for this reason.  This is definitely a popular location for all types of social gatherings though. Great job Billy's!",3.0

"We met Mark from Patterson Remodeling when we were picking out tile for our house at Floor & Decor.  We wanted to tile most of our house, new countertops in the kitchen and carpeting in the bedrooms.  Mark gave us a quote for our tile project which was very competitive with other bids we received.  We choose him because of his estimate to get the project done in a timely manner.  Mark was very professional and had his team at our home on time and the project was completed as promised.  We ran into some plumbing issues in the bathroom when the toilet was re-installed after the tile was laid and Mark arranged for a plumber to come and fix it.  We just had the countertops put in and they look great!  Mark even got us a discount on the quartz we picked out.  After the project was done we contacted Mark with a problem we were having with our hot water heater and he again put us in contact with a plumber.  He definitely went above and beyond by helping us even after the project was completed.  Mark was wonderful to work with and delivered on everything we wanted at a reasonable cost.  You hear so many negative things about other remodeling projects and contractors, but that was not our experience.  Mark is a great guy to work with and I would give Patterson Remodeling a big ""thumbs up"".",5.0

I really enjoyed the chicken fried rice, which had shredded chicken instead of chunks of chicken.  The Dan Dan Noodles came hot or cold, my choice was hot.  I asked it to be extra spicy and they hit the target right on.  Mmmm....delicious.  While I don't generally feel comfortable choosing from Dim Sum carts (I usually let my friends do the picking, and I do the eating), I was the one who chose from the cart.  Not a bad choice, which leads me to believe that I am either very lucky (doubtful, given my track record at the casino) or everything on the cart is good.  I kind of find it funny that they put the ""First"" Dim Sum carts at The Shops at Summerlin on their menu.  Uh...it's the only Dim Sum cart at the mall.  Not that it changes things, but they are also the tastiest Dim Sum carts at Summerlin.

Every coffee shop should have a drive thru for us poor sleep-deprived mamas. It's different in that they don't have a menu posted and they come up to your car to take your order. I decided to try their ice brewed coffee and it is so smooth. No burnt, sour or acidic taste. I asked the barista to add some cream and agave for me, with no other direction and it was perfect - not overly sweet like most places. 

I also ordered a cranberry-pecan scone because baked goods and coffee are meant to be consumed together. Uhm. The scone is bigger than my hand. Not that I have big hands, but still. It is a little on the drier side, but delicious! And as an added bonus, since it's my first visit, they bought my scone for me! Whaaaaat.

And our waitress was rude and didn't check on us once until it was time to pay. She didn't ask if we wanted refills or a box for the 3$ beans and rice we got.,4.0
"Bonsai's sushi isn't the best I've had. It's certainly not the worst though. This little corner of 7th street market seems to serve decent sushi at a decent price.

Some of the rolls are more imaginative than others such as some sort of roll with mango and shrimp tempura. The guy making my sushi was super nice and when he noticed that I wanted to go find join my friends at the table offered to send it to me once it's finished if I wanted to sit down!

Ultimately the problem lies in the rolls they have on offer. They're forgettable sadly enough. The quality is okay, the price is okay, the creativity is okay and so this place gets rated as an okay place.",3.0
"I used to go here ALL the time to get my arrangements. Not sure if they changed management or if the manager wasn't there during the times I was there.
Anyways, I was there today (MOTHERS DAY) and I asked how much the roses cost and some lady yells from behind the counter it was $6 per rose.... If you're the least bit interested in your reputation or making sales, look a bit more interested or polite. Then when I was ready to purchase the roses (with the roses in hand that I got out of the fridge myself) she AGAIN, standing there staring at me, till I said I'm ready to buy... She was enjoying her friggen massage by a coworker moaning, as I am waiting for her response. Luckily I understood, her colleague In her language was telling her that there was a customer in front of her... Then she blurted out rudely ""baby's breath?"" Not even ""would you like to add baby's breath for $2.00?"" Flat out rude. Still continued with her massage as others
Too were waiting to be helped. I get it Mother's Day is one of the busiest days... But still. Doesn't mean that you need to be rude to your customers paying or not. Let alone get a massage while a customer is talking to you.... Will NEVER EVER go back..",2.0
"Went to Pure this past Saturday, I had a really good time!  I was in a dancy mood but not in the mood to be a sardine so we kind of wandered all around the whole night with a mix of dancing and just mingling with people we met.

Our Group: 
4 girls.  My one friend was flying in around midnight but not a problem for me to go outside and grab her.

Getting In:  
We were staying at the hotel so I asked to be put on the guest list.  I have no idea if that made a difference.  Got there right before 11.  Asked the closest bouncer the deal with the guest list and he told me about the crazy VIP crowd area.   Luckily after we made our way over there another female employee got us out and we were on the girls only line.  Probably there for maybe like 2 minutes.  Total time less than 10 minutes.  No cover.  Being stamped I got my friend in quickly when she arrived (by that time there was no more girls only line).

Atmosphere:
Very cool that everyone else has described.  I totally agree that if it weren't so hyped up it would be beautiful but not as a big deal as some of the other clubs.  I really liked the fact there were multiple areas if you are in that kind of room.  LOVED the patio upstairs.  Red Room was cool, I think it was open in the beginning of the night (best place to get drinks fast) and then closed off.

Staff: 
Bouncers were friendlier to us than average.   Total play on looks though, some girl was in front of the first bouncer waving in his face.  I was right behind her, he totally ignores her pushes her aside and asks me how he can help me.  Bouncers inside introduced us to tables of guys in addition to meeting guys normally.  I will be forever grateful to the introduction of the cute Irish guys in the side room off of the Red Room because of the private bathroom.  That thing was clutch!

Drinks:
As expensive as other clubs

For the Single Ladies:
We met so many groups of guys, it was great to just rotate among them when we were in the mood to wander to a different room.   Some of the booths (in particular the ones on the deck) had older creepy guys but we cleared away.  Other than that, typical bachelor parties and other VIP groups.  Definitely expect to get groped on the dance floor in the main room (or at least a drink spilled on you)

Dancing:
Loved the different music in the different rooms.  Main room is crowded for sure.   Red Room and Main Room Top 40/Hip Hop, upstairs more house

VIP: 
 We were in VIP in all areas and they were all great.  I really liked the Red Room and that little room off to the side of the Red Room the most because we wanted to be more low key. Interesting that you get stamped for a certain area and then a different stamp for another (more enforced upstairs from my experience).  

Overall Experience/Crowd:
Everyone is right that the majority of real estate is VIP so I don't think we would have liked it as much if we didn't have access to it.    Also, someone commented about this but this at The Bank the following day had a different vibe than past nights in Vegas. It seemed more touristy, the people who were watching E! or something and had to be there to witness which celeb was going to be there.  Maybe that's just how clubs are changing now.  Either way I would highly suggest VIP and coming here to experience it!!!!",4.0
"I come here almost every weekend with my family.  The staff used to be friendlier and the service level has been in steady decline the last few months.  Is the coffee good?  Yes. Is the food good?  Yes.  But if you want to feel like a valued customer, consider going elsewhere.",3.0
"I have no idea if there food is any good, I walked all over the restaurant to find a table! All tables are first come first serve, there was 3 or 4 4-top tables with one guy sitting at them. All of the 6 or 8 tops only had 3 people sitting there. The waitresses wouldn't even speak to us. When I did speak to one waiter he looked at me and walked right past. I walked up to the bar to talk to a waitress and she was super rude. First come first serve on a busy night is bad business, wasting an entire 8 top table on three people, not to mention 3 or 4 tables. There would have been plenty of room to seat more people had there been any structure. I had 5 people with me that would have been buying drinks and food, there loss. We won't be visiting this establishment again!",1.0
"This was my first time trying southern BBQ. And it was AMAZING. I got burnt ends, Mac and cheese & hushpuppies. Everything was delightful. I also sampled everyone else's BBQ at my table and none of it was disappointing. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for great BBQ!",5.0
"Went to The Chicken Scoop today after hubs raved about it. He was right (as always ). I got the Southern & the Berry. Being a Southern Belle myself, I know a good chicken salad when I taste it - and hunny, this chicken salad will make your tongue flog your chin just to get another bite!! The Quinoa Black-Eyed Pea salad was tasty. I tried a bite of hubby's Thai - too spicy to suit my taste! But he likes it, so we were both happy. The tiny shots of 'Naner Puddin' were an unexpected - and delicious addition. Just like Sunday dinner in the South. Y'all come back now, ya'hear?!",5.0
"Appetizers-fritters are a better choice than the spinach broccoli dip. The dip was too rich for my taste. Had the corn and bean sliders-very flavorful. Service is excellent.

I recommend that they stain them, but just a suggestion.",4.0
"I was recently fortunate enough to come across a bag of free records curbside, which included some great music such as jimi hendrix, Fleetwood Mac,  led zeppelin, b.b king, etc. I no longer have a record player, and I'm not a collector myself so I decided I wanted to sell them, but with no background knowledge for vinyls I was left clueless with what to price them at. I am new to Toronto, and turned to Google for record appraisals in the area- Kops records was the first to pop up in the search. I checked Yelp for other reviews and liked what I had to read, so I called and reached out to them for assistance. The friendly staff member I spoke to on the phone put me in contact with his colleague, Nick, who has an expertise in this sort of thing. 
Nick was kind and professional, and offered to have a look at the records at no cost. I dropped them off at the shop on a Monday and told him no rush, as there were about 35 records in the bunch and I did not want to take away from his time for business, but by Wednesday I had already heard back from him with his thoughts on their value. He offered to have me come back by the shop so that he could go over it with me in person, and was more than patient when I was swarmed with work and it, shamefully, took me two weeks to come back in. 
Nick was obviously very thorough, taking the time to examine each record and price it at what he thought was fair. I was pleasantly surprised and so appreciative of this and that he also took the time to clearly explain things to me, someone who is completely new to the subject. 
While he did express interest in a few of them, he stressed that I was in no way obligated to sell any to him, that I was free to take them and do as I wished. It is so rare to find good people like this in the world who will lend a helping hand without asking anything in return. 
I am truly blown away by the customer experience here at Kops Records, and I may not be a record enthusiast, but I would certainly reccomend them to anyone who is. Wonderful people! For all the time it took Nick to do this for me, I thought I could, at the very least, take 5 minutes out of my day to express my gratitude! 

My sincerest thank yous to Nick and the wonderful staff at Kops Records, 

Paige",5.0
I ordered a delicious ham & bacon quiche while my sis ordered the prosciutto cheese omelet.  Very tasty perfect portions.

It's 2 eggs, chorizo, avocado and jalapeno cream cheese in a flour tortilla and comes with side of hash browns. I added shine Chula green pepper sauce to add shine great to it. They have btw they have 6 Chula flavors and other hot sauce choices. Have fountain soda, fresh brewed coffee with multiple milk and cream choices and a plethora of sweetener options. My mom got the meat scramble 9.50, however she felt the scramble size was small. It's 2 eggs, bacon, sausage and ham. It does come with hash browns and toast for sides.

"Staying at the ""Death Ray"" (Vdara), and wanted someplace for lunch.  The City Center ""complex"" has turned (apparently) into a home away from home for us -- last time we were at the Mandarin Oriental, and ""Crystals"" is the adjoining shopping center/mall where Todd English's P.U.B. is located.  My wife and I checked out the menu prior to leaving Berkeley, and knew this would be a great spot for lunch . . . 

Todd English is like the under-the-radar Bobby Flay.  Aside from the Home Shopping Network (or is it QVC?), you really don't see him on television much, but between Olive's, Figs, and who knows what else, he's everywhere!  But this is his first and, to date, only PUB (or Public Urban Bar).  

Countless beers on tap -- I think over 60 -- including some cask conditioned ales (yes!), the food is close to perfect, and the portions are HUGE!  Lynn and I made the delicious mistake of ordering too much food, and thank heavens reinforcements arrived to help us finish!

We had something called ""Dirty Chips"" -- America's answer to nachos, this is sinfully good and truly dangerous!  Kettle chips tossed in bleu cheese, bits of amazingly delicious bacon, scallions, and served with fried chicken livers . . . just add beer and a football game and you're in heaven (albeit on a rapid descent to hell, if your doctor ever finds out!).  Seriously delicious, but don't order this unless you can share it with at least three other people!  (And if you try it on your own, make sure to have one of those defibrillators they have in airports at the ready!)

The iceberg wedge with bleu cheese and a bacon vinaigrette, avocado, tomato, and chopped egg is a classic, and served ice cold; the duck buns (three to an order) with shredded duck, hoisin and scallions were better than they had a right to be (delicious, though better at a true dim sum palace, to be honest).  And then, we moved onto the mains . . . 

Lynn had the pastrami sliders -- three excellent little sandwiches on rye parker house rolls, with kraut, swiss cheese and served with skinny fries . . . OK, I had one of the three.

I opted for the brown butter lobster rolls -- three rolls filled with freshly shucked lobster, warm brown butter aioli, served with slaw and kettle chips -- as if we hadn't had enough of those already!

All this paired beautifully with pints of Chimay white (in the proper glasses, BTW) -- a very filling, but very delicious lunch.  In fact, it's almost noon as I write this . . . maybe I'll have lunch there today, too.

Two more notes:

1) ""Good for kids,"" as always, will depend more upon the kids than the restaurant.

"This location used to be an Extreme Fitness location, so is bigger than most typical crammed Goodlife gyms.

Positives
Very large and spacious gym facility.  Wide range of free weights and machines.  Endless cardio equipment.  Legs area upstairs is also very spacious with lots of equipment (3 squat racks!).  Even during peak hours it's generally possible to get a proper workout done.  Plus it has a pool.

Negatives
Main workout area is underground and doesn't get much natural light.  Feels a bit dungeouny.  The workout areas of the gym are really split into three separate areas, quite far from each other, so it's a bit annoying if you're doing full body workout days.  The pool is often taken up at lunch by some ""Aquafit"" class, which is really just an instructor telling people to float on water.  Also, since being taken over by Goodlife they're going on an aggressive membership recruitment drive and are targetting a lot of teenagers.  They haven't taken over the gym yet, but if it starts getting flooded with them, it might get pretty crowded.",4.0

My husband and I celebrated our 18 year anniversary Saturday. The steak and shrimp was delicious and the swordfish was also very good. The food was on point but nothing wowed me. There are several high end steak restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from. The atmosphere was warm and low lighting made it a little more private and romantic.

"My hubby and I came out to run some errands and decided to stop by this restaurant for dinner. They give you a free Thai iced tea when you purchase an appetizer and an entree. We ordered the chicken spring rolls, basil pad Thai, and drunken noodles. The Thai iced tea was amazing! It tasted like a light dolce de leche drink with ice. The basil pad Thai was perfect. It wasn't spicy, but it wasn't too mild either. My husband had the drunken noodles which were spicy. It wasn't so spicy that we couldn't handle it, but just enough to maybe make you cough if you get the food down the wrong hole. 

My husband is a big time foodie and is currently passed out in a food coma. If he's passed out, then I think this place deserves five stars. Service was friendly, but adequate.

"It's the Denny of Cosmo, that stays open late. 

I was busy getting ready for the massive halloween night, was to lazy to yelp a good restaurant and make a decision on dinner. I passed this responsibility on to a non yelper friend who selected THE HENRY, because it was right next to entrance. 

What a FAIL., It was nice, located on a prime spot, great place for sports and people watching. 

Service was slow, food was bad for the price we paid and our waiter was RUDE. 

Ordered a $36 steak and it really did just come with JUST THE STEAK no sides.  Prime rib was dry and thick,.. best thing I had, was the bacon my friend didn't want on his burger and my french onion soup. My truffle tater tots were good too, but I don't think it's worth $7. 

I didn't like how the waiter would ask my friend, do you want soup or salad on the side? when it didn't even come with the entree.  The waiter  pretty much tried to upsell my friends, misleading them; that it came with our entree. Lucky I asked before they placed the order in. 

On top, it took us 45 mins to get our food and they already added gratuity to our bill. SMH.  What a waste of a yelp spot.

The moral of the story: You get what you pay for. 

The pasta was so bland that I can't even think of an adjective to describe how bland it was. (Did I just blow your mind?)

"I called this plumbing company on Sunday of the Family Day long weekend as I had a broken tub drain pipe. My regular plumber told me Tuesday and New Canadian Plumbing told me they would be there on Monday between 11am and noon. Well that did not happen, in fact I called them a few times during the day and they kept telling me different times but not once did they ever call me to say they would be late. Finally after 6 pm the plumber called me and told me he couldn't get parts and I should call them Tuesday.

Tuesday I don't think so on Tuesday morning I will be calling my regular plumber and will never try New Canadian Plumbing again

Don't lie about when you can come and at least keep your customers up to date I had lots of other things to do that day besides waiting for a plumber

"For a system that is always being renovated and a staff that spends more time on strike than actually working... the TTC is just getting worse and worse. I am a heel -Toe express girl normally but last night I was heading to a friends housewarming / engagement party up in the landsdowne and davenport area from Spadina ave. I promised a few friends I would meet them at Lansdowne station at 930.. By 901pm I was in position to get on the streetcar and head up.... 

first streetcar - a detour from dundas ( 906pm ish)
second streetcar - a detour from dundas (912pm ish)
third streetcar - a detour from dundas (918pm ish)
fourth streetcar - Spadina - my transportation (924pm) 

Clearly there is something lacking in their schedules posted.. every 6-8 minutes... i don't think so. Obviously I was late and frustrated and cursing our transit system... yet again.

"After reading other reviews, it seems that this is a common problem in this particular store... no body would help me, period!  My husband and I went in together and went our separate ways (he went to the surround sound, I went to the cameras).  Apparently he had a similar experience, but I can only account for what I personally went through.  I knew exactly what I was looking for because I've been doing a lot of research online, and was ready to try it out in person.. really get some good info and see how it felt in my hands, how it worked, etc.  After basically loitering around the DSLR camera's for about 15 minutes waiting for some help (everyone around me was helping other people or just literally ignoring my attempts at contact) and going totally un-noticed, I decided to just figure it out on my own.  When I picked up the camera and attempted to use it, an alarm started going off so I put it back down and waiting for someone to come.  An employee did in fact come, but his only mission was to turn that alarm off!  When I tried to engage in some kind of conversation he literally just turned around and walked away.  Ooooookay, so that's the game we're going to play.  So I picked the camera back up and, yep, you guessed it, set the alarm off again, and patiently waited for someone to come back.  It just so happened that it was the same guy from last time, and although looking especially irritated at my tactics, I smiled at him and told him I was glad he came back because I would like some help.  His idea of ""helping"" me was standing there with his hands on his hips just watching me struggle, saying nothing.  So I finally asked him if he could help me out and give me some info and answer some questions, and his response was simply ""that's not how you do it!"" - in response to what I was doing concerning the camera.  Let me paint a picture for you- I'm standing there, holding an almost $1,000 camera, with the intent to purchase.  I dont know about you, but I can think of a couple better ways to handle that situation as an employee.  And regardless of how much it was or what my plans were, it's called customer service.. maybe best buy needs to do some retraining or coaching because I'm obviously not the only one who has had issues in this department.",1.0
"This is a really great restaurant that has to over come some unfortunate location issues.  If you are traveling down Mcclintock then it is hidden behind a vacant Mexican / fast food restaurant.  If you are traveling down Broadway it is hidden behind a very large BK.  I know I have driven by many a time and never seen this place.  The parking lot is very rough and needs to be paved in a bad way.

The restaurant is the complete opposite of it's surroundings.  It is very bright and contemporary inside.  A very pleasant dining room with very cool decor.  The staff is really nice and the menu is pretty varied.  My only complaint would be it needs a few more vegetarian options.  Next time I go in I'll ask if there are any recommendations.  I had the vegan tamales on my lunch visit and they were outstanding.  They come in three flavors, but the Jalapeno Hummus ones were the best.  I know hummus in a tamale sounds weird but they were very good.  They have a really good vegan artichoke  dip/sauce I wouldn't have believed it was vegan.

Next time you pass by give them a try.

"I started taking my pug puppy here a couple of months ago, for vaccinations & routine exams. The techs are always wonderful & are very excited to see my puppy when we walk in the door. It's always easy to schedule an appointment and we usually don't have to wait very long once we're there. As everyone else has mentioned, the facilities are super clean and nice. 

We have seen 3 doctors so far, and Dr. Pittman is our absolute favorite. He has great bedside manner and you can tell he really has a love for animals. I also like that he takes the time to talk to the humans about issues, etc. and does a great job at explaining what he's doing & why. 

We saw Dr. Stewart once and she was ok. She was super gentle when giving our pup her first vaccinations and nail trimming, but she wasn't very talkative with us. 

Our least favorite doctor has been Dr. Adams. It felt like she was rushing the visit. Our puppy had an ear infection and she took our puppy out of the exam room (and away from us) for 30 minutes to examine her ears. By the time she brought our puppy back, she was freaked out and terrified, which made giving her vaccinations and trimming her nails a nightmare. I've never heard my puppy make such horrible noises! (We had a follow up visit with Dr. Pittman & he took the puppy out of the room for 5 minutes & returned her to wait with us while he examined her ear cultures. Doing this created a much calmer environment.) I will definitely never see Dr. Adams again.",4.0
"I am a spa regular in my hometown of Washington, DC, so I'm picky about the facility and therapists. Looking for a girls' weekend treat for my sister, I found Evolve on Yelp. The old house in which it's located is spacious and walcoming, in no small part to the staff. I worked with Becky and my sister worked with Helen, and we both had 90 minute Swedish massages. On par with the best I've had in DC and beyond. 

Helen and Becky were both technically great, as well as having a really good sense for 'reading' clients. Like silence during your session? No problem. Like talking during your session? No problem - they're both professional and very friendly. The manager, Robin, is delightful, and made the visit extra-special for us. She also took the time at the end of the day to share some of her favorite kale recipies with my sister. 

Highly, highly recommended.
Note: a vegan mani-pedi is offered.

EVOLVE MONTHLY CLUB PLAN: They offer a monthly 'club' plan where you pay $59/month auto-billed on your credit card, and in return you not only get your choice of a 60 minute massage OR facial OR mani-pedi, you get a standing 'club rate' of $59 for any ADDITIONAL services you buy during the month. That's amazing for 'frequent fliers' - and you get the traditional spa experience, instead of the more clinical ""physical therapy"" feeling that comes with massage chains. I've never seen a private spa that can compete with the chains with a club like this - please patronize this wonderful local business!",5.0
"Wow I was very disappointed :/ I love eating shabu Shabu and this is the first place I've had in Vegas ... 

As for this experience, we had a group of friend for a birthday dinner - party of about 10 it 11 ppl. I'm not sure if it was due to being the first big group there for dinner - but the service was the worst. Horrible on refilling both drinks and broth, clearing the table, and even bringing out our appetizers.  Then throughout the night the place was getting more and more packed ... Which made it even worse.  I didn't like there set up too.  They had a grocery store style fridge where all the meat/veggies are.  It was  difficult and time consuming to grab your food because there will be lines of people at every angle.  :/ then to add on to that we didn't even get all of our appetizer orders.  

Besides those things- their food was pretty fresh and individually wrapped in their self serve fridge.  They even had a sauce making section.  ( my favorite is to combine soy sauce ginger and cilantro ).

I'll admit I did have lots to eat but I didn't walk out the restaurant feeling like I would come back ....",3.0

"Sat at the bar for happy hour. The service was EXCELLENT, it was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is upscale casual. 

We arrived during the happy hour menu which is 5-7, and sat at the bar. The complimentary fresh cooked BBQ chips were excellent! They offer 5 cocktails, 5 wines, 5 appetizers and a burger and blue moon at special pricing. Tonight we had the calamari, the burger with shoe string fries, 2 glasses of the 14 hands cab and 3 blue moons. The tab came to $43. 

The burger was cooked perfectly to order at medium. The fries were fries. I feel at this type of place, the burger needed an acidic topping to cut the fat on the pallet, like pickle. The ketchup, which was on the side, did the job, but it was a bottled variety. At happy hour pricing of $8, it was very good. The calamari had a pepper jelly type sauce with peppers. I highly prefer this style to the Italian red sauce. It was perfectly cooked as I'd expect at this level of a place. The 14 hands was priced ok at $8, which was happy hour pricing. Regular price at $9.50 is high. I guess you're paying for the feeling that you're spending a little more to eat out. 

Worth the stop during happy hour. Outside of that, not sure if the prices accurately represent the product. Enjoyed our visit!",3.0
"I visited Palette soon after it opened at 11AM on a Wednesday. I was seated and taken care of right away. Even though I was in a seat that was kind of hidden, my server checked on me every few minutes. I didn't have any of the service issues other people have noted on Yelp, but then, I was also one of the first customers of the day.

As for the food--oh my. I ordered the Mission Fig Salad. It was gorgeous. I should have taken a picture of it. The lettuce was green and purple with the full chicken breast neatly sliced to one side. Big crumbles of blue cheese, sliced fig, and candied pecans dappled the outer edge like Christmas presents beneath a tree. The balsamic vinaigrette complemented the sweetness of the figs and pecans in a wonderful way; sweet, but not too sweet. It's a big salad but it's not a heavy salad, not like a chop salad might be at another place. I didn't have any leftovers.

Also, it came with a toasted slice of bread. It was perfectly done--crunchy but not hard. It tasted very fresh with just the right amount of butter.

The cost ($13.50) was more than most salads at restaurants, but considering the local ingredients, I thought it was quite reasonable. I would absolutely eat at Palette again. I'd love to try some of their other salads.",4.0

"Representatives blatantly lied to us about 2 different contract terms, and about the ability to transfer one of our numbers from another Verizon account. The last 2 days have been hell trying to cancel these contracts and return our devices. Within 14 days of activation you are within a trial period and can cancel and return the devices.

However, if you shopped with Z Wireless you must return the devices to the same store you got that from (which is an hour away for us, while we live 5 minutes from another.) and there must happen to be a manager ON SITE because they require the store managers ""override"" to cancel a contract. He wasn't in? Tough luck for us. They also want you to pay a ""restocking fee"" for each device. Make no mistake... these people are out for your money, and there is nothing but disadvantage to shopping with Z Wireless over Verizon corporate.

"I was in the hunt for a new place to check out. Specially one near my hood. Since as you can imagine, as a foodie it is always great to have good restaurants nearby. 

Daio seems to be going the more authentic route than say, cheap sushi houses like New Generation and Sushi on Bloor, which shows in their decour and also in their menu. With dark wood accents and Japanese paintings, areas of the restaurant --specifically the booths, feel more intimate and far less cafeteria style than most sushi restaurants.   

Even their servers have a more Japanese sense of pomp and circumstance and deem to provide what most people would think a more Japanese experience. With zen-like music playing in the background, of course. ;-) 

Aside a better decour, I must admit I felt as if I was not getting a good food vs money value from my lunch. Their sushi dishes tend to be on the small side... for the price, and the presentation of such does not compare to the subjective flamboyancy you would get at say Guu, Wow sushi or Tokyo Kitchen which charge only a bit more for most of their dishes.  

Basically what I am saying is that it feels you are paying for the nice ambiance not for the food or vivacity like you do at the aforementioned Japanese strongholds. 

I can't say it is the best sushi I ever had, however, it offers an more 'authentic' experience than most. Daio definitely deserves a second look so I will be updating my review later when I go back to check more items on their menu.",3.0
"We left both our dog and cat here for 6 nights. There was a TV in the cat room going 24/7 (sorry, what cat likes to listen to people noise constantly?), the room temperature was hot - not even 72 degrees felt more like 80...

I told the staff my cat is a picky eater and I brought her own food and told them she likes her food fresh. I explained what fresh meant: resealing the ziplock seal on the bag of food, if she doesn't eat all of her food dump the food back in the bag and pour some more (heh sneaky sneaky), and lastly clean the food bowl at least every 2-3 days.
When I picked her up she was half the weight she was when we brought her in. She was very lethargic, unresponsive, shaky. One of the staff that walked me back to get her had told me she had not eaten for 5 days....!!!!!!!!!!!!?!???!?!?! I NEVER got a phone call, nothing. I was so angry. They wouldn't even discount her stay. They didn't follow my feeding instructions. I was and still am livid about the ordeal. This was back in July (2012), the week of the 4th. It took her a month to get back to normal plus a trip to our vet.

"Finally got a chance to try this out today, and I left pretty impressed. Got the double sauteed pork lunch special with chicken wings and lo mein. Even with a $1.50 upcharge for the lo mein, it still only came to $8.39, AND that included a drink.

I seemed to get there at the very beginning of the lunch crowd, as it was empty when I arrived, but by the time I left, it was nearly full. Food came out really fast, and I wasn't surprised, because when I walked in, I could see back into the kitchen, and it was very well-staffed.

The chicken wings and the pork were great, but my favorite part was the lo mein. It's kinda how I judge Chinese places, as a lot of them have greasy lo mein, or lo mein that is just flavorless. But not here. They were perfectly cooked, and super garlic-y (which is a major plus for my tastes).

"A roti is essentially a hardy flour pancake wrapped around a curry dish which can include chicken, chickpeas (on the menu as channa), goat, etc.

It's not exactly a healthy lunch but it is definitely filling and delicious! By filling I mean heavy, these things weigh, no joke, like 2 lbs! I've never managed to finish one in a single sitting.

After standing in line in the main room where you order, pay and wait for your meal to be presented you can head into the dining room to eat your roti (which is actually really nice), or take the food away with you in a brown paper bag.

They have other options on the menu too like jerk chicken, but why would you go to a roti hut and not order a roti?

The roti themselves are pretty mild, but the hot sauce they offer (you have to ask for this) makes my forehead just drip sweat!

"I love this place. I have been here several times and have always enjoyed my meal. I like that although it's billed as a seafood place, their other offers are also top notch! I have had great luck with their service too. The owners are generally there and really care that you have a good experience. I like that they have different events throughout the year and have seasonal drink menus. It's just so nice to have something of this quality in the SE Valley! Oh! I also like that you can go here in a T-shirt or a coat and tie -it's a comfortable place for all! Two tips - try their wings. They are not the typical wing in taste or appearance - but awesome! Second - make a reservation!",5.0
"I'm not sure if this place deserves 1 or 2(because i feel bad for this place-it sucks!)stars. I got 6 whites and 1 full egg scrambled all together! I got raped, seriously when I got my bill. $25! For 7 freaking egg white! Actually, I asked for 6 egg whites and 1 full egg(which means-HELLO! I WANT THE GOSH DAMN YOLK!) To that of which I did not Get! At least give me a fake drink umbrella or throw on some dried out cilantro to make them look festive. 
Ugh, I wanna write bad things about this restaurant but its not worth it. Probably because I feel so dumb paying for it and not asking why the charge is so high! 

And to make matters even worse! I gave them a $2 tip! Is that stupid or stupider?

"If you think you're going to get Mexican food, go somewhere else now. I'm from Nor Cal so I think I've been spoiled with Mexican food. We went in here because we were REALLY hungry, there was a line so we thought it was good food. Ordered the chimichanga burrito and the regular chicken burrito. It took a while to get our orders since it was busy dinner time. I was standing at the counter and did realize that they put EVERYTHING in the microwave. We took it to go and when we go to our rooms we realized we hadn't gotten any chips or salsa, and biting into the burritos there was absolutely no flavor in the food. It was like they just through stuff together and hoped for a miracle. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for food...Gordon Ramsey would go crazy if he came in here...",1.0
"The one star is for the decor, it really is a pity star.

We just left from a dinner service and we less than impressed. No hot water in the bathroom! Cold air in the air dryer! Insane.

Had fish and chips which we thought would be safe but it wasn't, shit fries. The creme brûlée was terrible as well, tasted and had the consistency of a snack pack pudding.

Place needs to do some work and management needs to take a hard look at themselves to save this dive. Bet is closed next October.",1.0
"I really have no complaints about this really cute, big, family diner (yes, a real DINER in Cleveland!) in the West Park neighborhood. Service, as mentioned in other reviews, is lightning fast. Like, I didn't know you could cook an omelette that quickly! Let alone make it taste delicious. 

The corned beef hash is made in-house and is really great; it actually tastes like corned beef as opposed to overly salty potatoes. A real treat.

The waitresses were really nice and charming. It seems like this place has its fair share of ""regulars"" but the people who work here offer up a smile and friendly conversation to just about anybody who walks through the door.

The staff was also amazing at service and at never being idle. If they weren't waiting on tables, they were slicing bread, pouring dressing into individual cups for salads, and other little tasks that makes the rest of the day go smoother because they can just reach into the fridge and pull stuff out. Smart.

We could have been out in 20 minutes if we had been in a hurry, but we weren't. Despite the quick turnover of tables, we never felt rushed, and we were able to enjoy a leisurely meal.

The place is a little raggedy, but it's obvious that nobody should really care about the way it looks so long as the food is good, cheap, and quick, and the service is great. And George's has all those qualities. Highly recommend for anyone who cares more about food and consistency than about what's popular and overpriced in the nearby areas.",5.0
"Oh my... I hate having to give a bad review, but the food here was not good at all. I give the 2 stars for the service, as our server was very attentive. 

The atmosphere is fun, the location is great, but the food is just overpriced yuck. My husband said it was probably the worst meal he's had in Vegas. He had a pulled pork sandwich with his side dishes put in ramekins, more size suited for condiments. I'd ordered chicken wings and a side of fries. My chicken wings tasted like extra salty hotdogs. Not sure how that happened? Our kids had mac&cheese, and a kids cheeseburger. The cheeseburger looked fine, but my daughter wouldn't eat it because of the char grill. She's like Hank from 'King Of The Hill'  - wants to ""taste the meat, not the heat.""   

I can say with sincerity that I will not be back. Looks like a cool enough bar though. Stop for a drink, but pass on the food. There are so many better choices out there!",2.0

"Well, I had occasion to eat there with my son and Mom on a Sunday a few weeks ago.  It is a smaller space, around 10-12 tables.  It was full with a steady stream of carry-out orders as well.  The young lady who was our server was Sweet and helpful!  Said it was her 2nd job on the weekends that she just did for FUN! Serving people for fun! Great!  We tipped her $8 on a $28 ticket!  One of the Owners kept walking around doing random checks on everyone.  I WAS THRILLED with the Sweet Potato Pancakes!  Very delicious and filling! The wings were Jumbo and I had them for lunch the next day. They also have a Sweet Potato Large Waffle which I plan to try next time I visit. My son actually had the ""Broadway Burger Meal.  I believe my mom had something like the ""Ms. Rubye's or Jessie Breakfast Meal. Everyone was happy with their selection. Football was on the mounted tv for the Football Fans! Parking is a challenge on some days as space is limited. Hopefully, with MORE PATRONAGE they will obtain a larger space to feed more people well!",4.0
"You know that person (I won't say girl, just to avoid sounding sexist)  who walks into a hardware store with that look on their face that just about screams: ""I don't know what the hell I'm doing""?

Yeah, that was me. The staff here were extremely helpful, they knew exactly what I needed and where to find it. The gentleman helping me even opened the box and made sure it was the exact size item I needed.

The whole trip took about five minutes. Easy. 

Would definitely come back.",5.0
"We were seated quickly and our waitress was super nice.   My expectations for airport food was not very high and was not great as expected.

It was quick though and there are limited options here.",3.0
Took a trip to Glendale Arizona for a Cardinals game so my brother and I had a free Saturday. We decided to go bet on the ponies at Turf Paradise. We both had a real good time eating their food from their club house and making some money from a few bets we hit. Their chili dogs are awesome and huge. The track itself has seen better days as it needs a facelift as everything looks from another era. But in a strange way this  added to the uniqueness of the experience.  There was alot of people as it was a Saturday so atmosphere was electric.  Definitely look forward to going again soon for their Kentucky Derby party May 2nd. I heard it is really fun and definitely the place to be on the first Saturday in May. See you again soon Turf Paradise.,5.0
"This is one of the restaurants located in the beautiful and spacious MGM hotel.  While the restaurants in the MGM hotel are ""open"" because you can see the gaggle of crowds walking by, this place still gives a nice intimate feel.  I came here with about 5-6 coworkers and we were able to have nice dinner conversation. 

What I ordered: 
-Seafood gumbo:  This had a nice kick to it and had a good amount of seafood and veggies to it.  I really liked it and wanted another plate, but decided not to.  

-Seafood pan roast - a good amount of seafood and sausage. It wasn't the largest portion and I thought it could have been bigger, but everything went well together. From the fish to the mussels to the sausage, it was an explosion of flavours.

Overall, if you have the budget, this is a great place to try in Vegas.",5.0

"A friend of mine invited us to dinner here.  It's been a while since we've been to Macaroni Grill.  We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time, but in recent years have ignored it.

I have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce, $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since I'm on a no Meat diet.

The Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach Orzo, $14.99).

I didn't like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didn't have much flavor....bland, which has never happened to me when I've ordered it.

The Better Half enjoyed her Sole, but didn't think it was anything beyond average.

My friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.

If I was rating this dinner on my experience alone, it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal, I'm bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didn't ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.

"We just visited Mark Mitsubishi Glendale last night and purchased a new 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage. Overall, we definitely had a great experience. Our last Mitsubishi was purchased used from the Scottsdale location, and I must say that the Glendale location is much better. While we didn't have any serious issues in Scottsdale, the experience just was not as pleasant as it was over here in Glendale. 

Over in Scottsdale, it took at least twice as long for the entire process. However, Glendale stated that their policy is to get customers in and out within 3 hours. They had this almost exactly -- after test driving, negotiating, paperwork, and making sure we were satisfied with everything after, it took about 3 hours and 10 minutes. Fantastic! Since we had just spent over 8 hours at a dealership last week, we were extremely thankful for how fast Mark Mitsubishi was.

Our sales rep was Stacey Hertig, and she's awesome. If you are ever interested in purchasing a Mitsubishi, she's your woman. She was very laid back, easy going, friendly, and had great customer service. She also made sure that we got what we wanted at all points in the process. She said, ""Tell me what you want and I'll go up to bat for you."" She definitely delivered on this. She also made sure we were happy even with the tiniest of details, such as if we wanted Mark Mitsubishi key chains at the end--we didn't, and she said that was fine! :) I know that's not a big deal for most people, but it was for us! haha.

Stacey also worked well with Nick Redondo in financing. Of course, this IS a car dealership, and they want to make money, so there were some standard sales tactics used. However, they weren't pushy or anything and took our feedback well. We had a few pleasant exchanges, discussions, and negotiations. At one point, we were afraid we were going to have to leave and sell our trade-in private party and come back later, but Nick came back with a great offer for the trade-in value. We didn't expect that much for the trade-in at all, and it actually came out to about the same as if we had sold it private party (after tax breaks). It was definitely a pleasant surprise, and Nick definitely saved the sale at that point.

If we ever need a new Mitsubishi, I know we will head back to this place for sure. Thanks again, Mark Mitsubishi Glendale! :)",5.0
"Don't waste your time. I tried to schedule an appointment and the receptionist was so rude on the phone, like I was wasting her time! She huffed on the phone as if she was too busy to schedule me an appointment. Then she stated that they only do an exam and xray on the first visit and you have to come back for cleaning. That is double billing! Every single dentistry does the exam, xray, and cleaning on the first visit!

Job was promised completion in one day.  Took over a week.  Constant no shows and excuses.  Salesman promised it would be done to my satisfaction.  NOT.  Poor communication between salesman and installers.  Owner was very combative when I voiced my frustrations.  He did meet with me after pleading in my part.  I wanted to make changes.

"I have been here twice, once when it was very busy (Wednesday at 6:00 PM) and I got their last available table and again (Thursday at 5:00 PM) when we were the only ones in the restaurant other than the staff.  The first visit I dined alone and due to the crowd it took 5 minutes to get my menu and another 15 minutes to place my order and then 15 minutes to get my food.  I thought this was reasonable due to the fact that there was only one server but I also believed they were understaffed. While waiting I decided the decor appeared worn but clean and the TV was a bit of an annoyance.  I would have preferred traditional Korean background music and the pictures on the wall of the food and their descriptions may be of interest to others but not my cup of tea, to use an overburdened metaphor.  Speaking of tea I ordered a pot of tea and received a piping hot green tea that tasted like swamp-water.  For me this is a good thing.  I ordered the Duk Boki for my appetizer and it was a nice portion with finger size solid noodles in a bed of spicy chili sauce with what I believe were mustard greens.  It was very satisfying and had a nice sweat inducing burn.  My entrée was their Bul Goki and it was the best I ever had with a light sweet soy on the front and a smoky finish.  The beef was tender, moist and high quality served over grilled onions and a side bowl of rice.  It also came with seven side bowls of Kimchi many I never had before and all of them were delicious.  I returned the following night with my son and we were seated immediately and given our menus with our order placed quickly.  Our food arrived almost immediately and we split an order of shrimp dumplings that were also the best ever.  Eight of them came with a side of soy seasoned with a heavy dose of garlic, ginger and other ingredients I cannot identify but enjoyed very much.  They were also grilled which I liked and larger than others I've had elsewhere.  This time my entrée was the Kalbi which are their Korean barbecued Short Ribs and again the smokiness and seasonings were delicious.  My son had the Bul Goki at my recommendation and he also enjoyed it very much.  We received about nine bowls of Kimchi with a couple different variations from the other night.  It was difficult to determine which I preferred they were all so good.  To summarize I would give Cafe' Ga Hyang 5 stars for their food, 4 stars for the service and 3 stars for the facility and price.  I will definitely return for more of their epicurean delights.  NOTE: Cafe' Ga Hyang no longer serves any alcohol.",4.0
"Short story:  This place is a scam and preys on elderly patients. 

Long story: The people at Aspen Dental convinced my 85 year old grandmother that she needed extensive work on her teeth and then asked her to fill out a credit application for $4,500.

After consulting with a different dentist my grandmother decided not to go with Aspen Dental.  They then told her that they already processed her credit application and took the money - and she hadn't even had a procedure.  She was on the hook for $4,500. Did I mention that the women is EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD?

"My boyfriend and I have come here twice so far and will most definitely be coming back soon. I love the overall feel and atmosphere of this place. The waitresses definitely add to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

We have gotten the pan con tomate both times because it is so fresh and tasty! We also got a salad with cucumbers, fresh feta, green onions, and roasted peppers and I dusted that dish off quick! We splurged and got the $20 cheese, but, and preserve plate. I did not like the bleu cheese at all but the other 3 were delicious. There was a fig served on the side that was obviously soaked in some sort of alcohol. It was a little overpowering. We ended up taking the leftovers of the cheese plate home.

My boyfriend ordered the clay pot and didn't eat much because he was so stuffed from the cheese and and complementary bread that comes with dinner. We have the leftovers in the fridge right now :P

The first time we came here, we got the vereniki which is like a pirogi. It was so amazing and had a very light flavor. My boyfriend got the goulash and liked it very much! It wasn't what I was expecting but he really enjoyed it. I got the adjarski khachapurri which is a boat-shaped bread with cheese and egg in it. It was soo filling and tasty. I'll definitely get that again!!

As far as drinks, we got 3 different drinks and they were during happy hour so it was cheap! I got an angry ginger lemonade and it was wayyyy too gingery for me so my boyfriend drank it. He ordered the GF forte jackass and said it was too gingery but I thought it wasn't too bad! I wanted to get a drink with no ginger so I asked about the gypsytini and the waitress said there wasn't any ginger in it. I ordered it and I was very impressed!

"This was our final meal of the trip.  My apple cinnamon French toast was one for the ages.  Very fluffy pieces of challah.  My wife had a scramble with bacon, spinach and Monterey Jack cheese, and even the toast that accompanied it was above and beyond what most places pass off as toast.

Aside from the meal being top grade, I would say that the service here should be a model for all breakfast/brunch places to follow.  This is a very popular place, apparently, and they make it look so effortless to get everyone served promptly.  We were told the wait was 10 minutes, and it was probably five or so.  There was very little wait for the food to come out, and a new iced tea was put in front of me well before I had finished the current glass.

"I joined yelp to write my review and warn consumers about this place!  Go if you're a girl and you want a mullet....

One star: my SO came here several months ago, and got a decent haircut here. We recently moved here from LA, where there are lots of Asian salons, so we were glad to find one here through Yelp.  Jim was very, very quick. The whole experience lasted about 20 minutes. 

Since he did a decent job with the SO, I went to the salon two weeks ago to get my haircut.  I called in advance to ask when a good time would be since I had the whole day open.  I was advised to come in one hour later.  Note: only the woman that works there speaks English, Jim speaks very very little English.  

I show up at the appointment, and immediately see that there is another female getting her roots chemically straightened.  Why did he say to come in an hour when he's in the middle of another appointment?!? Suspicions arise...

The woman washes my hair thoroughly. I enjoyed it until her friend showed up out of nowhere and the two began speaking loudly in Korean. I am Asian, but not Korean.  It got a little uncomfortable.  She sets me in a chair, and I sit there with wet, drippy hair for almost twenty minutes.  The woman hands me a style magazine for women with digital perms to look at even though I already told her I was there for a haircut.  Eventually Jim comes over.  By this time, the woman, which speaks basic English, is gone and nowhere to be seen.  I explain that I am looking for a short hair cut, which is a big change from my long hair.  He quickly grabs a xeroxed copy of Jessica Alba with a layered bob chin length and points at that style. He says something about layers. I say okay, make me look good, not too much layers. 

I close my eyes - bad move, but habit since my mom is a hairdresser and I'm used to relaxing.  I trust hairdressers.  Maybe that  was my mistake.  Next thing I know, I have a horrendous mullet on top of my head. It looks like a dog chewed on my ends, and everything is uneven.  The top (crown) portion of the head is definitely shorter than the bottom.  He finishes off his creation by saying, do you know hair wax... then scrunches hair wax in really, really hard.  It was horrible!!!!  I have never had such a bad haircut, and I've gone to beauty schools before! It took him all of 10 mins, max 15 minutes to do all that damage.  

I paid because I could not wait to get out, walked out, and drove home, thinking that I was too sensitive. I got home, took a look at the damage that was done, and promptly called Toni + Guy at San Tan Village. In 30 mins, I was at Toni + Guy. Thank goodness Ashley fixed my mullet!!!!

With all of that, the biggest disappointment was the pre made Old Fashioned, poured out of a barrel.  I had a better experience at RX Boiler Room.

"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(299/365) ""Sandwiches, Salads, and Such""

We finally made our way to Bronze Cafe after getting cut at Hi-Rollers nearby. After seeing the majority of highly rated reviews by fellow Yelpers, this visit was long overdue. 

The Tree of Life was what I originally planned, but it changed in a split second like a Jedi mind trick when I saw BACON JAM and MAPLE BACON described in the LGBTQ Sandwich, a pretty BOMB rendition of the BLT. We also chose to split the Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad with Candied Pecans. Service here is very pleasant and the workers even toss your salad order if you would like them to. Unfortunately, this salad was lacking in flavor and the pecans lacked that sweet toasted flavor. Their version of a Snickerdoodle was dry and crumbly. The Loving vs. Virginia (AKA Brookie) was nice, warm, chewy, and decadent.

Great spot to chill and meet up for a nice healthy lunch. I'd like to return to  try the highly raved about Tree of Life Pita and Bizness Salad because I heard it was the business...For now, it sits at a little more than A-OK for me.  ALOHA!!!

"This was a great deal!  My husband wanted to do it the first night we were there, but I said no.  Finally I decided that it was a good deal and we'd try it.

We bought it at 11:30am one morning and ended up eating a mid-afternoon snack, then a late dinner, and then breakfast the next morning.

Our first stop was lunch at the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood.  They had a great selection of everything!  Soups, salads, Mexican, American, etc.  They do have a crepes station, but the crepes are pre-made so I didn't try them.  You can also get cotton candy here, which seemed to be a favorite of many!

Our afternoon stop was at Le Village Buffet at the Paris.  VERY GOOD!  They had delicious prime rib.  A large selection of breads.  Interesting desserts and a made to order crepe station (with NUTELLA!!!) delicious!  There were lots of Greek food options as well.

That night we decided to try the Lago buffet at Caesers, but they were closed on Wednesday night so we high tailed it over to Harrah's Flavors Buffet, we got there right before 10.  It was ok.  They did have a good Mexican station with surprisingly delicious chicken.  They also had blue cotton candy here and our server told us to grab some to take (they had it wrapped up).  

We went to the Spice Market Buffet (PH) for breakfast.  It was so good, but I don't think you can go wrong.  I saw people in their pjs here and a few girls that were still wasted and dressed in skimpy dresses from the night before.

Stopped by on a random Wednesday afternoon-- how busy could it be? 2 people waiting in front of me, 2 barbers. Not bad, right?

First, of all, I was never greeted. The guys who worked here would look, but then go back to buzzing hair. Guess I don't exactly fit the customer base description (no tattoos no piercing) but still, can you make me feel like a customer?

Where it really got me was that one of the barbers decided to take a cigarette break after his customer #1. Cool and I have no problem with that. Then he came back in with some ""regular"" customer who proceeded to get a haircut immediately before me.  WTF?

I sort of watched it happen in disbelief before deciding to peace out. If this place is not your scene, I'd recommend saving yourself the time and trouble and going elsewhere.",3.0
"Hungry Howie's is good pizza IF you do NOT order the Thin Crust pizza. We accidentally got 2 Thin Crust pizzas because of a mis-worded online offer. The Thin Crust pizza is the WORSE pizza on earth. You would be better off going to Fry's and getting a frozen pizza. The Thin Crust pizza is basically a large saltine cracker with a smear of tomato sauce.  Absolutely the worse pizza of all time. This bad review is solely targeted at the Thin Crust pizza. The workers and managers at this location are great people and the stuffed crust pizza there is a good value and tastes good. BUT I repeat, the Thin Crust pizza is horrible. Even more and more beer did not help its genuinely bad bad taste. Whatever marketing idiot that dreamed the Thin Crust pizza up should not just be fired but black-listed from all pizza companies. Cold pork and beans tastes better than the Thin Crust pizza!

"Love this place.  Let's be honest, nail places are a dime a dozen and they are all pretty much the same unless you are truely at a SPA.  First, this is not a spa so don't let the name fool you.  They have 3 pedicure chairs and 5 or 6 hair chairs for hair cutting, 2 chairs for manicures and 1 room (I think) for waxing.  I'm getting there.......so, the reason I like this place so much is you can understand them much better than your typical nail place (yes I'm sorry but I like this), they are NICE and actually spend the time on your nails that you wish most places did.  They file your nails exactly right, they're not lazy about it. (most nail places file my nails, paint them and when I get home realize my nails are all crooked!)  The owner Kelly actualy does the nails and hair too.  I was in there today and they actually called her in because it was so busy and they didn't want to turn anyone away.  She was there in 8 minutes!  Troon (sp?) is great. Very friendly and surprisingly the best one there (most guys I find are not that great).  Down side?  1. Eye brow waxing is not as meticulous as I expect 2. They don't have cable tv so not only is the tv behind my head so I can't see it, but it stays on whatever local sports are on all the time.  They should invest in cable and 2 more tvs for all to enjoy.  I shouldn't be encouraging anyone else to go here since one of the reasons  I like it also is because it is small / quaint and I don't feel like I'm in a cattle line waiting to get my nails done fast and furious.  All in all - 2 thumbs up!  This is not a ""dime a dozen"" and if you don't mind some of the down sides, you'll enjoy this place. If you do, say hi to Troon for me!",4.0

"An adorable little place! (""little"" to be interpreted literally as the place only has a few tables) The service was super friendly and welcoming, the crepes were delicious, and prices were about average ($9.50 or so for a crepe). They certainly give off an authentically French vibe, and I am guessing this is why they don't offer any meat crepes (only vegetarian, egg, tuna, and salmon options). I thoroughly enjoyed my scrambled egg-filled crepe, but the foodie in me would have really liked to have thrown a strip or two of bacon in there....",4.0
"Completely underwhelmed with this experience. Went for lunch, had better service from the busser than our server, who was taking care of two other tables in the otherwise empty restaurant. Food was not worth the prices by a long shot, $15 for mac and cheese that was under seasoned. 
The entire place is also carrying a heavy chemical smell from their recent reno, which in time will no doubt fade, but currently didn't help with the experience. Those who are sensitive to odors might want to think twice if the rest of the review didn't already change your mind.
We will not be returning, and without some serious changes to their business plan, I doubt they will be around for long.",2.0
"I've been here a couple of times now and I've enjoyed it both times. The food is good but to be honest, I'm not up-to-speed on the types of food on the menu so I'm learning how to order here. Regardless, I've loved the two meals I have had. The last time i was there (two weeks ago) I had the Kufta pita wrap and it was awesome. I still think about how good it was.

I've been here two times now. The first time was good enough to bring me back and now I'm wanting to go again (three weeks later). So in my book it's worth the visit.

Lunch service is a little slow because they've only had one wait-person but it's not deal-breaker by any means. Knowing that now makes me relax more when I go there.",4.0
"HUGE WARNING - RED FLAGS

After moving out of a rental property this past weekend My wife and I used this company. We received a coupon in those money mailers, 3 rooms for $49 plus a hallway was free. So, of course we called to schedule a cleaning. When discussing what was needed they ended up quoting us a rate of $130, and stated it was higher because of the loft, and staircase that would need to be completed. We agreed and schedule the appt. When the technicians came out, they were suddenly telling us the rate was going to be $529!!!! Advised we would needed to do additional cleaning due to literally 4 pet urine markings. Keep in mind this is a 5lb Yorkie we are talking about here. Shocked by this, my wife and I told them no way, and that we would use a second company we had scheduled for the next day (should have used the second company). After declining the service the technician says ""give me a moment I'm going to contact the office and see what I can do."" The technician comes back to us and says ""ok, we'll do the services for $329. I'm going to take care of this for you."" He then explains to us by doing this service there will be no pet stains, or post service pet smells. He also advised there is a 30 guarantee on the service and if our former landlord found any problems or noticed any smells they would come back out and do it again.  We agreed and allowed them to complete the service.

5 days after the service, our former landlord contacts us saying the house had a strong pet odor from the carpets not being properly cleaned, and due to this she would be charging our deposit to once again have the carpers cleaned, this time by her company she uses. We explained that our service had a guarantee and we would send our cleaner out again. When contacting the office we spoke with the office manager, Hilda. She proceeded to tell us that the service we were promised wasn't completed, and that they don't offer a 30 day guarantee on there work. She explained that we only paid $329 vs the $529 we were quoted so only a portion was done. When we explained what we were told by the technician, we were told that's not possible, even though the services to be completed were still listed in the receipt. When we asked to speak with the technician we were told that also was not possible.  When asked to speak to the owner, Carlos, to express our concerns. We were again told that was not possible. When asking for an address she told me we don't have one for you to visit. The office manager said she would have Carlos contact us and let him know it was urgent. We never received a call back from Carlos.

Moral of the story is the technician lied to us. The company apparently does not have an office. The office manager wasn't willing to follow through with what we were promised. And finally, Carlos the owner, who apparently is also a field technician, didn't care enough about retaining clients to make a phone call and do the right thing, or to hear that he has a technician out there lying to his customers about services be completed, and guarantees that the company apparently doesn't even offer.

"It was a perfect way for me to start the weekend.  Jen, my massage therapist, was fantastic.  She did a quick consultation before the session, asked me my preferences, my daily routine, and any impact areas.  First couple of minutes into the massage, she made quick adjustments to her technique to match my level of comfort.  After the massage, she gave me an assessment of what she noticed and recommended a course of action for the muscles.  Very impressed with the service.

"service.. slow/ slightly frantic. food.. amazing..went for brunch with a friend, sat outside and watched the live band play, as it was a beautiful Sunday. server came over and asked what we would like to drink. they have a section on their brunch menu for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys that i told my server i wanted to take advantage of. i started with a bloody mary before my meal, made with some clam juice which i was nervous about, but it was amazing. it did however take quite some time to get our beverages. when i ordered my second drink, a mimosa,as brunch came and it arrived when we were finishing our meal. we stayed for a while, as it was such a nice day and the band was great, empty glasses for quite some time and our server was mostly MIA. a guy was walking to all the tables quickly filling the glasses, but that never happened for us. normally i wouldnt care, but i was paying for bottomless brunch! we finally track her down and we asked for one more round and the check. she informs me that ""ill make this one bottomless"" and i told her i was confused bc i initially ordered that. she said ""well you cant mix and match. ehhh sorry"" i just wish she told me that sooner...like when i ordered my first mimosa. miscommunication i think. a different guy came over with his big pitcher, extra nice and gave me tall one,  when she brought over the check, she ended up fixing it so i wasnt paying extra which was really nice of her. we still enjoyed ourselves, however make sure when you go, you dont have any time constraints.

"First of all, I wasn't prepared to haggle over a gym membership like one would haggle over a car. But I did and I'm ok with it now. I nearly walked out of the place though while it was going on. 

The staff is alright I guess, I don't talk to them and they don't talk to me.

I enjoy it there, I go and do my own thing and that's how I like it. Even when it is crowded I still manage to find a machine to use and bide my time until one that I want opens up.

I think the bathroom area could be kept cleaner. The garbage always seems to be spilling over. Also, I've noticed that the paper towel dispensers were out of paper towels several times when I went to wipe down the machine I was on. Just gross lol.

Overall, its a nice place and I'll be sticking around.

First I'd like to say this is the crappiest place I've ever experienced we had my dad admitted on March 16th 2016 which was a Wednesday and he went there in the evening well they never gave him water in his room the only time we had water was when he took his medication he went from doing very well in his Rehabilitation to be a none coherent and because of the no water situation he became dehydrated which causes is kidneys to fail and by Saturday he was totally delirious I went on Sunday now this is in less than a week I had to call 911 and have my dad admitted into the Scottsdale Osborn Hospital where we found out that he had a heart attack that nobody noticed when we were there on Sunday before we had to call 911 Which Wich the call button for the nurse to come change the diaper that my dad had never used before yeah a diaper it took them 16 minutes before my sister went out to the front office or waiting area to find 3 employees sitting there 1 with their feet up on the desk and my sister asked if it usually takes this long for someone to come check on a patient that push the call button and her response was yeah at dinner time sometimes it takes longer and when we asked her about him falling out of the bed she responded with a giggle saying sometimes it happens well let me tell you I was livid my dad was dying if we would have left him there that day I honestly believe he would have died he had a heart attack and they didn't even know he had no water for 5 days I thank God everyday that we didn't leave that night that we called 911 for two days thinking my dad was going to pass away now he is back to normal or his normal but I wouldn't tell anybody to take their family members to this hell hole I feel sorry for all the people that are there they treat you like s*** and as if you're incompetent when you are not incompetent like my dad says they treated him like he was a baby and he's a grown man yeah he needs a little assistance instead of coming in the room they would yell at him through the speaker I know I'm going on and on but I wouldn't tell anybody to put their loved ones in this place I just thank God again that my dad is alive and with us so people please do not put your loved ones in this facility unless you want them to be in danger real Danger my name is Stacy Richards and I love my dad and the other reason I got one star is because I had to put it in order to put this review out but I would give it a -10 Stars,1.0
"This review was also posted to their Facebook page. Putting one star so people can see there are still hour long wait times for breakfast. 

My three children and I had brunch here yesterday to celebrate Mother's Day early and try to skip the crazy restaurant crowds Vegas usually has on holidays. We were seated at 11:30, ordered our food at 11:35 and we were served at 12:31!!! Thank goodness my three children are extremely well behaved, even though my two year old was understandably getting anxious. While we were sitting there quietly and obviously upset with three frowning, hungry children, nobody approached us to apologize for the wait until 47 minutes of waiting (by this point I started checking my watch). At 51 minutes, the manager came by to apologize for the wait as well because they were ""really busy"". There were eight tables total in my area and only 2/8 of those tables were served their food. The table next to me that finally got their food were waiting as long as we were. 

There was another customer who made a big stink about the wait and got up to leave a couple of times but his wife stayed behind so he and his son eventually came back and were finally served their food. The manager spoke to him apologizing a few times and then I hear that customer got a 20% discount to ""make up for the wait"" but myself nor the other customers sitting next to me got that same discount. Because we were being polite and waiting patiently? That's really unfair. I would never ask for a discount for a long wait time but to not be offered one because I didn't make a big scene about it isn't fair at all. 

The Kailua location was one of our family's favorite places to go when we were living in Hawaii. After seeing the mixed reviews when this place first opened, I held off on visiting for a few months to give them time to work out their kinks but a 50+ minute wait for breakfast food is unacceptable. I just saw other reviews from over three months ago complaining about the same thing and it's an issue that still isn't fixed yet. Go to Baby Stacks if you want great food and quick service. They constantly have lines out the door but you will never wait more than 20 minutes for your food.",1.0
"If I could have given no stars, I would have. I called this place 3 times after realizing they had towed my car from my apartment complex (due to parking lot repaving). On the third call, someone finally answered, but was completely confused as to why I was calling, and said that I had not reached a towing company. I have records of these calls and that I was dialing the correct phone number in my phone - even the woman at the towing company did not contest this. 

I was also unable to location my car via any online towing database 10 hours after it was towed. This was despite entering the VIN and Lic plate numerous times on numerous tow-finder websites. In order to locate my car I had to call the Henderson Police Department and be connected to Ashely Towing - via the same number I had called three times the previous evening. By the time I had located my car and gotten to Ashely's towing lot, they had charged me a storage fee. I asked a series of questions trying to get to the bottom of 1) why I was unable to reach Ashely's towing company the previous evening (I was told the manager was working at the time I called), and 2) why I was unable to locate the car online. At the end of this  exchange, when I had paid in full and after I had confirmed the PD reporting times with the Henderson PD, I was handing back the last signed itemized receipt to the customer service woman when she called me a b**** and launched a personal, verbal attack. This personal attack came unprompted after I handed her back the signed itemized receipts as requested. This incident was excessively inconvenient and stressful, beyond the normal car towing experience. The customer service and business practices were unacceptable. I am minimally recommending that my apartment complex not use this towing company again.",1.0
"This is a very interesting and different experience here in Cleveland. Glass shaping is fascinating and almost magical, but the few hour class offered here shows you that it is an art form that is as easy (and as hard) as working with clay or paint. 

The class offered is meant to be for a small group. I mention this because it is not apparent on their site or coupon that this is the case. If you pay for a ""class"", they mean a block of time for a small group, not per person. 

That being said, I did this just as an individual and still enjoyed it tremendously.

As a home schooler, I would say this would make a fabulous art lesson. I know I will be making plans to bring my kids in. It would also make a great family outing in the winter (it is toasty in there). I would recommend it for kids 10 and up and who are able to follow directions.

"Came in for a bite before doing some grocery shopping at Whole Foods (I know, I know..pizza and WF sounds contradictory). 

They are doing lunch specials where you get a 6inch 2 topping pizza and a drink for $6.85.You can add fries or onion rings for $1 or a side salad for $2 and some change. 

We added on the onion rings and those came out pretty fast. Not bad, but a tad cooked too long so it was on the harder side of crunchy. 

BF and I got to share one with salami and jalapenos and one with meatballs and olives. The crust was crunchy and it came out piping hot and quick. It's ""kinda"" Detroit style, more inspired I feel, a bit different than what I actually can get in Detroit. What it reminds me more of is the deep dish my elementary used to make. That's not meant to be a bad thing- my school made fresh (not packaged Tony's frozen) squares with pepperoni bits and I thought that was the best thing ever.

It was a nice throwback to my school days, was decent of a lunch meal at a good price, but it isn't my preferred deep dish around.

"I will never be coming here again after time chance after chance customer service went down the hell I was a loyal customer sense they opened, in 2015 I've spent so much money here to be treated poorly from workers talking in their language badly about me and would complain if I had something fixed or changed I know they spoke badly about me or my sister because I used Siri translate, lately the people who had been very rude was Rachel and David Jennifer was okay the manager, until she started changing up the prices on me or people I brought to the salon like she charged 10$ just to remove my mothers gel polish and put another gel when she got a refill or just because she filed them down she charged 5$ extra just because shape but it looked the same just a little shorter , everything extra I went from paying 18$for a full to paying 35$ I might as well of gotten a new set I'm not sure why she was trying to take money like that I have not seen the owner but would love to speak to her,and ask why , I went from loving this place to hating it the only person that has never had issue is christy she is always so nice, my last straw was when My friend made an appointment for me and my sister and her we changed it from 4:30 to 5 and Jennifer called and changed it for us till 5:30 and we got there on time and she said she can't take us only 2 people then she changed it to only 1 person that is not right she has always done this to me were I make an appointment and she takes other customers that have no appointment before Us. Anyways Rachel would always get mad if I got long nails or say negative comments same as David they should be able to take criticism not be rude.

"My husband and I ordered a couple of recliners from this store in November.  We paid 1/2 up front and received a call from the owner a couple weeks later saying that one of our recliners was in but that the other one was sent to the wrong warehouse and wouldn't arrive until January.  My husband did pick up the recliner that was in but we're pretty sure we were given the floor model because the chair looks worn and also has a pretty bad squeak. The owner did deliver the 2nd recliner to our house when it arrived in January, but we weren't offered any kind of reimbursement for having to wait 2 months.  My husband did call the owner to let him know about the squeaky recliner and was told that he'd have to bring in the recliner so the manufacturer could provide us with a new one.  We didn't want to go through the hassle because we figured we'd have to wait another 2 months for a new recliner.  The owner was nice but I'm not sure that I'd ever buy furniture from this store again.  Most people do not want 2 months for their furniture to arrive and I felt the owner could have done more to compensate us for our troubles.",2.0

Knee pads were a good idea and I'm glad I didn't have to see how much protection they would give me in a crash.  I got trail info and a couple of routes that would suit me.  The bike was set for me and adjusted really well.  I hadn't ridden a soft tail but it worked great, a  29er.    The directions to the trails gave me the lay of the land and a chance to gain back my bike skills.  I haven't ridden in a month and then only on the flatlands of the gulf coast.  
It took a while  to get to the top but I had a great afternoon getting familiar with the bike and the trails.  Glad I had a map and my gps as I would have got lost.  Great time.   I'd come back here and rent again.  Maybe next time my son in law and I can check out the trails.",5.0
"This restaurant has been up and coming for quite a while now; Even undergoing a beautiful remodel.  Loyal white haired neighborhood patrons flock to breakfast, and dinner mostly.  Based on recent experiences with my family, their service is sub-par at best, unfortunately.  ""Just sit anywhere you can find a table"", the young pretty woman said on our most recent visit.  After fifteen to twenty minutes of waiting with no server, no one busing the previous customers half drank Bloody Mary glasses, we decided to call it quits.  On the way out, we overheard an older gentleman say he was two minutes from leaving and cooking himself some food.  The Pinnacle Grille has good food, but inconsistent service.  A message to the owners:  If you expand your business, you must be better prepared; Your service staff and management is unprepared to match the quality of your food.  It's time to regroup.",2.0
"The salon I usually go to was closed and I was anxious to get my hair cut so I went here.  Have you ever sat down to get your hair cut and the person just starts cutting your hair without even asking you what you want done???  Neither had I until I came to this place.  I had a way overgrown pixie and wanted to trim it and clean it up with intentions of growing it out, but she just went to town as soon as I was in her chair.  I am pretty laid back about my hair so since she was already cutting, I just went along with it stupidly trusting she knew what she was doing.  I asked immediately after she started cutting, ""So, are you just giving me a shorter version of what I already have?"" to which she replied, ""I am point cutting it.""  So this lady didn't even answer my question, she just told me the method she was using to butcher my hair.  This woman was going SO FAST(no one was waiting to be serviced) and we were actually talking about what I wanted WHILE she cut it.  She managed to cover up the sloppy job by using a lot of product.  It wasn't until I got home and washed my hair that I saw how uneven and jacked up my pixie was.  I have NEVER in my LIFE had a worse hair cut (except maybe when I was 12 and my mom decided to experiment on my hair with a regular pair of craft scissors).  Lesson learned.",1.0
"My husband and I are from California, but were in Mississauga for a wedding. Our flight flew in late and by the time we got to our hotel we were hungry. Moxie's happened to be right across the street from where we were staying, so we decided to eat there. 

By far, one of the BEST steak dinners we've ever had! Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and they cut like butter! The garlic mashed potatoes and veggies were so good!

So being in the mood and willing to give them another try, I visited the West Charleston Location. Wow! Disgusting! The service was good, but the food was horrible. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was solidified and didn't compare to years past. The potatoes themselves were dry and powdery. The Cole Slaw was actually the best thing we had there. The chicken was greasy and didn't compare to years past. The Mac & Cheese was horrible! Some of the worst I've ever had. The Ranch dressing was again the worst I've had. The place was very dirty and messy. The outside lights were left off and it was night time which made it difficult to know if they were even open.

"This store is only a hop with no skip and jump away from me. You would think I'd be a grateful  person living so close to a market, but no! The parking lot is a disaster. I saw a woman right in front of me break her hip trying to walk to her car, and fell on the cement parking block. Paint those things would ya? The grocery carts are probably my biggest complaint. Why can't you have the small two tiered ones that they have at Walmart and Competitors? The answer I got when talking to a store manager was: because people steal them! No kidding! That's called a business loss and a tax write off. Or do what other stores have done in places like Las Vegas, put monitors on them where the wheels lock when rolled off the property. I live in Sun City, and yes we have lots of Great Grandmas and Dads so get over it! The aisles are not big enough for the giant carts, scooters, walkers, and canes. It would be so less wasteful if produce would pre cut half a cauliflower, squash, and other bigger veggies and fruits. The employees in the front of the house are very nice, but the deli and pharmacy is atrocious. They are not the pharmacy gods or the deli princesses, they are Kroger employees and should honor their policies.",2.0
"I don't go out for lunch too often anymore, but when I saw a $12.99 Indian buffet in Yorkville, I had to go in (I was actually going to just get a salad from Salad Days).  

While the selection isn't large, they still had a very good salad bar, 10-12 hot items, soup and some dessert.  There is definitely a focus on quality here as opposed to quantity.  

-Fresh naan bread
-Bean masala was excellent
-I can't comment on meat since I don't eat it on weekdays, but they had butter chicken, goat curry, and tandoori chicken but they all smelled very nice.  
-Even the salad was well dressed.

In addition, they have a loyalty card.  Have 5 meals and your 6th meal is free.

"How does one start their Centennial revue? Which venue does one choose to mark the occasion? How many other factors can possible come together to make this the hardest revue of my Yelp career?

...and will I ever be able to regain my sanity?

I am told that a great work of art is never truly finished, that the work never ends. After just one visit to Soho Japanese Restaurant, I now understand what that means.

Clearly the great Yelpers of Las Vegas have collectively cried out the praises of this understated little gem in the southwest valley. Not only does it rank top among sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it ranks tops among ALL restaurants in Las Vegas. That little tidbit has to be making some of this town's ""legendary"" chefs red in the face. Someone should tell those people at Michelin they are dinosaurs - no wait, never-mind, let them figure it out.

You see when it comes down to it, it's quite simple - if you do something great, people will notice. And it's clear, Soho does great better than anyone in Vegas.

The first thing you notice when you walk into Soho is that no world renowned restaurant decor consultancy group was brought in to ""class the place up"", like they do in most 5 star restaurants. Soho is a simple, friendly, comfortable and welcoming environment - a 5 star restaurant that won't make you feel like you're not good enough to be there (what a concept.)

The staff are regular people, just like you and me. But management is obviously treating these people with a little respect because it's quite clear they all love working there - it shows in absolutely everything they do. Imagine great service at a 5 star restaurant from friendly people who don't look down their nose at you (are you guys starting to see a trend here?)

But you really don't appreciate how good you have it until the food arrives. It's easy to get so comfortable here that you can forget you are about to partake in one amazing meal. All that changes once you take the first bite. For us it was the Uni Trio - just Wow! (Thank you sir, may I please have another.)

I know what you're thinking, what does a boy who grew up in Fargo, North Dakota know about sushi? Wouldn't he be dead last on the list of people you should trust on the subject? (Hey Buddy, you forgot to cook this!) 

Fair enough.

The truth is, you're just going to have to decide for yourself. No amount of banter from me is going to change your mind,so I'll leave that up to the marvelous people at Soho, they are better suited to the task. 

Whew! One hundred down, and ready for round two. Go Yelp!",5.0

"My friend and I decided to have a girls night out and picked Smoke. This review will have 2 parts. Food, and management aspects.

First the food. During our insane wait in the packed but small waiting area, one of the diners came out and offered us (the waiting public- now friends because we had bonded) her bag of chips. Most of us were 1-2 drinks in and were ready to eat our coats, so we snagged the chips. The magical, incredible chips. When we were seated we had another cocktail. These drinks are fantastic and incredibly mixed using flavors such as lavender, blackberry and cucumber. The queso- unique and divine. The tacos? Ridiculously fresh and fabulous. We had a beef and a chicken and I can't pick which was better because they were both incredible. The mac&cheese was so rich and delicious but we were both too stuffed to eat much of it. So for food and drinks Smoke scores at the absolute top.

If the operations at Smoke ran smoothly they would be overrun with patrons and they would have to open other locations because they are that good. That being said, here is my perception of our visit. First, the piece of paper on the door that says SMOKE was not visible from the street, so we drove past it 4 times. Here's the deal- there are too few people working and when they come back from the employee area (which should be used for seating-seriously) they are inefficient. 2 girls were trying to deal with an inefficient seating system, juggling phones, getting drinks, wiping tables, taking names, and dealing with people checking on where they were on the list. We were seated after about an hour, but according to the text system we weren't supposed to be seated until 7 minutes before we left. It's a hot mess. So call before you get there to put your name in. Call when you are parking. Call when you are walking in the door. Then enjoy some awesome drinks and food!",4.0
"Gordon Ramsey is such a hostile perfectionist I presumed his food would be top quality or at the very lease better than mediocre. The first thing I noticed upon entering was the smell of grease and fries and fish bubbling away in vats of grease. Pretty disgusting, so hubby placed his order and I decided I didn't need to drink grease. I just couldn't muster the ??? needed to order all that grease. Out of curiosity, I did try some of hubby's fish, on the soggy side, soggy with grease... and pretty bland, like flavor drowned out by grease. I'm glad I didn't part with cash for grease here, but if your diet lacks grease or you really have been taking healthiness too far lately, have a go at it.",1.0
"**updated review Feb 2017**
I've been here a handful of times now and there are a few hiccups that are constant. The service is awkward at best. One man in particular is not very friendly and he isn't helpful about the menu items. He also
stands to the side and watches you eat
to see when he should come by to get your plates. I feel a little uncomfortable eating while somebody is standing across the way staring at me. 
The other thing is that the inside of this restaurant smells weird, I don't know if it's sewage or a particular chemical they use to clean the inside of the place but it smells really bad. Kind of hard to have an appetite when you're in a place that reeks.
I do want to support this good cause, but if they could get their staff more properly trained in addition to the stench gone that would be really good.

I love this place and I love the concept! Eating and giving to those in need are two of my favorite things! I see so many cool places pop up and then vanish in this town...I truly hope this place makes it for a loooooong time!

"I sent my husband to numerous Mark Taylor properties while was in Arizona on a job interview.. He narrowed it down to San Lagos and San Prado. He ultimately decided on San Prado because the office staff made him feel welcome and San Lagos(only a block away) was far too large of a community. I only ever saw the images on the computer and we all know sometimes what you see isn't what you get. We were living in North Carolina so everything was handled over the phone and  via e-mail. Kristin was beyond helpful throughout the process and was very welcoming when we arrived to get our keys. I didn't know that there was a college across the street and when we arrived I was wondering what we had gotten ourselves into. Though you would never know you were across from a college campus because there is no noise issues(besides the occasional slam of the door or car alarm).

When we moved in there were a few things missing and within a day the maintenance guys came by and fixed those issues. A neighbors water heater broke and soaked our master bedroom floor and they came immediately and even had someone come out to clean the floor. Our water heater was acting up and within an hour of calling ON A WEEKEND they were over to check it out and get our hot water back. 

The grounds are well kept, the amenities are amazing. We chose San Prado because of their no dog policy, because of the office staff, the amenities and how small the property is compared to others. 

Like any other apartment complex if you follow the rules and keep to yourself you will love it!",5.0

"My 100th review!  Woohoo.  Went to skinny fats for lunch today with some friends and we ordered a whole bunch of stuff to share.  I love the concept of this restaurant that separates healthy vs. happy (aka fatty) items on the menu.  They also have lots of juices and salads for the health conscious.  We ordered 3 things from the unhealthy menu and 1 item from the healthy side.  We got truffle fries, smotherload breakfast burritos, sirracha ahi tuna tacos (healthy) and the stewy Benedict.

The good:
Fries were yummy.  It goes well with the jalapeño ketchup.  The portion size is very generous.

Breakfast burrito - it had steak, sausage, peppers, potatoes and salsa on top.  It also has a delicious sauce that goes on top of the burrito.  It was very flavorful.  Again portion size is huge.  

The ahi tacos are individual orders.  We got 3 for 3 people to share.  It comes on a whole wheat tortilla.  When i first bit into it, I can tell that the fish is not that fresh.  But all the salsa, sauce, onions and mango masked the taste.  I guess youre supposed to eat it all together and not just taste the fish itself.

The bad:
I didn't really like the stewy benedict.  It was a huge biscuit with an egg on top, hence the benedict, and its smothered in a beef stew.  It was a little salty for me and there wasn't that much meat either.

Next time I come back I defintiely want to try more of their healthy options...especially the juices and not succumb to the bad influences of friends who wants to eat everything off the ""happy/fatty"" menu.",4.0

"I walked past this salon on my way to Little Italy  last week and decided that I needed a new summer haircut. I saw online that they have a 10% student discount on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays - every discount helps since I'm on a student budget. 

Nella, the owner, took me in as a walk-in on a Wednesday, which I really appreciate - I think it was just luck that she had an open time slot before the next appointment. I would recommend making an appointment ahead of time to be on the safe side.

I showed Nella a picture of the new hairstyle I was aiming for, and she went right to work. I basically wanted about three inches chopped off on the ends and to add some texture and layers throughout. I had a very pleasant conversation with her the entire time, and I learned that she knows quite a lot about Little Italy and some of its history. She is very friendly, professional and a joy to talk to, and most importantly, I am very happy and satisfied with my new haircut.  The cost of the haircut was $18 - perfect for my budget.

Overall, the place was clean and cozy, and I would definitely recommend Nella to anyone looking for a great haircut for a great price.",5.0

"While checking out the Eaton Centre yesterday over my lunch hour I thought I'd try and get some holiday shopping done.  Well, that turned out to be an epic fail and since I was hungry, I thought I may as well grab lunch while I was there.

The new Urban Eatery is probably one of the coolest ""mall food courts"" I've seen in a long time.  After walking by numerous spots, I decided on Rare.  

Rare is a sandwich shop, located at the north west end of the Urban Eatery.  Their freshly made rare beef sandwiches are prominently featured on their menu, however, they also offer chicken, turkey and vegetarian sandwich options on their Expresss Daily Sandwiches.  All of their sandwiches are served with soup or salad. 

I ordered the Pico (pico de gallo, caramelized onions, and bell peppers, lime-spiked crema, monterey jack and of course rare roast beef) with a quinoa salad.  Ordering was fairly easy and as I watched the sandwich girl make my sandwich I couldn't help but think ""that's a lot of beef!""  Now, in stark contrast to the beef portion was the sad tablespoon and a half of quinoa salad they threw into the take out salad bowl.  The salad bowl was tiny to begin with, but the fact that they don't even fill the salad ""cup""...honestly, it was not even 1/3 full!  I was really disappointed because the salad was delicious...quinoa with cranberries, apple pieces and a sesame oil dressing...delicious, but sadly the microscopic serving size left me both wanting more and resenting them for giving me such a teensy tiny portion.

The star attraction, the beef sandwich was DELICIOUS.  The fresh rare roast beef had been thinly sliced and quickly dipped in an au jus before being placed on the whole wheat bun and then topped with all the ingredients mentioned above.  THEN, once assembled was put in a panini press to heat it up for a few minutes and perfectly melt the monterey jack cheese. What can I say, it was a rare roast beef sandwich symphony.

As delicious as the sandwich was, I still can only bring myself to give it 2 stars...with a total price tag of $10.11, without a drink, I kind of felt a bit of wallet rape anxiety after the insult of consuming my 1 1/2 tablespoons of quinoa salad.  The sting is still there.",2.0

"I'm going to make this one short and sweet. Place was kind of clean. Better than most but not immaculate. The manager seemed inexperienced to be a general manager. Kind of kept staring at me and not talking. You think he would make suggestions. Anyway, after I ordered my friends burger and mine. It took a total of 12 minutes.  Bear in mind our ticket was the only one on the expo board....?? Fast food?? That's why we come here because it's fast not amazing.

Really discouraged because I waited there for a while and a cashier, shift leader and general manager all just stood there and stared at the one cook on. You think they would help her because clearly two burgers was a task. How are you a lead or a manager if you don't jump in when your employee is sinking on one ticket?! Red flag

NEVER GET THE TERIYAKI BURGER. This was the worst burger I have had since living here in Nevada. I even asked my boyfriend to try some and he said ""I don't even want to finish chewing it."" This is a man who can put down mostly everything. 

The burger didn't even taste cooked and was not that hot. The amount of mayo and Teriyaki sauce on it was disguising. Both sauces were like ice cold. My bread was actually soggy from it. One leaf of lettuce and 8 rings of onions. I feel like that isn't SPEC at all. From staff watching their own cooks sink, to the worst burger ever I will never be back here, yet to this company alone.

"Somehow this food court gem manages to exceed it's environment, and has earned a well deserved prize from me of being the only food court restaurant I would ever consider eating at, going to again, and tell my friends about.

This is a magnificent feat considering, as I said, that this is a food court restaurant.

Plates are big, with lots of fresh fruit, and really healthy conscious. Good food, well priced.",4.0
"Simply put, Gossamer Salon & Grooming Co. is amazing!  Everyone is super-friendly and super-talented. Especially Selena, the owner. I've been a happy client for almost 15 years and even after all this time Selena always has fresh, fun ideas to keep me looking great. My daughters are clients and Selena styled their hair for their weddings including the attendants. Of course everyone looked fabulous!

I love the feel of the salon which is edgy but elegant. I love the location too. 

I highly recommend the salon to everyone I know.",5.0
"Ok, I walked in at 7:30pm and had to wonder whether they were open.  No hostess! So I walked in and stood at the bar for nearly a minute before I skated if they were open.  Finally some service!!!  Let me say that the drinks are fantastic!  The food not so much.  The rating is only due to the drinks.",3.0
"I'm honestly not sure why this salon has good ratings. I went here with hair that had not been colored in ten years. I thought I would be safe by going to a professional hair stylist but I was very wrong. All I wanted was for my hair to be highlighted and layered. The woman I talked to over the phone seemed like she was trying to be nice but when I asked questions about pricing and the hair treatment, she seemed annoyed and like she didn't have time for me. I should have gone somewhere else at this point but I thought they must do good hair because they have good ratings. She assured me that highlighting is a basic thing that all the hair stylists are well trained in. I had Lanita as my hair stylist and I immediately noticed that there was hair all over the floor, it didn't look clean or prepared for my appointment. Once I sat down, I told her I wanted basic highlights and layers. I showed her a couple of pictures of what I was looking for and she told me that she could not copy someone else's work. She told me that doing foil highlights were ""out"" and I shouldn't get them. She then informed me that she was going to paint on the highlights and it would look great. I should have left then because she didn't want to give me what I asked for and she seemed a bit too pushy.  Unfortunately I let her do my hair, thinking she probably knew what she was talking about because she was the professional. She then painted on the highlights and let it sit for awhile. The entire time she was doing my hair she was checking her phone and gossiping with the other hairstylists. I didn't feel like my hair turning out well was a priority to her at all. After she washed the bleach out of my hair and I first saw it, I thought it didn't look too bad. Unfortunately I didn't realize that it looked darker than it was because it was still wet. She then cut my hair which seemed fine. After an alright cut, she blow dried it and complained about how long it was taking because I had so much hair. She told me she had a dinner to go to so she seemed like she was rushing. Half way through straightening my hair she told me she forgot to thin out my hair. She kind of gave me a woops attitude about it and didn't offer to fix it. Once I got in the car I noticed my hair was a copper orange color and the highlights made no sense. They were chunky in some areas and none existent in others. My bangs were saturated with coppery blonde while the back of my hair looked untouched. I paid wayyyyy too much for a hair nightmare and had to pay even more to go to a different salon and get my hair fixed. The stylist that fixed my color also ended up fixing the haircut because she saw that the haircut made no sence as well. Although I was excited about getting highlights, my new hair stylist had no choice but to dye it back to dark brown to get rid of all the uneven coloring in my hair. Lesson learned- do a lot of research on salons and stylists before letting someone touch your hair! Don't make the same mistake I did, go somewhere else!",1.0

"Great food, nice atmosphere. My sister and I stopped here on out way to a massage. Didn't know the area but saw this place next to the gas station we stopped at. Was not disappointed. They have breakfast all day, the food is fresh and made to order. Would absolutely come back!",5.0
"Our kitchen is torn apart, in the middle of a renovation. So last night, there we were again, hungry, and no way to cook. Delivery choices are limited in our area, unless you want pizza or Chinese. 

We were pretty burnt out on both. But decided to go for pizza. I sifted through our stack of menus, and came across one for a place we'd never ordered from - Nick's.

I was pleased to find that, in addition to pizza, they offered pasta dishes, hot and cold subs, salads, and cheesesteaks for delivery. Score!  We ordered a meatball sub, a cheesesteak, and a caesar salad. 

Delivery was fairly timely (way better than the 45 minutes Streets of New York delivery!). The goods were a pleasant surprise as well.

The caesar salad was HUGE! The round to-go container was jam-packed with romaine lettuce, parm, and croutons. Dressing was served on the side. Thank goodness for that, because we tucked right into the subs first, and were way too stuffed for salad afterwards. That left me with a huge salad to take to lunch the next day. 

The subs were on a soft on the inside, crusty on the outside roll. The meatballs were nice and juicy, and with good flavor. You could tell it was made with mixed meats (ideally, beef, pork, and veal), as a good meatball should be made. The cheesesteak, on the other hand, was OK. The meat was rather salty, but otherwise good. 

That tab wasn't too bad either - around $22. I would definitely order from them again.",4.0
"Bestbuy is gouging its customers on the taxes of cell phones. They are charging 38-40% by taxing the full retail price of the phone, not the price they received it for. Seems they are the only company doing that. I took the sales people and couple managers to task about it. They were absolutely stunned to see that not only could I read, I could also comprehend.

"I normally would give a 5 star but she does not even deserve a one star. Hair's My Paradise moved again with no notification to her loyal customers.

Now I know that next time I'm in Vegas, I won't even remember eating here, because I didn't order that gimmicky $30 burger.",4.0

"Stay away from this company!!!. Once you place an order and pay for it, then good luck getting your purchased item or your money back.

Norfinch location, I placed an order with sales person Chris, after one month following up with him for pick up, he told me that those items are discontinued and not available, I asked for my money back, he told me that I can only get store credit .

"This is more a 3.5 stars.  My first time here was about 2 years ago for a friend's bday.  She reserved the lounge area in the back.  My initial thought was this is a nice surprise (not expecting it from the look of the outside and being located at a strip mall). After that, we came often for happy hour or late night eats.  They have different daily specials and we usually come for $5 burgers on wednesdays.  The burgers are very filling but average/what you'd expect from the menu description.

The menu has some interesting dishes.  The grilled bella is a good small plate dish.  The caprese wrap is inconsistent.  I've had it better tasting than other times.  I have yet to try a large plate dish.

They have a good and extensive drink list and there's a lot of beers to try that's not found at other bars in town.  When we went last night, they were offering their seasonal drinks like the pumpkin martini that my friend had (it smelled and tasted delicious!).  Hubby and other friend had pumking with the cinnamon sugar rim. Since it has a lot of alcohol content and so easy to drink, they will come in a short glass.  They also tried other seasonal ipas, which they both liked.  They have good martinis as well (and only $5 during happy hr)

I'd say food is ok (sometimes inconsistent), drinks are the star at this place, service is also inconsistent with some servers being better than others. The women's bathroom needs some TLC. I don't think anyone watches it because sometimes there are no toilet paper or paper towels, and the soap dispensers were broken last night, which made me question if the servers went to the bathroom and hopefully had their own hand sanitizers.",3.0

"I'm not typically a picky eater when it comes to vietnamese food, but I'm going to come right out and say that this wasn't my favourite pho spot. 

The noodles were slightly under cooked, and the soup base was overly salty.

However, I will commend the restaurant on its clean decor, and appetizers. The spicy basil calamari and grilled skewers (specifically the beef and chicken) were delicious, and the complimentary taro chips that you get after ordering are a perfect snack to munch on while waiting for your food to arrive. 

WonderPho is a bit short of being wonderful in my books, but it'll do for a quick fix in the area.",2.0

"My wife and I treated my in-laws to a late morning breakfast one Saturday. It was crowded, but our wait was not long.  The place is quite small, so the seating is intimate so don't expect a lot of elbow room.  The staff is friendly; however they had hip hop blaring which came across like they were trying to be too hip.  Hearing DMX that time of the morning lends it more for evening drinks than a relaxing breakfast.

The food was eclectic, and not your typical breakfast fare.  We started with cinnamon toast and blueberry pop tarts.  The pop tart was delicious; however the toast was nothing you couldn't make at home.

My food was good. I had a small boule sandwich which included a runny egg, slab bacon and cheddar cheese. But it was $16 and the size of my palm. However my wife and mother-in-law found their chicken baguette and grits special quite bland.   My biggest concern about this place is value.

With that said, there is something about the traditional Mexican Chocolate Paleta that is downright addicting. Creamy, smooth, and just sweet enough without being too sweet. In my book, you also can't go wrong with the Arroz con Leite. My kids love the creamy fruit flavors, and if you're adventurous you might want to try the Pina con Chile (pineapple with chile powder).

The service is alway quick and friendly, and even though you're eating sweets its nice to know the ingredients are fresh and everything is made from scratch.

"I went to Top Golf on a Sunday night. I took my kids and we were all looking forward to trying it. We went to sign up for cards (our membership) and then get on the list for a bay. 

It was about 45 min wait which I did not believe was so bad. My kids and I went to the dining area and that is when things started to go downhill. We could not get anyone to serve us!. Servers walked by, I tried to get their attention and even though they said they would find our server no one came. Finally a nice girl I flagged down got us some drinks (apparently we were not in her section). Once we did get a server after about 20 min. we put in our order. Our bay was then available before the food came. The server said she would transfer it to our bay, food never came and our server at the bay had no idea about it. When we got to the bay, my card to turn on the game did not work.  

The strange thing is after about 15 min of being at the bay a server (not the one from downstairs) came up to me asked if I had transferred some food up and wanted to make sure she was not our server and wanted me to say it. There were two managers watching her with me and she seemed kind of scared. It was quite strange. 

Anyways, waited another 30 min between them looking for our food and then 'finding' it. It was tasty, I will give them that. I really wanted to like this place- and I do for golf.

The guac is the tha bomb. I couldnt get enough of it, although its very expensive, 8 bucks for a small mini dish and 15 for a larger dish. 

The tortilla soup, wasn't the tortilla soup I expected because I remember it being a clear broth and not spicy. They was like a chipotle puree and SPICEY! The server warned it was hot and boy was she right. I put some of the guac in my soup to cool it down. I dont think I would order this again just because it wasn't the tortilla soup I was looking for.

My husband LOOOOVED his burrito. He said its the best burrito, wrap, sandwich he has ever had. He could only eat half and we took the other half home.

My tacos, the tacos are considered appetizers but I was pretty full for some reason even though I arrived at the restaurant hungry. Thank goodness I didnt order two sets of tacos as I originally intended. Like I said I ordered the octopus and tuna taco. It was spicy and bursting with flavour. I only managed to eat one of my two tacos and took the other one home. I will try the other tacos next time just for variety but this was excellent.

The key points about this place is the food is crazy fresh, and their dishes are all bursting with flavour. We now have a new go to place for good food.",5.0
This spot was our savior during our stay at the Venetian.  Service was good and the food was good as well.  Killer salad dressing made from scratch and the pizza and pasta we ate was delicious.  I would come back even if I weren't staying at the Venetian!,4.0

Their chips and queso with chorizo are the best I have ever had! Their Bakersfield Margarita is also one of the best margaritas I've ever had. The atmosphere of the upstairs and downstairs bar are very cool and unique. They play old western movies on the TVs too!,5.0
"What a TERRIBLE experience!! DO NOT rent here!! First of all, they say they are at the main car rental area but NO.. So you have to take a 15 min plus ride to the main area and THEN you have to get another shuttle to a second location. That location is 15 min further away!! So when you finally arrive you are greeted by an insane line and only three people are helping customers. Not to mention it takes 10 min per person as they attempt to upsell the customer to the next car category. So finally you think your done right?? WRONG!! You take your paper and go to the lot guy and ask him which car is yours? His reply?? There was none!! He just walked off!! 3 min later he wonders back and oops they don't have my reserved car type so I can have that lower model instead. By this point I don't care, because I can see another line to drive your car off the lot. All told?? I arrived at 10am and drove off the lot at 11:30!!!
 It was just as incompetent on the return. No one was there to receive the car on my return and when I finally found a guy he signed my paper and sent me to the damn inside to ""cash out"" with the cashier. This was another 10 person line. Not to mention the two shuttles in reverse. I have NEVER had such a bad car rental experience and I will NEVER use this company again.",1.0

"I usually hope that I never have any Starbucks cravings while I'm here because both spots in the mall are by far the crappiest service ever. The barista making drinks gets mad at you if you ask for whipped cream on your drink because the one taking orders didn't mark it on your cup. Overall, each time I've been there it's always sour attitudes morning and night. Not to mention, they are really slow even when there is no line. If you're lucky, you might get that one new person who's smiley and provide great service but the rest are dreadful.",1.0
"You think a girl who lived in LA would have gone to a PF Changs, but I thought how good could a large chain joint be? When my boss took me here it was really nice looking but I hate places that are too dimly lit so we sat outside. It was nice because we were the only ones in the section. Literally my only complaint could be that the food took too long. It could be, but it won't be. Because when it was taking too long the waiter brought us a free appetizer, a delicious vegetarian lettuce wrap. Then they offered us a free dessert of our choice. I had ordered the chicken sate because that's what I get from everywhere. The chicken was so delicious but the peanut sauce was the best I have ever tasted, nothing else has even come close! I was licking the bowl and wishing it was twice as big. The only thing that I was disappointed by was every time I get this it comes with a cucumber salad and this one came with a regular tiny salad. It's a little pricey but we more than made up for it in free food and even without it it would have been worth it.",5.0
"Unfortunately most people are right on their review of this shop. I'm not sure why but it seems like a lot of shops at miracle mile are lacking inventory.

"This week was my 5th visit to this dealership for the same car alarm problem I have with my 2009 Traverse. It was great to drive it off their lot for the 5th time assured it was fixed and have it right back to you and me in a rental again no less than 2 hours later for the same Problem. Oh I also love the fact that it has had a multitude of other issues as well including faulty heated /cooled seats, fault airbag sensor, an oil leak in the engine, tire pressure system issues. They have had my car in there more than a month fixing various problems all stemmimg from an after market alarm that you installed. Even better I didnt need the after market alarm because there was already a factory installed alarm in the car that they didnt bother to mention.  If you bought a Chevy Traverse or Equinox from these people and you paid for an alarm that you may have thought was factory, please call them and inquire if you already had a factory installed alarm and if so demand its removal and a full refund before you expereince a range of electral and alarm issues. If you are about to buy one go to another dealership.",1.0
"This is a contender for best meal I've ever had.  Rick Moonen, I love you.

I did eat at RM Upstairs, and I did do the tasting menu, which is the best of the best they offer, but even the caviar taramasalata they bring with the bread is one of the best things I've ever put on a piece of bread.  

The vanilla spearmint oysters, the white gazpacho.... I think about these things on an almost daily basis.  I was absolutely blown away by the thought that goes into flavoring these dishes, and how sophisticated the person's palate is that conceived of these.  

Best part: After relishing the Chocolate Car Bomb desert, we were craving the real thing, and our wine server brought us an ACTUAL Irish Car Bomb.  Any high end restaurant that will serve you an Irish Car Bomb on a tray gets my vote.

Next time I desperately want to try the sushi bar downstairs. Until next time, Mr. Moonen.",5.0

"Vision Center Review ...
After shopping around and comparing prices at different stores I decided to purchase lenses for my current frames at Walmart. While comparing prices I was told at Walmart that they could put the medium weight lenses in my frames for $60 with a $10 fee for doing so. So I returned a few days later and the associate that helped me this time told me I could not put lenses in my frame because whoever fitted the lenses to the frame bent the frame and it would probably break. (They were from Walmart by the way) So instead I purchased some cheap frames and what I thought was the medium weight lenses. I have extremely bad eye sight and most companies will not sell me the thickest  lenses because I would not be able to see correctly with them and they would be very heavy and not fit in most frames. So I return two weeks later to pick up my new glasses and I have the heaviest thickest lenses in my new wire rim frames! I use to work at an eye doctor selling frames; thick lenses will not stay in wire rim frames! I told this sales associate that this is not what I ordered, I wanted to purchase the medium weight lenses, and that the other associates told me they were $60, She told me they were not they were $140, well before I was told the thinnest lenses were $140. Instead of correcting the order, having me pay the difference, and sending my glasses back to get them fixed she argues with me until I just give up and tell her to return them. I am not taking glasses that I would not be able to see out of, or that are going to break just because she cannot understand that the other sales  associate filled out the form incorrectly and was too busy answering phones and talking about cat's to get my order correct.  My boyfriend was with me when I purchased the glasses and he confirmed that he thought I was ordering the medium weight lenses as well, the problem was this woman did not know what she was selling or how to place an order. Now my eye glass prescription is expired and I have no glasses. I have been getting glasses for 23 years and this is the only time in my life this has happened to me. Worst experience I have ever had! Never go to the Vision Center in Medina go to Strongsville or something instead!",1.0
"Yummy nachos!!!!! i ordered the volcano nachos and when it came out all i could say was wow they were huge. My boyfriend and i couldn't even eat half of it, and we love to eat. We ended up taking the rest home and i couldn't even close the box it was so full. My boyfriend ordered the mushroom burger (we didn't know the nachos would be so big) it was pretty average burger. 
The service was great. If you don't like to be bother while you eat i don't recommend this place. There's loud music, guys and girls on stilts walking around making balloon animals, women in bikinis walking around trying to get you to donate to Save The Tatas, and a girl sliding down into a big margarita. Overall i had fun food was alright at best but the nachos are amazing. Of course they had really good margaritas...",4.0

"The Coney Island Emporium is a nice airy arcade up a floor from the main level of the New York-New York.  It has traditional manned carnival games, such as the ring toss.  In addition to the arcade games there are photo booths and other amusements.  There are plenty of change machines scattered throughout.  This is also where the entrance to the roller coaster is.

"And the award for official greasy spoon of Vegas goes to: Tiffany's in downtown Vegas.  

Why?  Because it's hard to find a true greasy spoon diner in Las Vegas.  Sure, there are places all over down that can put eggs on a griddle or serve up a greasy burger, but most are tucked away in a strip mall and few, if any, have a old time soda fountain counter for patrons to sit at.

The waitstaff is awesome and attentive.  The burgers aren't the greatest thing you'll ever taste, but remember this is a diner.  For a diner, they are serving up a quality burger with the just the right ratio of grease and cheese blended into the bun.  

If you've got time some morning, take a seat at the counter and have a simple, great breakfast off the griddle.  They do eggs right with some crispy bacon.  Thumbs up.

"Very good service. Friendly staff.

I got the Thai and vanilla twist in a cup. The Thai ice cream didn't have as much flavour as kekou gelato. I had a sample of the hojicha ice cream and found that to be delicious. Will be back to try their Asian flavours!

Limited seating. 

Some of their menu limits are made to order so it will take around 15 minutes. I got my soft serve right away.

"Decided to try this place when Partner was craving something spicy for dinner. I had only ever had Tibetan cuisine once before, at another restaurant on the same strip, and had loved it. This place was amazing: small enough to be cozy, but not hipsterish enough to be crowded. You can actually hear your conversation partner(s)! 

The hot ""sauce"" (more of a spice mix) on the table was dead serious. Partner said it was ""like voting for Obama and getting Al Sharpton."" Definitely wait for your drink to arrive before tasting it.

I had the crispy cauliflower (a must-try) and veggie momos (delish with sriracha and soy sauce). Partner got something with beef in it, which he loved; however there is a plethora of vegetarian options at this place.

Partner finished with some Tibetan tea, made with butter. He loved it, but I wasn't interested.

Service here was polite and prompt. I'd certainly go again, and bring a friend.

Only caveat is that there is a shrine to the Dalai Lama in one corner, which would make me hesitant to bring a super-religious person here.  That being said, I will certainly come back.",4.0
"Shop and Staff 

   This shop is very well maintained. Both times I have been to the shop I noticed the floors were clean, tables were clean, and the stock was full. Being inside of a busy airport it is nice to see how clean everything feels. I love this place for the food they offer. I have posted a few pictures of the items I buy and they are the best things to eat. Both times now I've seen Nicole Koch. She is very nice, talkative, and respectful. I really enjoy talking to her because she encouraged me to buy the items I got hooked on. If she didn't talk to me or suggest which items to try I never would of known the tasty treats this store has to offer. 

 Food and Experience

   The thing that got me hooked to this place was the fruit, nut, and nougat bars. They are very good. The other things I really enjoy are the sliced meats rolled with cheese. I would have to recommend theses two things although they also have really good chocolate as well. Can't wait till next time.",5.0

"Our office moved downtown a few years ago and this place is just a block away from University Avenue.  I admit, I enjoy fine food, but I also have a taste for the more pedestrian.  I guess when it comes to Chinese food, I enjoy haute fusion cuisine, but I also have cravings for food drowned in red sweet & sour sauce.  

Hong Shing is closer to the latter.  Their menu will never be confused with the likes of Blowfish.  It's pretty standard stuff, but damn, it's good standard stuff.  I really enjoy their crispy honey beef, shrimp rolls, wonton soup in a great broth and general tao chicken.  I have never enjoyed hot & sour soup until I tasted theirs.  (An influencing factor may have been a severe cold which plugged my nose and taste buds.  But I still love it to this day and my sinuses are clear!!)

What they haven't seem to master yet are noodle dishes.  Their cantonese chow mein is drowned in what looks like placenta.  (Sorry, was that gross?)

If you are not turned off by dining tables with several inches of additiional height from layers of disposable plastic table clothes, you'll enjoy the food.  The staff is mostly friendly with a few curt staff, but I think that's more cultural than anything.  If you see police officers there, don't worry, there's ofent police officers there picking up food.",4.0
"On a vacation to Cleveland from Los Angeles, I was in need of new highlights and touch up color at the roots. I went to see Melanie and she gave me the prettiest highlights that I have ever had. She has an amazing eye. She picked the perfect golden color for me. Then she weaved the highlights in so expertly that nobody has even noticed that I had highlights done at all! This is big for me. Very important. I like that it looks natural. 
She also gave me the exact cut that I asked for, and lots of advice on growing longer and stronger hair. There is no way that I am going back to my LA salon... I feel that I will look and feel better if I just wait until my next trip to Cleveland to get my hair done at Sisu.

"Never have I ever been laid... Oh it's Lei'd? Or Lei-yed? I don't know for sure but I like it! 
Bahama Breeze hosted a fantastic event filled with great food, entertainment, and refreshments (by refreshments I mean alcohol!). 
I had the pleasure of sitting next to Bethany E, who I've been virtual friends with since first moving to Vegas and 4 years later I get to sit next to this beauty! Also, the hilarious Des B, Allison B who have been dating since high-school, in case you didn't know... AND the lovely Geselle R. Great company always makes for a better meal.
Now on to the food, a menu and a welcome cocktail were a nice touch. We were all able to follow the menu and prepare for the next dish. 
The appetizers included Jackfruit Tacos, Crab Stack, and Curry Goat. The crab stack was my favorite. Aside from harboring deep love for seafood, mango and corn in the stack made the dish super refreshing and light. The jackfruit tacos were pretty refreshing as well, sweet and surprisingly hearty. The curry goat was yummy as well. It was served over a bed of rice in a cute mug like dish. 
Main Dishes included: Taste of Jamaica, Jamaican Staffed Plantain, Jerk Chicken Pasta. I was honestly full from the appetizers but of course proceeded to try everything due to innate greediness... Ugh, if I only didn't love food so much... 
Anyhoo, The taste of Jamaica included rice, bean, sweet plantains, jerk chicken, pork, and the best empanada ever. It was so freaking delicious. My favorite in the dish were the plantains, pork, and the bomb empanada. 
The stuffed plantain was pretty good as well, I could not dissect exactly what was in it but it was pretty good! It definitely had rice and beans.
The jerk chicken pasta was creamy and a bit spicy. Bow-tie pasta dressed with jerk chicken, mushrooms, asparagus, and cheese - yum!
For desert we were spoiled with Key Lime Pie. Though I was beyond stuffed, I managed to eat more than half... Everyone else seemed to be packing it to go. I however, decided to challenge myself and succeeded! - at being stuffed like a San Diego burrito. 
I also had the pleasure of trying the margarita sampler. Such a great option for those that have difficulty making a choice. It came with Strawberry, Hibiscus, and Tamarind margaritas. Strawberry was my fave.

"I don't really understand the hype about this place, maybe super greasy burgers are just not my thing. I think I just ordered the Jr. Cheeseburger, it was like the simplest, smallest, least intimidating thing on the menu, so I figured I would get to enjoy the taste of the high quality, organic beef without the distraction of all the fancy fixings. The beef was super thick and juicy, it's true, but honestly it was like eating 50% beef and 50% oil... hands down greasiest burger I have ever had. By the time I got to the last few bites, my burger was just this squished, compact, solid chunk of beef and bread with grease oozing out of it. I might give this place another try in the future just because some of the other burgers sound really interesting and I am intrigued (foie gras burger... at a hefty $30) but honestly, unless you're planning to order one of their more unique menu items, I wouldn't come into this place with super high expectations; in their purest form their burgers are nothing worth raving about and you might just be let down.",2.0

What's not to love about $5 create your own bloody marys and GRANDE mimosas???  Thankfully the food itself was great too and extremely reasonable. I had the carne asado omelet with the green chili biscuit on the side (the biscuit itself is worth going back for, nothing less than amazing).  Hubby had habanero benedict which he raved over.  Both were $9.  I was expecting very small portions or sub-par food for the prices, but didn't get either and was very pleasantely surprised.

"This is my second visit to this Autozone location and I'm unimpressed and disappointed.

It's probably nice for those in the neighborhood to have bilingual cashiers. However this also made it extremely difficult to understand what their recommendations were.

I came in for advice on a battery for a car FOB and to ask about replacing the shell for my custom auto-start device. I waited in line behind two other customers at the only open register. Another customer waited behind me. The cashier greeted each of us and replied he would help us shortly.

I'm patient and understand they're understaffed. However, it was upsetting when the other cashier appears and instead of helping me, now clearly the next customer in line) he helps a man standing closer to him. I felt disrespected as both a customer and woman.

The cashier's line I was in even apologized and tried to explain that I was next to his colleague. I guess cashier number 2 didn't care bc he never even glanced over at me. 

Either way, cashier #1 couldn't understand what exactly I was asking and by the time I explained, I realized I needed to go to the experts. 

I don't think I will ever return to this location because my previous experience involved being ignored for long periods of time as well.",2.0

"I've lived in the area for quite some time now but never made it in to this restaurant until just last week.  I had not idea what I was missing!  The food is absolutely delicious.

Try the Chilli Paneer (dry) as a specialty appetizer - it was just amazing.  We went with an Asian palatte rather than Indian, and they suggest its better not to mix the two flavours but you can if you want to.  And all the dishes were so good.

And don't forget about dessert.  I'm not a fan of chocolate cate, normally..  but we had some kind of chocolate fudge with ice cream that was so soft and tasty I couldn't get enough.

Hands down, I will be going back here and regularly.  The quality is top notch, the service is great, and most importantly the food is just incredible.  If you have not been here, give it a try you won't regret it.

"This is my favorite spot to have lunch, by far!  Everything we have ordered is fresh and tastes great.  The burgers are fantastic.  I'm not sure, but I think they use a blend of different cuts of meat and I think even a little pork.  The flavor of the meat is just too good to be regular hamburger alone.  Even the chicken fingers are worth getting every time you go.  There is nothing frozen about anything we have ordered there.  The one thing I can say negative is that it does tend to take a little longer to get our food than other places, but I can honestly say that it is well worth the wait because we know that it will be great.  If it takes a couple of minutes longer to make a great burger, then I am all for it!  I know the place doesn't look like much on the outside, but they have done a great job of decorating and making it look and feel like a great place to hang out on the inside.  It is extremely clean on the inside....I am really picky about that.  Everyone I I take there is pleasantly surprised, when they walk through the door. They have a pool table, shuffleboard, TV's to watch the game, and I believe video slots at the bar (I don't gamble, so I can't say I know for 100% sure).

"We've been back a couple more times, the food has been hit or miss, but the service has really gone down hill. They perpetually have a Groupon offer, but after the last time we went, the group decided it wasn't worth the prices, even with the Groupon.",2.0
"I have to say, this place is so convenient and has great customer service.  I've now stopped in twice and was helped out immediately. Which includes helping me lift my 65lb bike in and out of my car.  I have my own bike, but the rented bikes appear to be in good condition, and based on the service I received I would believe that they are well maintained.  They also carry a wide variety of accessories for your bike that are reasonably priced and fashionable.  

This is definitely my new go-to stop for beach cruiser maintenance and bling!",5.0
"Imagine the worst experience ever, these guys are that x10. Doing drugs on the job, check. Breaking my stuff, check. Doing an awful job, check. Had to ask them to leave. The following day the cleaner somehow found out where I work and started calling my office dozens of times. They showed up 6 hours late, and up charged me 3x the voucher cost. 2 days before Christmas no less. If you've worked the jokers and had a similar experience please post a review. This type of business is unacceptable.",1.0
"I would rate this place a 5, but it gets pretty noisy. It was difficult to hold a conversation with my date. But, when my entree was served, I no longer cared. I ordered the slow-roasted maple duck (or something like that) and every bite was more and more delicious (dare I say orgasmic?). I savored that bird, piece by piece. My date had the ahi tuna. It was good, but it didn't compare to the duck - which was the first time I had ever tried such an entree - sprinkled with fresh peppercorns!

I'd like to go back soon. I've had duck other places, but it just doesn't compare. Would I order anything else if I went? Probably not. The duck was JUST that spectacular.",4.0
"I recently bought a used vehicle. Lee Bommer was instrumental in helping me and did a bang up job. If I hadn't had to use the maintenance service I would have given the dealership 5 stars. As it was, I lost 5 days of travel time waiting for a part that I was told had been ordered that never seemed to have arrived. The vaunted 124 point check system somehow missed a bad battery, causing me to have to jump start the car two days in a row and the check engine light to come on the next day. Needless to say, I took the car back and had them fix before driving a long distance. Then once I had completed the long distance drive, the check engine light came on again. Good thing I purchased an extended warranty on the vehicle. I pray now that I haven't gotten a lemon.",3.0

"We gave the place a try on a Friday night, early.  It was still Happy Hour, but a goofs time to bring in a toddler.  It's a noisy place, with hard surfaces abounding ... But we view that as a plus with a toddler; they tend to do better in noisy places!  Service was very attentive, very efficient, and QUICK!  We had a very short wait for our apps, and the dinner came soon thereafter.

And the food was quite good.  We started off with onion rings, which were very lightly battered, tasted a bit like panko.  Very nicely done, especially with the bourbon honey mustard dipping sauce.  My wife had the Kentuckyaki Burger, which she enjoyed.  The meat was high-quality, the grilled pineapple was fresh (not canned), and the burger was cooked to perfection.  Her only complaint was the sauce ... She felt the burger could have more on it, rather than just a very small dollop.  She had the sweet potato croquettes as a side dish, which were tasty, but we both thought they'd be better if they were smaller.  I had the Pepper Pollo burger, which was made out of ground chicken.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was moist and full of flavor.  No complaints, not even room for improvement, because it was really tasty!  I had the french fries with it, which were good.  I confess we didn't have any apple pie dessert, as we were stuffed ... But my toddler enjoyed a cupcake, which was pretty darned good.

Prices weren't too bad for the quality and quantity of food ... My most major complaint was the fact that there's no real Kid's menu. Other than they'll make some mini-burgers and they have ""chicken strips"" which is actually a chicken patty that they slice into strips.  But I will say in their favor that it WAS really good chicken.

Add all this up with a warm and stylish interior and a prime location in Downtown Lakewood, and it's a recipe for success, and a nice addition to Lakewood's array of eateries.",4.0

"I ordered the crispy pata. Pancit, menudo, thai tea and coke drink. Then a separate order of flan (dessert) to go. Majority of the main dishes come with one scoop of rice.  The crispy pata; my mother and I did enjoy as well as the pancit. It was pretty good. But we both agreed that the menudo was weird tasting and didn't like it at all. The rice wasn't soft... It was really hard! Why?? The flan was for my boyfriend (who's cuban) in his opinion... He loves it. 

All in all, the food was good except for the menudo. But beware the service is horrible. There are people waiting a long time at the door to be seated because no one pays any attention to them and I was one of them. I do admit I didn't leave a tip only because I had no cash on me. I normally use my debit card to leave a tip with my whole order but they don't do that? Weird policy! All the waitresses are pretty nice and sweet. I'm just don't like the owner who is so rude to her own employees. The owner by the way... Owns Asian market. If you haven't gone there yet... Check out the business on yelp! Bad reviews.",2.0
"Last year, I rode my vintage bike all summer but didn't learn much about bike maintenance - then my trusty steed's chain broke last fall and I didn't bother fixing it before I put it away for the winter. Now, with daylight extending past work hours and the layers being shed, I was eager to get back on my ride.

I headed to Bike Pirates yesterday, as I wanted to actually learn how to give my bike a little TLC. The volunteers were wonderful - Andy met me at the door and helped me load my bike onto a rack, then directed me as the best way to start fixing up my jalopy. This is a community bike space, so there are tools and parts available for everyone to use. Everything is clearly labeled and any time I had questions, all of the volunteers were eager to help me out.

My bike's issues were a little more extensive than I'd originally thought, and I ended up learning about the mechanisms of my bike and how to adjust the back wheel. Any time that I had any questions, there was someone experienced there to help me out - Lisa and Andy gave me great advice, and made me feel totally capable of handling my repairs myself. Two hours later, with some greasy nails, I pedaled my way home with a great sense of satisfaction and gratitude for the awesome crew.

This place has used and new parts available - I bought a new bike chain for $10 - and the spaces operates on donations, which I was more than happy to give. The vibe was friendly and fun - someone cooked a vegan lunch around 5 and everyone (not just the volunteers) was invited to join.

I'm sorry to hear the original reviewer felt discriminated against when he stopped by to pick up an item on Women and Trans-Only day. I researched their site beforehand and was encouraged by the fact they had a day set aside - I think the intention is to make the space feel safe and welcoming to everyone, and those groups can feel intimidated by traditional bike culture. I know I was certainly more inclined to go because it was a W&T Only day, and I saw a sign out front advertising the designation and asking people to respect it. Bike Pirates is open another 4 days of the week when all are welcome.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I visited Arizona from Texas this weekend. We decided to hit up Zipps Saturday evening thinking it'd be the best place to catch both of our college football games (Texas A&M and ASU) since they have about a bajillion TVs. We sat at the bar for several hours, had several drinks each, buffalo wings, and a large pepperoni pizza. 

Pros: The food was pretty good. The wings were crisp but also extremely saucy. The pizza was fresh and hit the spot. Their margs were also pretty tasty. Most importantly, the TV situation here doesn't even kinda suck. There's a good size television every couple feet, which makes for optimal sports watching. And I'm not going to lie, I was pretty impressed when the 9 TVs merged into 1 giant screen when the ASU game started. I don't care who you are, that's cool! 

Cons: The service was less than acceptable. From our very first greeting, we were just appalled with the attitude of our bartender. She was extremely short with us, and just plain rude. And it didn't stop with her. Every bartender after her also had the same kind of unpleasant disposition. It's like one of them caught a severe and extremely contagious case of Resting B*tch Face and then infected the whole bunch. It got to a point where everyone around us was also talking about how they didn't appreciate the way they were being treated. 

Having lots of TVs is cool. Having decent food is also cool. But being treated with respect as a paying customer is the coolest. And in my opinion, it's the customer service that makes or breaks a place.",2.0
"This was on 5/31/2016
Went to get a car wash here and left really upset and unhappy with the attitude of the person in charge there. He wasn't rude, just extremely useless and didn't seem to care to help me. Apparently there is a brush in front of the vacuum stations that you use yourself to clean bugs off the front of your vehicle when you're purchasing the 2 cheaper car washes because purchasing those doesn't include cleaning of your grill. I learned this after paying and going through the wash.
I went through, washed my nice truck and went to start vacuuming and drying it off. Well I got to the front and noticed it was really still dirty. I went to talk to the guy in charge and that's when I learned what those brushes are there for in front of the vacuums. I told him I did not know this and if I could clean it up and go through the wash again or have some one clean it after and he firmly said, NO. Nothing I can do about it.
I walked back to my truck, brushed off the bugs, got in my truck and left. The guy that does the full service looked at my truck and was the one that had advised me to talk to the guy in charge because the cheaper washes don't include the cleaning of the front grill. Any way he noticed how my truck looked when I left and looked disappointed the guy in charge allowed me to leave with my truck looking like crap out of the car wash, their car wash. I took pictures before I left their facility and after I got home literally right on the other side of the 51, less than 2 minutes away. I had to wash the entire front of my truck when I got home again.
All things considered the guy in charge looked like he was already upset and so that did not help my case by the time I got to him, although that should not have affected my care as a paid customer. Good thing there are 2 others not far from here, maybe they will appreciate customers more.

That was just my last visit. The visit before that one of the guys came up to my vehicle as I was choosing my wash and with out me asking for help he started selecting the wash for me. He had selected the $10 wash which I did not want and so I told him hey, that's not what I want and I just went over his hand and backed up the selection myself and choose the cheaper one. The guy just turned around and walked away, I did not see him there this time but that is extremely rude to walk up to a customer and start making selections while mumbling some thing out. Very rude.

"The human toast waving at me on the corner of Rea Road and Williams Pond Road lured me in during lunch time and boy am I glad he/she did. A friend and I went during our lunch break an we were immediately greeted by a smiling host who allowed us to choose where we wanted to sit. As we sat down within seconds our waiter came and took our drink order and provided us with menus. My friend and I took one look at the specials menu for the day and knew instantly what we wanted. She ordered the chicken salad with strawberries, pears, almonds, brie, and other goodies and I ordered the crab salad rolls. The food was so delicious we hardly spoke. After our meal ended we were paid a visit by the manager who asked how our meal was. Our response, ""fantastic!"".

"Selection was good but customer service was horrible. I stood at the checkout with clothes in hand for ten minutes before anyone came over to check me out. When someone finally did come over, I was very quickly passed off to another associate. This second associate answered three phone calls before beginning to ring me out. Each phone call required her to leave the register area and check something on the sales floor. Meanwhile, I'm still standing at checkout just waiting to pay. It took twenty minutes to pay for my five items and leave. For better customer service, I recommend going to the Santan Village location.",2.0

"After consulting Yelp before visiting, I expected the prices at this Harris Teeter to be much higher than the other locations.  I was quite surprised to find that all the specials and daily low priced items like eggs and peanuts and HT brand cereal are no different than any of the other locations.  HT is not a cheap grocery store, but if you look for sale items you can find plenty of good deals.  I never buy the regularly priced items anyways so I haven't noticed any difference at least.

The location is superb, I can get my groceries via walking or bike, which is something that is certainly rare in Charlotte.  I wish it was open later than 11pm since I don't get out of work until 10pm though.

One problem is that because this store occupies a smaller footprint, there are some items that are conspicuously missing.  I just wish they had the knock-off HT brand of Kashi cereals here!",4.0
"Because the nail shop next door was super busy, my family decided to wait for me in the car. Once I finished, I got in the car and they quickly started telling me that we should go here for lunch, because they are busy. They said there was a lot of foot traffic and people were ordering food for delivery, because they've seen 3 delivery guys come and go over the last half hour. Knowing that I Yelp, they told me to check and see what people are saying about it, so I did and noticed a few recent one star reviews. Now for the record, I take some one star reviews with a grain of salt, especially those where this is their one and only review or you look at their profile and notice that they have written 20 one and two star reviews.

So anyway, we went in thinking it was set up buffet-style and we'd pick our goodies through the glass case and go, but nope! You go in, order, they cook it, and then you have the choice of eating there or taking it to go. They have a menu that is full of all kinds of dishes! 

For appetizers, you can choose from 12 different choices, from Pork Egg Rolls ($1.50 for 1), Cream Cheese with Crab Wontons ($4.95 for 6) and BBQ Boneless Spare Ribs ($6.25), Beef Teriyaki Sticks ($5.95 for 5), or Pan Fried or Steamed Dumplings ($5.95 for 9). They even have the Pu Pu Platter, which is a combination of several appetizers ($9.95 and enough for 2 people).

They have soups like Vegetable with Tofu ($4.75 for a qt.) and Wonton Soup (pt. $2.95/qt. $4.75). Chop Suey, which is like Chow Mein Noodles comes in six different choices, including chicken, vegetable, and shrimp. The Fried Rice, Lo Mein, Chow Fun, Pad Thai, and Egg Foo Young all come in similar choices. There are several chicken dishes, from Kung Pao Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Salt and Pepper Wings to Lemon Chicken and Chicken with Garlic Sauce. There are also several beef and shrimp dishes available. 

Chopsticks also has 12 different Chef's Special dishes, including Orange Beef ($9.75), Pineapple Crispy Shrimp ($11.25), Honey Walnut Shrimp ($11.95), and something called the Dragon and Phoenix (shrimp w/chili sauce on one side and General Tso's chicken on the other $10.75). They also offer several healthy options and can cater to vegetarian diets. They can alter any dish to make it mild or more than the normal spicy. You just tell them what you want.

They serve family dinners that come with soup, several appetizer options and two full entrées (Option A $24.90 and Option B $28.90). They also offer party trays for very reasonable prices and have a menu of 20 different Combination Plates, which come with chicken fried rice and a spring roll. The choices include everything from Orange Chicken ($7.25), Pepper Steak w/onion ($7.55), and Sweet & Sour Pork (7.25) to Shrimp w/lobster sauce (7.95), General Tso's Chicken (7.25), and Shrimp Lo Mein ($7.95). I was also glad to see that they have a good sized menu of Lunch Specials that run daily, not just Monday through Friday! These specials are available from opening until 4pm Monday through Sunday. There are 21 choices ranging from $6.25 to $7.95.

We ordered three combination plates; the Sweet and Sour Pork, Broccoli and Beef, and Kung Pao Chicken. The servings were large and more than enough! We each tried the others dish and all of them were delicious. I like that the Sweet and Sour Pork had the sauce on the side. I don't know if they put it on there for those who sit and eat, but I appreciate it being on the side for to-go orders, so that it's not soggy by the time you eat it. The Broccoli and Beef were so flavorful and tender and I loved that there was enough sauce in there. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken with no peanuts. I am not a fan of nuts in food (hee...hee...no pun intended). Anyway, it was very good, but I should have had them make it spicier. At the time, I didn't know that you could. I wish that their containers (reusuable plastic ones, by the way...thumbs up!!) Had a separation, because my rice soaked up most of the sauce. It wasn't all that bad, because it was really flavorful with the rice, but I would have liked to have more of that sauce for my chicken and veggies. 

Chopsticks is located in the busy Walmart center, closer to Red Lobster and the corner of Marks and Sunset Road. They take all credit cards, including American Express and they have great hours; Monday through Friday 10:30am to 10:00pm and Saturday and Sundays 11:00am to 10:00pm. They also deliver to your home or hotel, within a reasonable distance!",4.0

From walking into the door and being great by 'breana' in the most unprofessional way. Usually hosts are supposed to be smiley and upbeat to start your dinner off right, I guess she must of missed that part of orientation. The server we had, greeted us nicely but when we said we only wanted a salad, he quickly changed his demeanor.

They also give two types of salsa, a red and green one, in which the red salsa is my absolute favorite! I usually also for the the al pastor tacos that comes with 3 filling tacos, beans, and rice. I think the tacos are a great combination of marinated al pastor and sweetness from the pineapples and ingredients. I recently had their carne asada quesadilla and it was perfect! The right amount of cheese and flavor from the meat! It also domes with a little guacamole, lettuce, and tomatoes and tastes great all together. My friends have gotten the veggies tacos, veggies enchilada, and filet mignon tacos and they were really good too! The staff is always so friendly and attentive too which I always appreciate.

I was looking at reviews  on my phone for different resuraunt in the area and this one sounded pretty good with its wood fired advertisement. My parents are simple eaters and when we walked in we were surprised to find that it was more gourmet food than we expected. We looked over the menu and figured we would just share a pizza and order salads. Our waiter came over and was very nice! He explained the menu and offered alterations to our meal (Margaretta pizza add pepperoni) and catered to our individual requests. He explained the beer menu very well to my mom and offered her samples because she was unsure. To top off our superior service, the food was incredible! They make their own mozzarella in house, you could taste just how incredibly fresh all the ingredients were, our salads (house and BLT) pizza (see above) and dessert (peaches and cream trifecta and cheese cake trio) were to die for!!!

My bacon serving was 2 slices and it was smokey, sweet, meaty, salty, crispy and delish! The potatoes were quite uneven in size and therefore very uneven in how they were cooked.

The interior of the restaurant is nice and simple, you can choose to eat-in or take-out. Now the food: it is really good, and full of flavour. I ordered chicken curry spring rolls as appetizer, the hakka masala chicken and the szcheuan beef and i really enjoyed the meals. For the kids I ordered a meal with leag and back chicken on top of fried rice which is not spicy and they loved it. Let me tell you that the portions are huge so expect to take some left overs home, as far as what you get for the price it doesn't get any better.

So I asked her why she has such a bad attitude and she said I didn't have an attitude I couldn't hear you our headsets are bad. Not sorry our headsets are not working right like any professional would've said. At this point I'm pissed took her store number and name, left a message for corporate or distract manager, also sent an email regarding the incident. I will not be returning to this location EVER!

This is the place I went after getting thrown out of the Little Woody (across the street), only it went by another name at that time. 

I had several craft brews, got a spectacular view of Camelback Mountain at sunset, and got to eat someone's leftover half-burger. 
No I'm not homeless. What the fuck?

It's just that this old dude ordered a burger split. When it arrived, the chick he was scamming on was all...

    ""Who's that for? I don't eat read meat! Do I look like I eat red meat?""

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down and shut the fuck up I'm thinking to myself as this haughty little ingenue delivered a scene reminiscent of Scarlet 'fucking' O'hara in Gone With The WInd, her every word punctuated and overacted.

After her performance, she hastily stormed out. That's when I nudged the guy and asked if he was gonna eat that.

Hourly can be pricey, but it is free if you are quick. Picking someone up, it is obviously the way to go.

The Daily lot is where CLT shows its worth. Daily East has a big ole parking deck with 5 floors or some nonsense. That's great but you need to take a bus from there to the terminal, so you might as well be parking in the long term lots. But Daily West abuts the Hourly lot. Some of the spaces are closer to the terminal than the expensive hourly spaces. This is the prime location, less than a 90 second walk from the terminal. You are closer to your flight than to the shuttle bus! This is the airport's best kept secret. I shouldn't even be telling you. Save me a spot and we won't have any problems.",4.0
"They seriously have the best buffalo chicken sandwich I have ever tasted! Fresh veggies, delicious sauces and thick hunks of meat all on a butter-toasted bun for a reasonable $5.60 plus tax. 

I would have given this five stars, but the service was pretty poor. All the same, I still recommend this place over the McDonalds next door.",4.0
The staff is mostly college students that are extremely savvy with the computer checkout and return registers.  I had two returns and had to wait about 5 minutes before they could find someone that knew how to do a return.  The good thing was they were have a 25% off sale and I was just exchanged two shirts for different sizes so I got extra cash back!  The book store is owned by efollet which is okay I guess.  The clothes are reasonably priced and the books are expensive like any college bookstore.They do have a good selection of apparel and hats. It is a good place to start if you are looking for official ASU gear.,2.0
"今天我去爱丽丝买面包，因为我身上带的现金有限。所以想刷卡，但是她们说只收现金，在我后面的那位阿姨就开口说你们不是可以刷卡吗！！爱丽丝的收银员就给她一个眼神，好像在说""你可以刷卡的意思""。最后那位收银员真的给那位阿姨刷卡了。我觉得一家店有两种方式对待客人，真的是心寒。我老婆是你们面包店的老客人了，她有告诉我你们面包店有买满多少就可以刷卡。但是那位收银员根本就没有告诉我，也没有想让我刷卡的意思，而给了那位买了很多而且也是你们的老客人阿姨刷卡了！！！一家连什么是customer service都不知道的人也能出来做生意。真的感到悲哀！！",1.0

"How amazing is this place. New to the area and came in for happy hour with my daughter. The waitress was very welcoming and warm.

"Had read the reviews on Yelp about Pearl King before purchasing a Groupon, so knew to expect higher prices than a Chinatown experience.  But the prices can be justified by:  ability to make a reservation (a criteria for the Groupon, but also great to be able to reserve a table);  and a nice spacious and CLEAN seating area.

We were really pleased by the dishes we ordered for lunch:  Har gow;  Siu Mai;  BBQ pork buns, Hockey Pucks, chicken dumpling, a scallop skewer and the shrimp-stuffed portabello mushroom.  A few of the servings were on the small side - the scallop skewer was literally ONE scallop divided into 3 thin slices, but it was tasty.  We loved the stuffed portabello the most as it is different from what you can order from other places.  

Based on Yelp reviews, we also knew to expect a potential tea service charge, and were ready to dispute it if it appeared on our bill.  I had water, and my friend had iced tea.  The glass of Iced tea was $4!  But no other service charge.

My Groupon was $15, which gave a $30 credit on my bill.  The bill incl tax and credit came to around $20, + tip = $26.  For $41 total outlay ($15+$26), it was a decent but kind of expensive lunch (but in a nice setting).  If the bill had been without the Groupon, I don't think it would have been worth it at all!

After our lunch, my friend and I went shopping downtown.  About 90-120 minutes after lunch, we were extremely parched, and our feet felt swollen (despite unhurried walking).  Our conclusion was that the dim sum was likely laden with MSG.  Typically neither of us have extreme reactions to MSG (and realize it's often in Chinese food), but since we shared a lunch, we figured it was the culprit.  Too bad it was a bad ending to what was otherwise an OK dim sum lunch.",3.0
We got a coupon in the mail via Valpak and decided to give the place a try and are we glad that we did!  I had the shrimp po-boy and my husband got the oyster.   Nice big pieces cooked just right with not too much batter and not masked by a big hunk of bread.  Red beans and rice were very good too and fantastic Key lime pie.  Kenny and Larry (the owner) are really trying to build up the business as they are in a location not real visible from the street they are very friendly and helpful.  We will definitely go back!,5.0
"Been coming here since they opened. Use to really like the food and service. Well came in tonight they have cut the menu down to one page, and raised the price. They took all the great things away.

"Downtown Chandler has needed a sports bar with a bunch of tv's like this. It's a good spot to watch some games and the UFC fights. The lounge area is pretty nice but always reserved so walk-in parties we've had have had to go elsewhere a couple times already.

Lunch is my most common time to visit here... having a party of over 5 sometimes becomes a time issue; lately it's been better but we stopped going for a while because of the length of time to eat lunch pay and get out.  Their food is really good but the consensus is that it's all a little overpriced. Burger Monday's you get a $7 (if you don't modify it) burger w/ fries but most lunches will run you about $12-$15 + tip.

We've had a couple of events in their side room and those have gone well. 
The management, when around, are very nice and seem to keep things moving more quickly than when they're not present. 

Some local beers and fairly decent happy hours make it the only but the best sports bar in downtown Chandler. Not awesome but it works.",3.0
"I'm have been vegan for many years & am very cautious about GMO's & avoid them at all cost. With that being said, I absolutely love that most everything at Pomegranate Cafe is vegan & organic & bonus stars for the raw options. I went there the first time towards the end of October & I had some kind of a burrito. I ate the whole thing, it was delicious. I then ordered a caramel coconut drink from their coffee menu along with a desert. Everything was delicious. After I was finished m I went to the bathroom to wash my hands & I am not sure what happened but shortly after I came out, I got nauseated. I puked all my lunch which is way odd for me to so b/c I NEVER vomit/puke or anything. Not even when I  sick. Maybe I was so excited I ate too quick & too much? I don't know. Another weird thing that happened was, during our lunch, I asked to keep one of the menus b/c I wanted to continue browsing through (it was my first time there) I was told I couldn't b/c they were short of menus. LOL. Odd. Then a few minutes later she gave me back the menu. Alrighty. Ha!!

My B/F said that we should not come back b/c he was sure it was the food that made me sick but I refused to believe. We went back again a couple of weeks later & I had he raw tacos. They were good. We had a good experience. Except when I ordered my caramel coconut drink from the coffee menu, it didn't taste the same as last time. Like AT ALL. I ended up throwing it away. But, overall, a nice experience.

My 3rd visit just a couple of weeks ago, I ordered the French toast and was very disappointing. There was nothing French toast about this French toast. It was a pastry, like banana bread. Totally didn't even eat it. Had a few bites but that's it. I did order the organic scramble & it was super delicious.

4 stars for now.",4.0
"Actually this one star is given because of the staff who was on duty whom I found very courteous and seemed helpless.

"Came here for breakfast so shopping would be bearable - I hate lines. Anyways, this place is a local greasy spoon, and its okay.

Don't look for décor, ambience or anything fancy, this really is a hole in the wall, but at least you can resurrect yourself without having to suffer noisy kids or preppy customers.

I love the sweet potato fries as a side. Fish tacos are also a good idea. 

The beer is great. They have seasonal beers on tap which are always fun. The regular beers are good. IPA and double IPA go down nice.",5.0

"When signs say things like ""All you can eat sushi for 10.99,"" it's really hard for me to say no.  So I didn't.

I should probably say that I've only been here for lunch; not sure if the menu is different, or if the price is different, for dinner.  Here's what I think about lunch.  Aji Sai offers up a big menu and most of it is available under the $11 umbrella.  This includes many kinds of maki and hand rolls, as well as things like gyoza, some barbecued meats, spring rolls, etc.  It doesn't include sashimi, but for $11, what else can you expect?

I enjoyed the food, and I'd probably give it a 7/10 on quality.  Not the best, but still excellent.  Service is a bit hit and miss there.  The thing seems to be the size of your group.  If you decide to go with your whole office (it happens...) be smart and divide yourself into groups of 4-6 people.  Anything bigger, and it just becomes too unwieldy.  The staff will (obviously) bring you your food but things get confusing easily, and it just turns into bad news for no one.",4.0
Pusateri's is one of those places that can suprise you.  Yes it can be expensive but it's almost always an excellent product and service.  The deli foods are often devine.  And the organic vegetables are actually a bargain.  Yes there are a lot of entitled customers there but frankly I fine them entertaining.  I do miss the valet parking on Bay street I have to admit.  They do have valet parking next door. I'm a fan.,4.0

"I'm visiting family in the Phoenix area for a couple of weeks. I was getting hungry for Thai food, but don't know the area well enough to know where all the good Thai restaurants are. I asked a family friend and she suggested this place, as she's a regular.

Touch of Thai is a little restaurant located in a strip mall in Peoria, AZ. Don't let the unimpressive setting deter you from a visit!

Five of us came in for a late lunch today and were treated very well. The waitstaff was friendly and the service top-notch. However, the food is the true stand-out here, and it's very reasonably priced. The red curry ranks up with the best I've had in my home state of Minnesota, and we have a LOT of Thai restaurants. 

If you've saved room for dessert, order a ""snowball,"" which consists of black sticky rice and coconut ice cream, and be prepared for a real taste treat... their ice cream is made on premises. I'm glad we split it because I might've ended up eating the whole thing myself.

I may try some other Thai places while I'm here, but I could end up comparing them to this one. Touch of Thai was a great intro to Thai food in the Phoenix area.",5.0

"My girlfriend and I were walking down Queen West last Saturday and stumbled upon this place. Initially we walked in with an intention to rest for few minutes while having a drink and perhaps a little snack. We were seated at a back yard patio that was secluded, cozy and shaded by greenery, which immediately put us into relaxed yet uplifted mood. We ordered a kir breton and prosciutto garlic-potato crepes. 

We thought we were not really hungry, but after sharing this delicately crafted, adventurously delicious crepe we couldn't help but want more and ordered a sweet kind - pear strawberry with hot chocolate sauce. That was a real treat - crepe was so light it melted in your mouth, fruit was ripe and tasty, and chocolate was moderately dark and genuine. It was so good that after finishing the serving and overcoming a moment of guilt-laden hesitation we ordered a repeat performance, which went without a hitch. 

On top of wonderful food add great friendly service, cozy space and moderate prices and you have yourself a perfect haven for brunch, dinner or chill-out snack.",4.0

Then we order a carnitas nachos and it was meh. I wasn't impressed with the flavor at all. The nachos was bland and kinda boring, but it came with a great amount of guac. Then the owner recommended us the Me Gusta Bowl which completely surprised me. The quinoa was perfectly cooked, the mango dressing was tart and complimented the quinoa. We got it with kalbi meat and it was a great choice. I definitely recommend this Ko-Mex fusion but only on certain options!",4.0

I had been to Oddfellows once before and remembered it being good, but this time the food was even better. Delicious appetizer of pork belly (big enough to share - lots of food!), and I followed with the brisket burger which was OMFG good. Really tender and generous, I couldn't finish, and not for lack of trying,

"I've enjoyed eating here a handful of times and the food has always been good and service has been average. Today though everything was horrible. It wasn't necessarily the servers fault as it appeared she was spread a little thin, but when that busy standing around chit chatting with others didn't help. 
It took sitting there 10 minutes at least before we could place a drink order and by then we had our orders ready to go as well. My husband's salad came quick enough and then 15 mins after ordering my toddler's pizza came. We were informed the plate was hot, so obviously I took to avoid my 2 yr old getting burned. Why put a child's pizza on a hot plate and then continue to bring it out still has me a little baffled, but I guess that's acceptable to them. It's about 20 minutes after placing our orders and we still don't have our drinks (we didn't order anything fancy, just a beer and ice tea) and eventually  I am able to get the servers attention to ask where they are. We actually ended up getting our food before the drinks. As for the food my husband's food had to me immediately returned as his pulled pork sandwich was so cold I thought for a second it must have been pulled from the refrigerator. My chicken Caesar salad was ok, but definitely nothing impressive. I could have saved myself 5 dollars and gotten one down the street at Rachel's. Waiting to pay ended up being a joke as well. My husband and son actually ended up getting up and going outside as I sat there for a good 15 minutes. I must have looked annoyed because the other server in the area actually giggled when she saw my face. It took the manager walking past me almost twice before he offered to take the check and ring it up. From now on my family will be venturing farther from home to find another BJ's location.",2.0

I love the life sized brass work of animals and people found right outside the door.

Not quite as exposed as you thought huh?  

Great art for those at the high end, but the owner also makes a conscious choice to ensure there is art for everyone offering matted reproductions and even greeting cards of some popular pieces.

"Sad to be reviewing Becketts so low, but was highly disappointed with the experience. We had been recommended this place from someone in the industry, but will never return. 

To start, I had a reservation at 715, called and informed them I was running 5 min late (being courteous) yet when I got there I was not sat until about 750, and I arrived at 721. No empathy from the host, so we decided to get a drink at the bar, and the lady at the bar was not friendly at all, and when my friend ordered a coffee she got the ""death stare of ""really"", but my boyfriend and I ordered cocktails. Hoping once we sat the service from the server would make up for it.....nope. He was as cold as could be, did not seem happy to share about the menu at all. On top of all that he was just so slow and sluggish to do anything. He never checked to see how the food was ... so much for ""2 min, 2 bite check"". If he would have checked I would have ordered a nice glass of wine (lost profit there). Oh and no manager presence. 

The mains were just sub par. We had the scallops, pork chop and short rib; none which stood out. The only reason there is a 2nd star is because the cheddar jalapeño biscuits and the mac and cheese were fantastic. 

Overall a very disappointing experience, and don't plan to return nor will be recommending. Guess that's why it wasn't super busy on a Saturday night.",2.0

"Simply Magical. This venue had everything we wished for in a wedding venue. Tony Palacios & staff took great care of us & accommodated every need & resolve every concern. We were able to rest easy & absolutely enjoy the wedding. The facility is absolutely stunning resembling a historical rustic of the southwest with contemporary elements such as high ceilings, floors with a marble like feel, chandeliers & lots of open space giving it a very modern and elegant feel. It has a penthouse like bridal suite upstairs with a kitchen, with granite counters, dressing area, small living room, shower & an opening that allows you to oversee the entire wedding from above. It's an amazing view & prefect for wedding photos. The downstairs room can be used for the groom & groomsmen but we decided to get ready at the hotel instead. The venue can be used as all inclusive or bring in vendors of your choice. We used their in-house decor (which does not need much because of that natural beauty it already has) flower vendor (which did an amazing job & had everything ready just as we game planned), catering (which was mouth watering delicious) & cake vendor (possibly the best cake we've ever eaten). The prices are very reasonable here and we have people still raving about the food, cake & how beautiful the wedding was. It was so perfect that it makes you want to get married all over again.  The location was perfect nestled in historic downtown Mesa, AZ and right across from our ceremony site, the Mesa Fine Arts Center rooftop, perfect for a modern & elegant wedding with terrific background views. All in all, we had the time of our lives. We deeply appreciate everything & everyone who contributed to our wedding from Lena (the owner) Tony Palacios (wedding event coordinator), the bartender they provide and the rest of the staff. We wish you guys the best on continuing to make future brides & groom's dream wedding a reality. 

Kindest regards from the newly weds,

Wilbo & Amy",5.0
"Again guys I dodge a line here! So be prepared to wait if you go after 8. Anyways it was 7am and there I was drinking a mimosa, the airport has weird rules and no judge zone am I right?

Their mimosa was pretty standard but it was actually fresh squeezed oranges which is a plus. But you know it's a mimosa so eh. 

I had French toast and smoke sausage which the toast was amazing. The sausage however was so salty it wasn't even edible. So I left it. 

The biggest flaw was that buzz me if you need a waitress button. It made the whole thing uncomfortable. At one point I wanted another mimosa but it didn't feel right to hit the button to buzz her over. That's just weird. I get their trying to under staff and save on waitresses but it's a weird encounter. The waitress was nice though with good recommendations but still. 

If their is no line go if there is an obnoxious line skip it.",3.0
"My husband and I are and have been in the Las Vegas service industry for over 20 yrs.  We try hard to give a good experience every time with a welcoming smile. .  Funny enough, my husband hates seafood but, loves me!  We repeatedly come to the Red Lobster on Flamingo.  Food is fantastic!  Even better, it is so nice to be catered to, the way we cater to others.  Jesus is our favorite server, I'm sure they're all great, we always wait for him.  FIVE STAR SERVICE!",5.0

They nickel and dime you for everything...$1.79 for a breadstick! They use to be $1.00...CRAZY! I got a half portion and it's definitely not half the portion of noodles in there...very disappointed.

"I am new to Vietnamese food. I liked my rice with marinated pork, and my companions liked their pho and bahn mi. Restaurant was clean, but the building it was in and the restrooms down the hall were not. We had a new waitress whose inexperience, mixed with our inexperience, made for a hard time ordering. Overall, my experience was average, but would give it another try because the food was the strongest part of the experience and the rest could have just been a bad day.",3.0

"One of the best places to stop for coffee downtown. I used to work in the area for man years and I stopped in here every day for a cup of coffee.

It is located in the lobby of the Regional Enterprise Tower (formerly known as the Alcoa Building) and is almost easy to pass by if you're in a hurry. It is a great spot to grab a cup of coffee to go if you're in a hurry (if that's your thing), but I'd much rather grab a mug and sit in the lobby for awhile.

They offer coffee of all kinds, smoothies, juices, pasties, and often times pre-made sandwiches or fruit cups.

The staff is friendly and the owner, Ward, is one of the most enthusiastic coffee guys you'll meet in Pittsburgh. He is very passionate about his place and the things on the menu.

Although it is known as a cafe interested in local, organic, and fresh ingredients, it definitely doesn't have the pretentious vibe you may relate to that.

I recommend Simpatico to anybody in the downtown area, whether you're just looking for a quick coffee or smoothie to go, or looking to hang around and have some great coffee conversation!",5.0
"FYI non pork eaters.....For brunch you cannot substitute out pork for anything (not even a slice of tomato), but you can add a slice of avocado for $4. No price reduction offered for the removal of pork. Reason given ""plates are carefully constructed to a price point"". But with that logic if you remove the bacon, a price reduction should be offered? Our table just tipped less, so it all worked out, but still strange.  

All sides offered on the menu are pork based.",2.0

"I've just recently moved to the Enterprise area and checked out a few local bars & pubs. I'd say Sporting Life is the nicest and most fan-friendly, given their numerous HD LED TVs and ample seating. The food was good and the drinks reasonably priced. If there's one thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, it would be the smokiness. I realize smoking is still prevalent in LV but having it spill over from the neighboring booth while eating isn't very enjoyable. Nevertheless, I highly recommend SL as your go-to neighborhood sports bar and if you're into trivia, make sure to look them up on Tuesday's!",4.0
"This place was amazing!  The food and the ambiance could not have been better.  The service was exceptional.  We started with a sampling of appetizers that our waiter recommended.  They were so good that i could have had that as my entree and been happy!  The main dish was just as delightful.  I had the Dover Sole.  They actually fillet the fish table side and the presentation was excellent, but the taste was out of this world.  Great flavor and detail.  I really can't think of anything they could have done better.  This was an exceptional meal.",5.0
"Went to Nello's yesterday with a friend that had never been there before.  We ordered everything to share. We had pizza, the Appertivo and a salad.  There was more than enough for us and probably two more people.  Everything and I mean everything was fresh, and delicious.  The Appertivo was over the top in goodness, the salad  was piled high with all the goodies promised.  The pizza crust was so crisp and all the add ons were hidden under layers of yummy cheese.  No complaints, will eat there again very soon!",4.0
They are remodeling right now which I wasn't aware of the extent of the remodel when I booked. 830 am Saturday we woke up to the building being sand blasted so loud you couldn't sleep in or be at the pool. Pool was small and packed with people. Looked bigger in the picture. Room was on the second floor. Elevator was out. Each time the door opened to the hall the window would shake and rattle. Pool noise was loud for afternoon naps in the room making it impossible along with the rattle of the window each time the hall was entered. Bed was small and uncomfortable. Wish we were told about the extent of the remodel. The weekend was a birthday gift to my husband who didn't want to stay after the first night.,2.0

"The service was excellent, but I found the food to be very mediocre at best...Had Meat Sauce on one entree and marinara on the other, both very bland, flavorless.  The bread they serve obviously comes frozen and is served cold, just not good.  Salad is ok, and the dessert (4 Layer chocolate cake) is another Frozen jobber, dry and unexciting.  I find the bread and meat sauce at The old Spaghetti factory to be much more to my liking.  Would be willing to try other entrees at Rigatony's.  Guess my friend and I made a mistake by opting for the $8.95 early bird special, go figure!",2.0
"I only have one regret.That we didn't find Claude and Amy sooner! The magnet school she attends (LVA) requires their students to have private instructions.

Hopefully they were all removed before somebody gets sick. Make sure you always check the dates!!! Another thing, we bought pears there and the night we brought them home they were already completely ROTTEN! With holes and what looked like mold as well. After only a few hours... Not good produce. Plus, always compare prices. There's stuff in here for $5 you can get at Smiths for $1.99.",1.0
"It's interesting to see other reviews that were very positive including it being ""the best korean grill in town"" cause I thought it was absolutely the worst.

To it's credit, I like the physical grills there.  They were hot, and cooked fast.

Not in it's favour:
- Innattentive staff
- Slow service
- Portions of meat brought to the table were very small.  Yes it's all you can eat.  But when the service is shitty, it's more frustrating that you have to keep getting their attention to get more food.
- I had to repeat requests.

If find the service lacking at most Korean BBQ restuarants, and I think many others do to.  But it's usually not so bad that it doesn't outweigh the quality of the food and the good price.
The fact that I was so incensed by the service shows how bad it was.  My dinner companion agreed as well.

I was actually livid by the time my meal was over and glad to leave.  I'll go back to my regular Korean BBQ thanks.

I gave this 1 star only because the food was still ok.",1.0
"If you're looking for a place to learn how to dance, I sure hope you live near the chandler location of Fred Astaire Dance Studio. 

I started back in October to get ready for a friend's wedding and quickly became addicted to how great this place makes me feel. Don't wait! Don't fear! The instructors here will make learning ballroom dance so much fun you'll wish you could quit work, put up a cot in the corner and live there (not allowed, by the way -- I've looked into it). You'll make amazing friends (because everybody that walks through those doors is bound to be as fun loving and up for new adventures as you are, right?!) and you'll receive the best instruction available anywhere. This franchise has been around long enough to have already worked out the smoothest ways to move you from step right-together-left to gold level competition ballroom. Or as far as you want to go. As soon as you start, you'll proabably realize, as I did, that that's farther than you thought possible! And, guys, please go here and get a clue -- men who know how to lead are hot hot hot.

No buts at all. This place and the people in it deserve all five stars. 

P.S. the Mesa Fred Astaire location is owned by the same lovely lady. She has a knack for picking excellent instructors, so if you aren't close enough to Chandler, give Mesa a try.",5.0
"Bait & Switch!  Such a terrible experience. Tuesday, we spoke with Mike Nations on the phone about a 2010 Kia Optima with 31K miles advertised for $12K.  He said the car was under a Borrowed Car Agreement but would surely be available Wednesday night, then he pitched an invite to Thursday's Tent Event sale - Where all of their inventory would be, including the Optima.  When we called about the car on Wednesday, he didn't answer.  Thursday morning, we received two phone calls from two different sales-sharks, each calling to make sure we were coming to the Tent Event.  They both confirmed that the Optima was back in stock, no longer under the BCA.  Taking off work early to snag such a good deal, we arrived at the tent event at 3:30 and filled out paperwork to have our credit run.  After submitting that, Mike took us out to see the inventory and mentioned there were many cars on the lot for under $15,000.  I stopped him and asked where the Kia was, explaining that that was the car we came for and that we weren't interested in any others.  Mike said it was at the dealership lot and said he would go ask someone to bring it to the tent event.  When he returned, he reverted to the story that the car was BCA! We went to the financing counter and the guy there told us that the car was in the row of cars just West of the dealership and asked Mike to take us and show us the car.  Once at the dealership, I checked the VIN against the Carfax I had printed earlier.  It was a different car.  Sales manager, Vince, came out and said he had actually just sold that vehicle, but could look for another at auction on-line.  When he did, he suggested a 52K 2010 Optima for $13k.  What a waste of time!  Avoid this place.",1.0
"This is a review for their banquet menu, as I was here with a group.  The first course is a trio of pastas, each with their own sauce.  A few tortellini's, a ravioli, and I don't remember what the third was.  It was a little overcooked, but the best thing I had.  

Next was the salad.  Wow, what tough lettuce leafs!  Other than that is was ok, just a basic dinner salad, nothing to set it apart.  

For the main course, we had a choice between filet mignon, sea bass, or chicken.  They ran out of my first choice, the fish so I went with the chicken.  The description sounded good, but it wasn't.  I didn't realize it was going to be breaded, and the breading was mushy.  Underneath, the chicken was dry and overdone.  

Who picks these places?!?!? Seriously, I need to figure out who plans these company functions and introduce them to the wonderful world of Yelp.  I think it would have significant positive impact for the company as a whole.  Employee morale would go up, individual performance would soar, productivity would increase, we would gain market share, and before you know it, we would be topping Forbes top companies to work for lists.",2.0
"What a pretentious, hipster hellhole. 

I was out for dinner with two friends last night, looking to try a few different places we'd heard about along College. We didn't have a reservation at Woodlot, but dropped by and saw there was no one waiting in the lineup, so asked to put our names on the list. The hostess told us it would be approximately 45 minutes for a table to come free, but that it might be available earlier and we could leave our phone number and she'd call us when they had a spot. It was early (7:45) so we went for it, left our number and headed around the corner for a drink.

An hour later, we still hadn't heard from them, so I called to ask what was happening with the table. The hostess told me the people at our table were still waiting for their desserts and that it would be another 20 minutes. I started to get frustrated as, to me, there is a big difference in being asked to wait 45 minutes for a table and being told it would be 1 hour 30 min. She told me the 45 minute wait time was ""just a quote"" and that she couldn't know when the table would be free. I could be wrong, but isn't it the hostess' job to accurately predict when tables will turn over and to manage customers accordingly? 

We paid the bill for our cocktails and walked back to Woodlot and just as we arrived, our table (which was in fact the communal, baker's table, which we were never told about) became free.

We were seated at the communal table and promptly given menus and then a server frantically pushed our plates and cutlery into place. She even slid our water glasses across the table to each of us, like she was on the Olympic curling team.

We did not see our server or ask to have our drink orders taken for the first 10 minutes we were seated. I looked at my dinner companions and we decided that, even if it was a spectacular meal, we would probably not be able to judge it fairly after the super rocky start we'd had to our dinner. So, before we placed any orders, we decided to leave and head to the Pomegranate Restaurant down the street, which is a new favourite for me.

I'm sure the Woodlot's food is worth a wait, or a reservation made well in advance, but the impression they left on me with the poor customer service means I won't go back to try it.",1.0

Great exercise and a environment.

"Actually ordered food from here this time. I got the fried sushi roll with lobster (I can't remember the name), and it was pretty good considering this eatery doesn't exactly specialize in sushi. Also, if ordering a drink, or at least a milk tea, I personally recommend getting it blended, as opposed to iced, as last time my iced milk tea came out far too potent, but my blended milk tea today was far more suitable for my palate. The boba, however, was far too firm for my liking. Warning: it can be a little pricey though, as a small--although the cup itself isn't too diminutive in size--milk tea is $4.",3.0
"Copacabana is the best AYCE steakhouse in Toronto. Take that with a grain of salt as there's only 3 in Toronto.

The downtown location is newer, larger and better looking than the Eglinton and Yonge location. Of course thats what they tell you when they charge you $10 more than the midtown location. (Tip: If you're going with family or prefer more lowkey, go to the Eglinton and Yonge one. Downtown's vibe is much more extravagant)

""Copa"" is the ultimate feast in a boy's night out. It's got all the steak you can eat, half naked girls dancing (Weekends only) and a good selection in drinks. I won't list all the selection of meats available, it's on their website, but know that their Top Sirloin is amazing. When they come by and offer you cornbread, you're going to want to scoff at them offering you bread, but trust me and take one. Take a bite of that delicious cornbread and you'll understand why they dare offer it. It tastes amazing. 

Some common complaints is that the meat is salty and the service really can be slow. I agree with both. I remember that we once went past the two hour limit, but after speaking with the manager, our table quickly got the steaks that we requested, and stayed for an extra half hour until we were ready to leave. The steaks really are salty after a while. Very salty. So make sure to get some amazing grilled pineapple to cleanse your taste buds.

Again, this place is a definitely must try. At least once. Come on your birthday and it's free for the birthday boy/gal. (minimum party of 4)",4.0
"I have to disagree with some of the posts. I have been taking my daughter here since she was 4 months old (full head of hair) they've always been nice. It is a bit stressful there but maybe it is because YOU (it only takes one late appointment to throw everything off) are late to YOUR child's appointment. Quit with the excuses of your children make you late, learn how to manage your time efficiently and be more courteous to business owners and those in the service industry (step away from Pintrest for a few minutes, you will have ALL the time in the world).  Imagine how you would feel if you had to deal with screaming kids all day for probably low paying haircuts. I will agree that some things could be seen as rude but it is NOTHING more than I've seen at other salons.  Again they have to deal with screaming, squirmy kids and overbearing mothers -- cut them some slack!

Not even a minute we came in to give the guy my name he didnt get my name right, we were called to our seats while there were several people waiting to be seated before us. 

Our server introduced herself to us and she just didn't seem like she wanted to be here but she did deliver.

I went to the restroom to wash my hands and this is the first time I've ever seen a worker in uniform using her phone with her planner out in the restroom.

The managers stuck out like a sore thumb in the crowd.

Anyways I ordered the $10.29 breakfast sampler came with 2 eggs, 2 sausage links,  and the bf ordered the special ultimate combo breakfast for $7.99 which was a tiny bit different but practically the same.

Server was nice and checked up on us to see how were doing which was nice after she saw that I was disappointed.  I explained to her that my order is practically the same as his but more expensive which I didn't understand.  She said the orders are not the same and that it is better to order from the specials which was the best advise she can give me.  

My best advise for the servers here are to suggest a special for a customer as an alternative for a better deal to get a better tip.

"While in Canada for a few days with my girls, we decided to grab a bite to eat on the first full morning after arrival.  I can not remember the name of the place we initially went to, but they were closing soon and not very inviting since it was near time for them to close.  Understanding, we decided to ask someone walking where we could go and she quickly said ""Fran's"" and pointed us in the right direction.

This was the best breakfast meal we had while there!  OMG, the prices were unbelievable for the amount and quality of food.  I was impressed with the OJ prices being that they were mostly fresh squeezed.  I say mostly fresh squeezed because when I saw the prep, they did in fact pour a little orange 'juice' from a gallon container.  I asked the waitress what that was and she described in detail their process.  She said basically depending on the oranges they receive, some may not be sweet enough, so they add a little 'help'.  Seriously, it wasn't that much added, and it was so good.  I mean let's be honest, there are a lot of restaurants that serve a fancy glass of Minute Maid OJ.  So at least 90% of Fran's OJ was actually OJ.  :-)

Most of us ordered the Big Breakfast, which was really big and filling for only $12.99.  What a steal.  I went back three days in a row and ordered the exact same thing.  When I tell you once I find something great, I am hooked...believe me.  I shall not lie to you.  I was HOOKED.  

I, the coffee drinker of the group, had coffee and I wanted more.  It was so good with their table cream.  

Lastly, I would like to mention their syrup.  So, you're in Canada and you want real maple syrup right?  Well you wont get it here...BUT it's still better than the norm in the US.  They will actually sell you a bottle of their syrup for you to take with you and we all purchased at least one.  It was great and I have been using it since.  Now once it's gone...I don't know what I will do.  I guess I will need to make another trip and rack up!

The service was great all three days and I had to leave a bigger tip because there is no way I would have received all that food for that price in the US.  I felt like I was cheating them.  hahaha

Overall, great food and since I was with my girls, it was a nice place to just chat and eat.  Fran's reminded me of an old diner where you could go, grab a cup of Joe and they would actually remember your name and order.",5.0

"I've been a loyal Sephora shopper for years, and I still am. Usually I only buy online, but sometimes I actually like to go into a store when I'm looking for something untested. Unfortunately this is the only Sephora close by in central Pittsburgh.

Unfortunately? Yes, you heard me right. Located on the narrow and notoriously pretentious Walnut Street this is Sephora is tiny and... pretentious. Maybe it comes with the location and the dress code, but every time I go to the Walnut St. Sephora I can't help but think that all their employees are judging me based on my clothes/age and are slyly watching to see if I'm going to steal something. They've been pretty inconsistent with their helpfulness, also.

I'm not being super sensitive, but just as a warning if you're in your early 20's, not wearing a lot of make-up, and not dressed so nicely that day be prepared for some cold customer service from these ladies. Maybe they assume you don't have money? Maybe it's just me, but every time I go I forget to leave my motorcycle jacket at home.

"My ears always perk up at the sound of ""Michelin""...our meal at Wing Lei was definitely not the best of my life, but it was very exceptional.  Especially for Chinese food.  The food/cocktails and ambiance were impressive; however, the service did not 'wow' me.  It wasn't bad by any means, but it was not anything special.

Our table of 4 ordered: 2 Peking Duck Salads, 1 Potsticker order, 1 grilled sea bass, 2 3-cup Sea Bass dishes, 1 Braised Duck Breast, 1 Fried Rice, 1 Chow Mein, 4 cocktails (Thai Silk and Lychee Blossom), and 3 desserts (chocolate mint tart, walnut semifreddo, and mochi ice cream).  Our bill came to $345 which I think is a GREAT price for the quality of food and the fact that we all got drinks...we also weren't able to finish it all and left very satisfied.

Some reviewers commented on an ""MSG-y"" taste...we did not get that at all with any of our dishes.  All the meat dishes were cooked TO perfection and the textures and flavors were excellent.

"This place is awesome! I haven't been bowling in years, but Park Lanes makes me feel like going more often. The music is good, the drinks come quickly, and the bowling is just as fun as you remember it being as a kid. 

The food was also surprisingly good! Though I had a hard time reconciling the fact that I was sticking my fingers into borrowed bowling balls and then using those same fingers to eat chicken wings and frickles and other finger foods. Eek. Maybe they should look into providing some wet naps?

I still don't understand why I have to rent shoes from a bowling alley, but at least they don't make you trade in your kicks for one of their rental pairs.

They have live music outside, too! And just an awesome outside space -- corn hole, lots of tables for sitting and having a beer, and a prime location on Montford. Fantastic.

"Came to Topgolf for the first time for a recruitment event.  We had a great time!  From the golfing competition (apparently once someone initiates this part of the game, you get NEGATIVE points for getting your ball in the wrong hole, thanks for telling me guys), to the tasty margaritas, this was a great experience and a very cool alternative to a normal recruitment dinner.  The only thing - I wasn't much of a fan of the food.  We had some standard Mexican fare (tacos, etc.), but after having cheap legitimate Mexican taco-truck food for years, I wasn't too impressed.  I'll have to try the sushi or some other dish next time.",4.0

"My first visit here was at 10 am, and the line was crazy long (an estimated 45 minute wait) so I vowed to myself to show up earlier the next time. Second time around, I got there at 7:15 am for my egg fix. I was 2nd in line and waited around 10-12 minutes total for 2 sandwiches and a side salad. 

Whatever you select, the bread is rich and fluffy (yum!). The egg was perfectly cooked - just a touch of runny, orange yolk to compliment my bacon. I actually really enjoyed the side salad - it was simple and refreshing, and helped balance out the richness of the sandwiches. 

This will definitely stay in my permanent rotation of places to eat when I visit Vegas.",5.0

"I ate here Saturday Jan 17, 2015  grabbing a bite before my sons rugby match.  I hadn't been here in 6 years, so was a little surprised when my steak and cheese arrived and there was virtually no meat.  I think it tasted ok, but when you are just eating bread it's hard to tell.  It was $7.70 for an 8"" (medium) excluding tip which I gave prior to receiving my sub roll.  My perception would be 6oz of meat pepper onion and cheese the worse value dining since my trip to the zoo.

The positives:
The owner was super friendly, I heard she and her husband bought it two years ago, wish I knew how the value has lapsed",2.0
"Pizza with sauce on the side does not quite have the ring that cheesy bread has to it. 

We were hanging out by the pool in N Scottsdale and we needed some gluttonous food to go with beer at the swim up bar. Google suggested we call Barro's and that is just what we did.

2 orders of cheesy bread and one pizza. The cheese bread went fast too. It is essentially a pizza with the sauce on the side and cut into handy strips. Yes it was greasy, garlicky and doughy, that is what made it so good.

Delivery was fast and the food was hot.",4.0
"I have recently been traveling to Toronto for work and slowly exploring the city and discovering the different neighborhoods. Yorkville is so far my favorite..great choice of restaurants..great shopping as it's right off Bloor St...and full of all the snobby rich people Toronto has to offer.

I met with a good friend on my last trip and we came upon Amber...what drew us in was the very cool and sexy patio...it sort looked like an old back porch patio on the farm..but painted out all white with sleek chrome tables, modern chairs and benches with comfy cushions..the music was fun..remixed 70's disco with a chill element..and the servers were all beautiful and dressed in head to toe white..this place is what pretentious dreams are made of....in a good way of course..

I usually don;t expect good  service in a joint like this but my dinner date and I were pleasantly surprised by the friendly and prompt waitress that took great care of us...I hadn't even swallowed the last swig of my beer and she had replaced my bottle with a new one...that's the kind of service  I like!!

The menu was decent..not a lot of selection but some good nosh for a warm summer night on a patio...we both had the burger with seasoned fries..very yummy..not your average burger...it was a ""fancy burger"" with zucchini pickles and pickled onions..tasty none the less...

I do recommend this as a stop on a trip to Toronto..especially in the summer as the patio is the best part..the inside is equally as nice but not as fun for people watching...

My only complaint would be the prices...$60 for a burger and 2 beer is a little steep...but if you have..spend it!",4.0

Her name is Shelly and people will literally stand and wait for a seat at the bar just so she can wait on them.  I know because I am one of them!

"So I will first admit that I am a Southern Californian transplanted to Phoenix. So I am biased and I love In N Out Burgers and Fries 

I order the #1 animal style. Which for those of you who don't know the secret language that is at In N Out, that is with grilled onions, lots of pickles and spread. Oh and today I learned something about the burgers being grilled with mustard. Who knew...not ME!!

Oh and I took an Newbie, an East Coast Newbie none the less today. Guess what?!?! She loved the burger...but not the fries! I really think the fries are an acquired  taste, especially if you are a McDonald's fry fanatic...All that fake beef flavoring is hard to compete with...ya know some people just like fake flavor...not the fresh cut and fresh cooked fries that are In N Out's

The packaged items fare a bit better. The variety is limited. The prices are good as that's their niche. 
The checkout are ridiculous as there is hardly any space when a line starts to form and they do get slammed consistently. Service at checkout is particularly poor as the cashiers have an attitude like they are doing you a favor.

We threw a surprise 40th birthday party at VBGB in February of this year.  It was great!!!  I cannot say enough good things about having the party here.  I worked with Maria throughout the process and she made it very easy.

They let us reserve a private room inside the building, we were able to close the door off so the surprise guest could open the door and walk in. We were able to arrive early and decorate the room as we wanted.  

We were also sent food options and were able to have a few appetizers set up upon our arrival.  This spot was great!!  From start to finish the service was great and everyone had a wonderful time.

Even down to asking for trash bags to take some of the decorations home in they went out of their way to help us.  I cannot recommend this enough if you are looking for a spot for a group event.

"For paying such a high amount of money a month there are some things wrong with the yorkville club.

1. Members think their shit don't stink. A lot of people don't put weights in the correct place, don't clean up after themselves etc. Yeah you might pay a lot but don't expect someone following you around cleaning behind you. The weights are never in the same place which is annoying.

2. Their 24 hour fix any machine guarantee is BS, I saw a machine that was out of order for about a week or two.

3. One of the front desk attendants (really tall white brunette girl) is really rude. I always say hi in a nice way, thanks, etc and she is very cold to the point where you think did I ever offend her?

4. Every once in a while I find a moth in the showers and kill it. 

5. The shower stall I like to use usually changes direction of the hot water daily (left or right). How? I have no idea.

Mostly the problems here are attitudes of members and some employees. I used to go to a upper class gym in Montreal that was half the price and people there were much better than yorkville. Just shows that money doesn't buy you class.",3.0
"A few months ago, my hair was very long and I needed a change. I was mostly tired of the maintenance and honestly, it was getting ridiculous. Anyway, I researched several options for hair donations and discovered that Locks of Love has the only program that takes chemically-treated hair. Even if they are not able to use your hair to create the actual pieces for children, they will sell it to fund their non-profit organization. Since my hair has been colored in the past, this was perfect. So, based on my ability to donate hair, it was an easy decision to cut at least ten inches. 

I haven't had a hair stylist for a couple years, so I asked a few people for recommendations. My friend Hally told me how much she loves her stylist, Kelly, based on several successful appointments and I was convinced! We coincidentally booked consecutive appointments on the same day, so I was able to watch Kelly in action while she was doing Hally's hair before it was my turn.

When I sat down in Kelly's chair, I explained that I wanted to cut off a lot and needed it neatly done for my donation. I left everything else up to her. She asked what type of hair style I wanted and I said, ""I don't know. I just don't want long hair anymore."" Then, Kelly created a ponytail and after some consultation, we decided on a little over 12 inches to be removed (about 13-14 inches after everything). Before she began cutting, she asked if I was sure I wanted to do it - I couldn't wait to part with my hair. It was liberating and even without an actual trim, I was happy with the way shorter hair looked! From there, we settled on a shoulder-length asymmetrical cut that wasn't too dramatic with light side-swept bangs. She added some mellow highlights, then straightened and styled my hair. I absolutely LOVE the way it turned out!! I couldn't stop looking at it or touching it. That's success!

Although I enjoyed my short hair, it wasn't very versatile in styling. So, I am growing my hair out again until inspiration strikes. When it does, I am absolutely coming back to Kelly. There is no doubt in my mind. I highly recommend her to everyone! Oh, and bonus: her services are very inexpensive!!",5.0

"I have been using SHPR for approximately three years to board my two 50-55 lb dogs. I have never had an issue with them until now. Although their prices have steadily increased over the years and most things require additional fees, I have never complained, until now; however, I have questioned whether this place is worth the money that I have spent with them, which is probably well over a couple thousand dollars over the last few years. 

Here is my story: 
My two dogs have always used the Pavilion Patio Suite together. I love that they are able to have out door space, especially when they are kenneled 24x7. Last time we boarded, they were out of the Pavilion Patio Suite, so we took an Elite Patio Suite. This time when I called to book 6 nights, I was told that my dogs were too large to share the Pavilion Patio Suite and MUST be in at least an Elite Suite. I have never had this issue before. I was told that such things must be approved by management and a day later I received a call that management had declined my request, as the dogs would be more comfortable in the Elite Suite. 

I would not have such an issue with this, except that I really feel this is a money issue. The the Elite Suite is actually only 7'X7', while the Patio Pavilion Suite is 2 spaces of  4 1/2'x7', equaling more space than the Elite Suite. The Elite Suite is even slightly cheaper; however, I made it clear that I really want the outdoor space, therefore, my only option is the Elite Patio Suite, which is $15 more per night ($105 more for my entire trip). Additionally, the website states that the Pavilion Patio Suite is good for dogs up to 100 lbs and my dogs are either at 100 lbs or just over by 5-10 lbs (combined). I think it is completely silly that they are so wrapped up in 5-10 lbs (max) of a difference and they are willing to lose a good customer.

I will state that I feel that ultimately, my issues lie with management, not the individuals who are in non-managment roles. I feel that management is loosing a good customer over a silly issue, and have used their employees to relay a message that really should have come from management, but I am holding firm and have found another place to board my dogs. Additionally, please don't state that you feel this is in the best interest of my dogs, when really this really seems to be about how to get more money out of the customer. 

I have since canceled my reservation and found a new place which will not only be saving me $200, but also allows my dogs to participate in open play all day, rather than being cooped up in a small room/kennel. Sure my new place doesn't have flat screen TV's that play Animal Planet, but it provides my dogs with all the necessities and a chance to meet and play with other doggie friends without additional costs.",2.0

If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd be making weekly (maybe even daily) journeys to the store.

"Great service, ambience, and drinks. However, I cannot see this restaurant lasting very long unless they make some necessary changes to their menu. Chefs at crujientes, please take notice. 

Short rib taco: meat too dry for a taco, not enough sauce and lacks boldness. Use blanco tacos short rib taco as reference. 

Crab taco: seemed like a crab salad that was formed in a stick and fried, kind of like a crab cake taco. Love crab cakes but for a taco, the crab should not be diluted with mayo and excessive ingredients. Keep the crab meat whole and simple. A fried stick of crab cake makes a strange taco filling, customers want that nice natural crab flavor to be in front of all the other flavors. 

Pork belly taco: needs a bolder sauce within the minced pork belly.  

Price: too high for the size of street tacos. I know a fantastic taco place not too far from your restaurant and it serves the best street tacos I've ever had for $1 each. Unless you give customers a reason to pick crujientes over blanco or the nearby restaurant I mentioned, say goodbye to your clientele. Both of these places are currently cheaper and better. 

You all have a great concept, just some modifications to price and food and you'll be well on your way.",3.0

"I was reading through the reviews and people were complaining about the price. It really isn't expensive compared to other Shabu places I've been to. There are plenty that will cost you $50+ to get the same amount of food as their geisha size. Just saying.
I've been a fan of Yojie since I lived in CA - it was also the less expensive of the choices for shabu. I must say this location out does itself. From decorations to menu to even the restrooms. Yes I am loving the restroom. Concrete walls! So modern. Waterfall sink. ooo fancy
Menu definitely is bigger here than the CA locations. The Salmon tho!!! You have to try it. I MEAN IT. TRY THE SALMON!!! It is sashimi grade so you can eat it raw and I sure did eat that thing raw. With or without the sauce. I drool just thinking about it.
For all you cheapskates out there, get the combo plates, you get more meat that way. And if you didn't know rice and sauce come with refills. That's right FREE REFILLS ON RICE AND SAUCES. Or you can take your cheap butt to melting pot and let see you say yojie is expensive after.",4.0

"Hot Taco's overall rating on Yelp is pretty low, which I think is unfortunate. Personally, I've had several positive experiences there. Now, don't get me wrong... it's not outstanding by any means, but still, I'd say it's good and we go pretty regularly on Tuesdays. This is probably my favorite part about this place... Taco Tuesdays. All their tacos are $2 each, and they have a Mexican beer that is $2 as well as $2 margaritas (smaller than normal but still a decent size). Dinner (and drinks?!) for $8? I'll be there. 

Other things that I like - they recently added a salsa bar with 6 or 7 different types of salsa. It's got a really great avocado salsa, plus some others that aren't necessarily unique but still, variety is good and I think this new addition really kicks the whole place up a notch. Also, tacos can be served on corn, flour, or lettuce wraps. I personally go for the lettuce and I haven't seen many other places around town offer that as an option.   

Cons - service can be a little slow and parking there on the weekends can be tricky sometimes. But, overall, a good spot.",4.0

They have fresh made mini donuts which made the store smoky but it smelled really good.",5.0
"Have been to Lago on multiple occasions, and now will never go back.  I purchased a deal from Living Social where $40 gave you $80.  After we ate our meal and presented the printed coupon, we were told by the manager that they were not accepting these coupons from Living Social.  He told us that Living Social set the deal up illegally and they would not honor the coupon.  We were also told that we should have received an email informing us of this, and that our $40 should have been refunded to our credit card by Living Social.  We received no email, and certainly no refund.  I took exception to the notion that the Lago manager repeatedly took the stance that it was Living Social that made the error, and they were doing nothing wrong by insisting we pay the full amount of the bill.  It was, and still is, my feeling that Lago certainly could have taken ownership of this situation, and taken care of our meal.  Shoot, even if they'd posted a small sign at the entrance that Living Social coupons weren't being honored it would have been better.  After all, Lago entered into the agreement with Living Social as a method of attracting new business.  Unfortunately, to take the stance  that they were completely blamelss and nothing was owed to us was a slap in the face to to us, who were, until now, repeat customers.  In the spirit of customer service, this should have been handled differently, and as a result I will never visit Lago again.  There are many great places to eat in Cleveland besides Lago, and I'm sure they will appreciate my business.",1.0

"The good: so much original stuff inside, cool old bar stools, etc. In recent years the outside has gotten a lot more curb appeal too. The coffee is great. The waitresses are friendly. The food is better than average. The bad? Just one thing: DIRTY. Dirty as in they need to close the restaurant for two days, get some hot soapy water and bleach and cleaners, start on one end and make their way to the other. Is that so hard? I like this place and it has potential, it's definitely one of the oldest historic places in North Olmsted, but when you sit down for breakfast and have the urge to grab cleaners and towels and wipe down the blinds at your table, that's no good. They really, really need to WIPE IT DOWN and clean the place top to bottom. If they did that I would say it's worthy of five stars. I hope the owners read this and take it to heart but I doubt they will. It's a shame!",3.0

"I live in the neighborhood, this is my closest post office. I cannot believe how incredibly rude and snotty these workers really are...I never have the same postage carrier twice, they don't come at any consistent time, they don't pick up my packages unless I go online and order a pick up, they don't always take my envelopes to go out. They NEVER attempt to knock to deliver a package (I work from home, so trust---I know this.) Going into the post office is like the BMV/DMV, the workers are straight up antagonistic and rude. I always approach the experience with a good attitude, I want to be wrong, but it always unravels before my eyes. I had a certified package that they NEVER LEFT NOTICE FOR come to my home, by the time I knew it was at the post office, I was beyond the 15 day deadline. I legitimately wondered how I go about getting that letter after the time period ends. I ask, ""ok, what do I do now?"" the guy says to me, DEAD SERIOUS,  ""Maybe don't wait 15 days to pick up a certified package."" Thanks. THANK YOU, d*ckhead. I could NOT believe I received such a snotty answer, one that I honestly did not provoke. At my last home, for two years in a row, I tipped my postal carrier $100 because no matter what day, no matter the weather or circumstance, he dutifully took EVERY piece of mail (somedays it was upwards of 25 outgoing packages) I ever needed and he was an actual human being who would do the right thing.

They don't have any dogs and sometimes they have a few cats. The birds there are adorable and well taken care of the cages are always clean. Same for the rest of the pets at this location. 

The staff there really knows how to help you out. If the person you ask a question to doesn't know the answer, they quickly get another staff member who always knows more about all their products then you ever could imagine. 

I've never had a bad experience at this location and all the pets they do have are in clean cages and are well taken care of.",5.0
"Had fish and chips (Halibut). The service was friendly, the food was good and price reasonable. The fish could have been bigger but still reasonable. 

I don't like how they serve the coleslaw and gravy in small plastic containers, is kinda tacky. Also the bottom of that fish and chips plate was a newspaper like thin paper which got really torn apart with the food moisture; I think I accidentally ate a piece of the paper with my food :(

Overall a solid 3 star.",3.0
"Not a good donut but not a bad donut.  The donuts are okay at best.  Someone told me I don't know if it's true that the donuts are frozen and shipped from different   location.  I think this might be true because they don't taste fresh.  The coffee was very good.

In a nutshell this place will do in a pinch.",3.0
"Great museum and fun place to bring the family especially during the summer. I have been here twice already with my girls and family and it doesn't disappoint. There are several floors and exhibits to see and interact with. Not only does the museum have an impressive dinosaur display, but also local culture, space, geology, gold mining, dinosaur bone digging, and history. The small indoor play area that has a tree tunnel slide is a great way for the kids to burn off energy while indoors. I have driven about an hour to get here and think it is worth the drive. My 2.5 and 6.5 year olds both love it and call it the dinosaur museum. Highly recommend bringing your kids and family.",5.0

"Freestone Park is a must-visit if you live in or near, or are visiting Gilbert. The 100-acre grounds are beautiful, featuring a man-made lake and waterfall. An 1880's replica miniature railroad takes a quarter-mile loop around the lake, affording a views of ducks and geese. Bring some bread if you dare (the ducks can be quite aggressive!).

There are numerous picnic armadas, several separate playground areas -- so if one play area is being dominated by a snot-nosed bully, you can always move to a safer one. 

There are also basketball courts, sand volleyball pits, batting cages and a driving range, and a 22,000 square feet skate park.

But wait! That's not all! There's also an antique carousel, mini-ferris wheel, and a tot-sized ""wave runner."" Although there is a fee for the train, batting cages, golf & the rides, it is on par or below what other equivalent amusements usually cost. 

Finally Freestone Park is an excellent place to slide down grassy hills on an ice block. Of course, that activity isn't officially sanctioned, so try-at-your-own risk :)",5.0
The ladies in the front were very unprofessional. We came in to get a few things for a cookout. One of the items was a malt beverage. Well after both ladies looked over the malt beverage they told me and my wife we can't sale wine coolers on Sunday. They both weren't sure whether it was a malt beverage or a wine cooler. Me and wife got frustrated because this same lady(btw she looked like she just got out of bed with a scarf on her head)is always slow and difficult to deal with at the register. So after her and the other lady were having trouble figuring out what it was they were about to call a manager but we were so frustrated we left out and as we were leaving they told us to call Rite Aid. Well that's exactly what we did. Well the lady with the scarf answered the phone and when I asked for a manager she gave the phone to the lady that was next to her and she told me she was the manager. But I told her both of you were about to call the manager now your the manager? Yeah ok. I'm never going there again and that Rite Aid is right by where my parents stay.,1.0

"I was watching this show with my bf kinda like celebrating the Vday since it's a combination of comedy and magic show, so it sounds pretty interesting!  The show itself was not bad, great for family (especially if kids are tagging along).  However, the reason I only gave 3 stars was because I was originally brought two tickets via Groupon which I got a decent prices for 2.  I even called to RSVP on 2/14 and upgraded to VIP seats.  The operator that I talked to was like since you have already upgraded your seats, there's no need to be line up and get there around  10-15 minutes before the show starts (show time was at 4pm).  So my bf and I got there at like 3:35pm and the front desk was like sorry ""ALL GROUPON TICKETS NEED TO LINE UP NO MATTER IF YOU HAVE THE GA OR ALREADY UPGRADED TO VIP""....i m like what the....Saxe Theater needs to have a better training with the phone operators, not like asking customers to upgrade but afterward, it's all on your!",3.0

"My first appt was a complete waste of time & money... They overbook their appointments, so I had to wait 1.5 hours past my scheduled appt time.
I paid my $50.00 ""specialty doctor"" co-pay when I arrived... 1.5 hours later, Dr. Shahzad walked in for maybe 60 seconds. He took one look at me, insisted on new blood work & a new appt.
I rescheduled, left, got new blood work as soon as I could & returned for my second scheduled appt. After another ridiculously long wait & $50.00 co-pay, I finally saw the Dr for 2 whole minutes!
He put me on Synthroid, which I started right away & all my symptoms became 10x worse, to the point of wanting to just die. So of course I knew he was not the doctor for me.

"I would never go back to this restaurant. We came here with our kids in the late afternoon. The restaurant was filthy. The floor was covered in food crumbs and garbage. The glass windows to the kids play area was smeared and disgusting. There was food on the seats. It was so bad that I actually mentioned it to the boy who brought our food. He said he would clean it up. He came back with a broom and dust pan and proceeded to sweep up the larger items of garbage and that was it. He did not clean thoroughly at all. When our food arrived the chicken nuggets for the kids were so small that it was ridiculous. The people working there were friendly enough but I was grossed out by how dirty it was.

"Richardson's is consistently a very good restaurant.  I always find myself here with out of town guests who have never visited Phoenix, and most of the time everyone is happy.  The only thing that prevents 5 stars in my book is my most recent experience last night.  Two people in our large table ordered the same adovada dish and one person's had two tortillas on it and the other person's only had one.  No big deal.  The person who had only one tortilla asked for more and they brought out 4 more tortillas without question.  We were all happy campers.  Looking at the bill later, however, it turns out that the waiter charged our group for two side dishes of tortillas at $2 each ($4 total).  I know we are in the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression and the restaurant needs to make money, but that equated to $1 per extra tortilla.  Talk about nickel and diming.  I will, however, give our waiter kudos for working with me to make the New Mexican Platter vegetarian.  It was delicious, as usual.",4.0
"I didn't expect much going to this airport since it was last minute. Also, I only have a paper copy of my ID and I have my credit card. They asked for 3 pieces of ID to confirm identity. I was given the green to go though however there was an extensive check afterwards. I was happy for that honestly because it made me feel secure and protected. I hate airport check on but this one was smooth. While I was being patted down I was glad the procedure was described in full before I was touched. While I was being search I had a conversation with TSA & I didn't feel so violated. We know how that can be at airports. I waited and everything seemed pleasant. I will say... I missed my flight they mentioned they called me on loud speaker but I never heard my name called. I could've been distracted. Nevertheless the issue was fixed no extra charge and no hassle. I stayed in the airport overnight because i didn't want to g through TSA again. I was uncomfortable not to many spaces to stretch out so I sat on the floor no one bothered me and the men who fix the lights and things were extremely polite and considerate.

"I'm originally from Holland and love our greenbelt here.  As good as you can get in the US for safe cycling and low risk.  AZ unfortunately is well-known for its lack of cell phone laws and the roads are treacherous.  Having a safer path for my commute from Cactus and 101 to ASU and back is a huge opportunity to stay as fit as possible.  

My only complaint is the timing of grass watering in many of the parks.  Oftentimes in the morning light when folks are out and about and because of the flood zone location of the path, water accumulates on the path itself.  By watering late evening or early AM, perhaps the paths would be more clear when the lights come on.  

CAUTION: for cyclists - those puddles are common accumulation points obviously and underneath the surface, mud.  I crossed a 4"" wide patch of watch at a slight turn and dumped hard on the concrete.  A lot of road rash.  3M's Tegaderm patch is my friend!!!

Overall, I love our green belt.  We bought our house because of its proximity to the path and will always factor this distance if we ever move.  If the City of Scottsdale continues with similar pathway growth, it will continue to reign as a 1st class city!!

Love this green belt!",5.0

You can get a combo for $10, tax in which is a steal. Combo comes with chicken/beef shawarma sandwich, salad or fries and a pop. 
Considering its a take out place, service was super friendly and efficient. Sandwich was HUGE and stuffed with so many toppings and generous amount of chicken. Toppings were fresh and plentiful.

Will definitely come back for this combo when I'm craving shawarma. Maybe it's a good thing that it's out of the way, otherwise I would be here too often",5.0

"The food is bomb. Atomic style. 

Ok, it's not spicy at all, but it is freaking delicious.

I had one hell of a goose chase trying to find some chinese food on this weeknight. It's past 9PM on a Monday, and I can't find anything decent. It's Scottsdale, so my only choices are: Panda Express in Mesa, Jimmy Woo's (no thanks, eww), or go hungry. I settled, and drove to KFC thinking that if I was going to settle for something other than Chinese, I could get a double down, and try and go all suicidal. 

Then KFC let me down by forcing me to wait 10 minutes because all their filets were frozen. Eff that noise. I drove around aimlessly and somehow stumbled upon Pita House. It was like a sight for sore eyes.

I've lived in Scottsdale for just over a year. I've been out and about in the area quite a bit, but for some reason I've never actually been to the Pita House. Probably because it does look a little weird. 

I guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, because this place was awesome.

Tonight, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with an extra chicken skewer. It came with a side salad. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very thick garlic sauce (very similar to the one at Zankou Chicken in LA, see my review). Amazing. So garlicky, citrusy, and perfect.

The chicken was moist and juicy. The kind that makes you want to put your mouth all up in it. Mmm hmm. Yeah. It's very nice.

My meal was about 10 bucks. I devoured everything set in front of me. 

If you are into Hookah, they have hookah specials from 4-9, and also, some sort of lunch special for Gyros.

If I wasn't moving away, I'd be here more often.

Next time I am in Scottsdale, I will eat here, and grab some Falafel. Seems like people like it.

Lastly, the staff seems very nice. The guy who helped me (I think he was the owner) was super cool and friendly.",5.0

"I chose this place purely for the previous reviews. They were wonderful in service! I went in at 11am.. no one else there but myself and another patron. But why did a mani/pedi take over 2 hours.  I can see 90 min, but not over 2 hours. 

My pedi.. the guy did a great job, good shop talk, took his time and my nails looked amazing. My mani on the other hand... not so great. They had another older woman clean my nails and she filed so much that she started filing my finger tip...(ouch!) and it was uneven... no matter how many times she tried to fix it. Then someone else came to do the polish... started with the tips in then another gentleman finished the polish. It almost seemed like they were rushing because there were many more customers in the shop now. Then he started telling me how he and his gf had to go to the dmv etc... probably as to why he was late... blah blah blah. Due to labor day weekend and her license expiring the day before labor day... it was a big to do apparently.... but... what about my nails? Top coat finally being put on after 2 hours in the shop and my family is now calling me wondering where I am and why it has taken this long. 

It's not like I got a hot towel treatment or gel or no chip manicure... just your run of the mill manicure with cleaning etc... 

End result... disastrous! An hour later... bubbles bubbles bubbles galore!

We visit here often whilst on vacation/holiday. It's just around the corner from where we stay and the cafe serves some good diner style food. Tonight we ordered the calamari special to share, then both opted for the southern fried chicken basket. The calamari was a mix of rings and babies, which was fine for us. I prefer rings, and the OH prefers the babies. The chicken was very nice, with a tasty crunch to the coating, and no excess grease. The chicken came with fries and coleslaw, both were good. On this occasion we had a wait of 35 minutes to be seated. The desk person gives you a little buzzer, which goes off when your table is ready. We whiled away the time by playing a few slots and watching the football fans in the sports book get excited. It was quite entertaining, and the time went quickly.",4.0
"ahhh finally, someone brought over a popular restaurant style from Japan & Hong Kong to Toronto.  This place is very good and the food they serve is very unique, I don't recall seeing a similar style in Toronto prior to Aka Teppan. The selling point of this place is the way they bring the food onto the table, the meat is not fully cooked yet, and the customer can play a little chef and grill the meat to perfection (usually another minute or two should be good) and mix it at your own will.  So this style can be a double edged swords, some will like it, some will not.

There is nothing special about the envionment as it is very typical looking, so let's go straight to the food.  They serve a variety of foods, but mainly either a form of topping on either rice or pasta.  I tried both and I prefer the pasta option, reason being you can choose your own sauce and the ""Hand Grilled Pepper"" saurce is by far one of the best!  Very strong buttery smell and flavour and I personally love that smell and taste!  If you prefer the rice instead, I will recommend the Hamburger Steak, very tender and just by grilling it a bit more it's perfect!

I should also mention their desserts, very creative and although i know where that tiramisu in a pot idea came from, but props to them for bringing it over and doing a good job on it!

Although the price is at the high end, but I would still recommend people trying out this place, for the experience and the quality of the food they serve.",4.0

Unfortunately those are the only positive reviews I can provide.  I chose to see a dermatologist over a primary physician because of skin conditions that run in my family. However, now I realize I should have gone to see a primary care doctor. The doctor did not ask about family history or any additional questions. He simply looked very briefly at the spot of concern and provided topical samples. While he obviously has more knowledge than myself, and the spot probably is nothing to worry about, I left feeling as if I wasted his time. His attitude resembled one that did not want to there. I contemplated asking about a couple moles, but he seemed to be in such a hurry to get out of there that I chose against asking any questions.

"Loving all these ramen joints in Toronto! One of my goals is to try all the ramens in this city. Although I had many bowls of ramen in Japan, Korea, and Canada, I still don't have a clear idea of how to rate them. They are all different. It all comes down to personal preference....
 When I saw chicken ramen on the menu, I had to give it a try because I love trying unique dishes (same reason for trying tomato ramen at Sansotei :P).

It was very flavourful! Noodles were cooked on point. I also tried their pork ramen (my bf's order) which was also flavourful and rich. We sat at the bar where you can see chefs preparing ramen. Quick and friendly service like any other Japanese ramen places!

Overall, it was not the best ramen I had, but certainly solid food. The biggest pro for Kinton Ramen is that they have several locations throughout the city, so no need to line up or travel far to taste their ramen. I don't know if there is a huge difference between different locations (apparently Sansotei locations do have a huge difference, downtown one being better than the one in uptown).

"Ate there on Saturday. Went in and saw 5 tables in the place and hostess greeted me and said 5 minute wait, goofed around for 5 minutes, then sat us. There were literally 5 tables in the whole place.  I looked at the menu and saw that the Admiral Feast went up in price from 16.49 to 19.99. When I got the food, WOW, it was Sooooo Small. Let's start with the details, there were 3 tiny pieces of fish in which 1 of them was half empty of the fish and the breeding remained, there were 7 shrimps that were pretty good, there were literally 8 pieces of fried clams, 10 extra small Scallops that were soggy and wet, and the last was the French fries which were pretty good. So, I complained and the Manager brought me 3 new pieces of fish and it was very good. As for the scallops and the clams, they were good but as I said, the price was way up and the portions were way smaller than usual. I only order the same thing when I go and I know how much the cost is and the portions by heart. I spent 20.00 for 7 shrimp, 5.5 pieces of fish in which I got after complaining of empty batter, and really good French Fries. The rest were merely tasters, oh and I forgot the cheese biscuits, I love the cheese biscuits. I know prices went up but to raise the price 4 dollars and reduce the portions to half, is just cheating. I went from once or twice a week, to once a month, to every 2-3 months, to probably never after this trip. Get it together while you still can!!!

Now...the true test of a boba house - the quality of its tapioca! Some places have pearls that are too mushy, some don't cook em quite long enough and end up soft on the outside but too firm on the inside, leaving you a tooth-sticking mess while chewing (try not to smile during). 

Boba Tea House has near-perfect pearls. Not too soft (you can still use them as missiles should you choose as they do not stick to the straw), not too hard (your jaw won't ache). 

As the pearls are my favorite part of boba teas, this fact alone earns them five stars in my book! The first time I went here I'd lived in Gilbert for about 3 months. I was a bit depressed because school is all-consuming, and I was really homesick for SF food. I wasn't expecting much. After popping the plastic cap with my over-sized straw and taking that oh-so-satisfying first suck 'n' chew, my eyes teared and I knew I'd eventually find my gastronomic place here.

All hail Boba Tea House!",5.0
"(disclaimer: This is solely a review of the Tim Hortons drive thru at this OnRoute, as that is the only component I experienced).

So I waited in a long line to get tea and a bagel from the drive thru. Here is a rough transcript of my experience.

*pulls up car to window*
*silence, blank screen.*
me: :S
*I roll my car up a few inches in case I missed a sensor or something*
*silence, blank screen.*
*after a minute* person: ...Yeah, what?
Me: Oh, hi! Could I get a medium steeped tea, one milk, 2 sugars please.
Person: That it?
Me: Do you have any pretzel bagels?
Person: *sounding irritated* How do you want it??
Me: Uhh toasted with butter, please.
*screen still blank*
Person: $3.05, drive through.

....huh? Who took away those nice drive thru employees of many Toronto locations, who are polite and answered questions properly and repeated your order back to you?? I guess it doesn't matter whether they act pleasant or totally rude, they are still going to get a constant flow of commuters in need of a caffeine fix.",1.0
"Sometimes you hit magic. You know what I mean, that hole-in-the-wall joint that where you would never think to walk in the door, but somehow (for whatever reason), you go in that door, order some food, and you experience some of  the most amazing food that you've had in a long time.. e.g. Rollin' Smoke BBQ, Fat Choy etc...

OK, this is not one of those places.

This review is for the Asian/American cafe that is located inside of the casino. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but sometimes, it just needs to happen (if you don't believe me, go in this place and check it out).

I personally thought that we have moved past this type of food. Maybe like 20 years ago this might have been accepted as mediocre food, but now, I,Don't, Think, So!

I was thinking about giving this place 2 stars because the cashier lady was so friendly. And, she seemed genuinely concerned about making sure that I was alright. But, the food was speaking loudly too me, it was actually SHOUTING at me! So, here we go...

5$ Pho: Ok, lets talk about the broth. I'm talking Top Ramen here peeps. Like, water + powdered soup base. That's it. Mental picture here. Noodles: Pad Thai noodles. It looks like they weren't soaked and cooked properly, or possibly they were old because they had that slight woody taste.. The rare beef? Overcooked, well done (meaning past medium)  thick slices of flavorless beef. Finally, cilantro on top. That's all folks. Plus, i've had a tender stomach last night and the whole day today.

The owners seemed very nice so it pains me to do this. But I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I've been very fortunate to hit a lot of bullseye's in my foodie quest in Vegas. I've also hit some ducks along the way. Quack muthatruckin' Quack!",1.0

"This steakhouse was pretty decent. Everything was cooked to how we liked it but there just wasn't any wow factor. I felt it was a bit over priced for what we got while comparing to other steakhouses. Honestly, it really wasn't any better than Outback Steakhouse.

"This is a boutique style hotel by a main line hotel (Marriott) and from first glance, they seemed to have hit their target market nicely. This is clearly aimed at millennials and caters to how they live and interact. First, the check in is at a bar, and they offer you a free house drink when you arrive. The lobby has free games, pool, pinball etc and lots of communal areas. 

The decor is quite neat and the elevator is set up to take selfies- interesting. The rooms items are very comfortable and tastefully decorated. There is an actual working guitar and record player in the room. My room has vinyl from Miles Davis and James Brown, which is really neat.

As a business traveler, I look for a couple of things: comfortable bed, work space, ironing board and hangars. The bed is great, the room is clean and a good work space. They have removed the ironing board and made a communal ironing room- not for my taste. There isn't a closet or dresser, instead you are given pegs on a wall with a couple of hangars. Lastly, they use community soap, meaning one big bottle that stays between stays versus mini bottles. I person alt hate this in the shower unless I know they have been sanitized- and these do not show that. 

The room doesn't have a clock and the TV has about 5 channels, but it appears you can stream to the TV from your device. The lighting is nice and adequate and the bathroom is above expectations.

Lastly, the staff are all friendly and helpful.",5.0
Friendly employees. They were knowledgeable about the design of the different products and the differences among them. The cashier had great attention to detail and notified me (even tho the tag already said it on certain items) which items were final sale asking me if that was okay. Their bags that you get when you buy something are great quality and the large ones can be used as reusable grocery bags. Clean well organised store. Small men's section in front right and then unisex items in the center of the store. Fitting rooms available.,5.0

"Whatever you do, DO NOT chose this place to do business with! I called them when my refrigerator went out to see if I could have someone fix it. When I first called, the ""owner"" seemed to be concerned & acted as if he really wanted to help, so he ""rushed"" to get one of his ""guys"" out an hour later! I was thrilled & excited that someone was willing to come out so quickly! Long story short...the guy came out ""fixed"" the fridge & charged me $400 & left. He claimed I had a 90 day warranty. A few days later my fridge went out again, so I called & the owner said that it wasn't his problem, & to call the guy who fixed it! Ugh??? I argued with him, that I couldn't get ahold of the guy & that it's his contractor! He said that wasn't his problem & the guy who did the fridge didn't work for him!! Why would he send a guy that doesn't work for him, to do a job? Bottom line, I got nowhere & the owner is horrible, & has horrible customer service! It's fraud!!!

"Since my first visit to eat. I was dying to come back. I love everything about this little breakfast and lunch spot in Downtown Las Vegas. Customer service was just as good the second time around. I had to have the pancakes again and luckily, they serve pancakes all day now instead of just for breakfast because I went a little later in the day. They had this tasty new thing on the menu-deep fried deviled eggs! 

It's great to see the new Container Park across the street because there wasn't much of a view the last time I was in town. This will always be my go-to breakfast spot in Vegas. They're always busy but the wait's usually not long to get seated and for the food to come out. Customer service is great and the food is even greater.",5.0
The food and service was great until the owner of the place came up to our table and was absolutely rude to us about using more than 2 credit cards for a party of 11. We had no idea we couldn't use more than 2 cards and there was no point of her yelling at our table and showing how sad and ungrateful she was for anyone dining there. She ruined our entire experience here. I would never come back because of the way she approached us and even was rude until we left by talking to other patrons about us. So rude.,1.0
"This place was amazing!  Went there for breakfast 3 days in a row it was so good.  The staff was so friendly and the food speaks for itself.  They have amazing breakfast specials that go until 11am.  Delicious coffee, fresh locally grown produce and high quality ingredients make this a must if you are in the Las Vegas area.  Their customer service was great, which to me is very important.  This place is a homerun in my eyes!",5.0
"Deviled eggs.  Omg!! Not in the menu but delicious! Also, freshly squeezed oj was so refreshing.  Shrimp and grits was super tasty but shrimp could use a bit more seasoning.

"Never thought I'd be writing a review on my college campus, but here goes...

The great thing about attending CSN for a few classes is the fact that they have 3 CAMPUSES: Cheyenne, Charleston, and Henderson. So you can pretty much choose a campus that accommodates your needs in terms of your location in the valley. So its easy to assume I chose to attend one of my 3 classes here at this campus because I work in the Henderson area =)

This campus is not nearly as big as Cheyenne or the Charleston one, but that's fine. I mean.. If you're attending CSN you're obviously not trying to go for big and fancy otherwise you would have chose classes at UNLV or go out of state, haha. This campus pretty much gets the job done. It's pretty small, but there's a good range of parking.

It's located right near a freeway which allows for easy access. I never have trouble finding parking here compared to when I went to the Charleston campus and I had a class there at the same time. 

Overall.. This place gets the job done.",3.0

"Loved it! First time trying ube anything! Ordered the ube waffle with ube Thai rolled ice cream and meat lovers pizza egg waffle. 

This is a small mom and pop shop on the second level of the TNT plaza. The owners are very sweet. The man gave me the metal holder for my ube so I could take a photo. He knew!

The order took about 15 minutes to make. I paid cash. 

The ube waffle and ice cream had a subtle flavour. I wished there was more flavour, but as this is my first time trying ube, I'm not sure if it could be more powerful. I loved the Thai rolled ice cream. They did a great job rolling it. The egg waffle was crispy and soft.

I liked the pizza a lot. The sausage had a lot of flavour. The salty flavour of the pizza ingredients overpowered the egg waffle sweetness, which I liked.  We paid $10 and got a pop with it. The owner said ""it's not complete without a coke"". Not sure if this comes with the order, but he was right, the coke hit the spot with the pizza! 

The food is expensive here. We paid $23, but it's very big and filling so we didn't mind. 

Beware it can get messy so take some tissues! 
There's no place to sit here, but we went to arcade area at the middle end of the plaza to chow down.",4.0

"Giving the ol' cow a break, I wanted to switch things up from the usual beed pho and tried a noodle soup with seafood. Not quite sure what I was expecting, maybe a spicy or otherwise potent broth but it came with a light/clear broth. The broth has a light oniony sweetness to it that was quite pleasing. It could very well have been the same as pho broth but regardless, not bad at all. Squid, fish balls, and one shrimp, as well as onion and green onion, fried shallot, bean sprouts and garlic chives rounded out the dish. Piping hot broth alone puts it above the other pho places in the area.",4.0

I also got th tabbouleh because of many people's recommendation. I think it was way too sour for me and a little too dry. the portion size was very generous, but I probably won't come here unless I need something quick and ready to go. I'm also kinda curious about their desserts so maybe ill stop by next time to try the sweets.",3.0
Came for the weekend and It was pretty great everyone is helpful. I wanted to give a big THANK YOU to Francisco! He was I think the head of house keeping( I think). Long story short my friend LOST  her ID in the room. Her flight was going to leave in about three hours so it was crucial for her to find it. Francisco went above and beyond to try and find it. He FOUND IT !!!!! In the TRASH... mind you this was after they had already cleaned the room and taken the trash out of the room which means he had to go to the trash room to find it.

"We stumbled across Bonus Round a few months ago on accident and have been back now a number of times. The strip mall it's in doesn't look like much, but trust me, the bar is fun and unique. On top of the free arcade games, board games and console, they actually have an interesting drink menu with custom cocktails and from what my husband affirms, a decent beer menu. 

The only negative is that at any given time at least a few of the arcade games don't work. Yes they're free, but when you sit down with your drink excited to battle your husband in a California dreaming car race, only to find that your steering wheel doesn't turn, disappointment abounds. Even if there was just a small sign they could put on those having issues, it would set better expectations. 

That aside, I'd highly recommend Bonus Round if you're looking for a laid back, neighborhood bar with a twist!",4.0

"I've been going to Donna for the past 4 years while studying in medical school (just graduated, and sad to leave). I need to have a professional-looking haircut and Donna has never disappointed! She is an outstanding hair stylist! My initial impressions haven't changed since I first started getting my haircut from her: 
-From the moment you meet her, she is super friendly and easy to talk to. This was such an important point for me because you need someone who can understand EXACTLY what you want in your haircut! (Pro tip: always bring a picture!) She also checks in with you mid-haircut to make sure everything is the right length, etc. Also, she's fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin!
-She has been cutting hair for years and it's obvious she knows how to cut different styles using different techniques! She also has a lot of experience fixing bad haircuts from other places. Great skills and professional equipment! Works frequently with both men and women.
-She is professional - her place is always kept very clean and she keeps good track of her appointments. I basically never have to wait, but when I do on very rare occasions, it's for less than 5 minutes. Also, she's very courteous about taking your jacket and responding to any requests.

"I like to eat very basic foods and ramen bar does the basics right. I used to just get the ramen ramen but I've since discovered their wontons, so I now get the wonton men in a shoyu base with an egg. I get the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts on the side and no green onion because I do not like to mix anything with my noodles but meat. The pork slices are average, but the wontons are simple and delicious, the filling is just a solid piece of soft meat and both go great with the noodles.  The noodles are nice and firm and perfectly cooked, and go well with all of the meats and the egg. Even their boiled egg is so good I started to make my eggs like they do. The broth is so delicious that I can't resist the urge to sit and sip on it while waiting for my friends to finish even though I know it's unhealthy and I'm already really full.

"This place is AWESOME! My brother lives in Phoenix and on my visit to him he told me this place was a must to go to before I would have to return to New York. We went on my last night in Arizona and it felt pretty magical. The waitress sat us right next to the window and we had a gorgeous view of the sun setting and Pinnacle Peak. I love the chopped off ties and next visit will bring an old tie just so it can join the mass.

When we got to the restaurant we were seated right away. I got up to use the bathroom, it was huge! Thank goodness a restaurant/bar finally got it right. Big bathrooms=no lines. 

On my way back I stumbled upon the restaurants rattlesnakes. Yes, live rattlesnakes. The baby, properly named Junior was all in a huss over me and coiled up and rattled that tail. What an awesome thing to behold. The mother could care less that I was there (and was probably sleeping). They look well cared for and it was a special treat to observe the beauty of wildlife.

I ordered a prickly pear margarita (we don't have those in NY XD) and I ordered the combo which was simply steak and chicken. My steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare. It cut like butter and wasn't smothered with seasonings or sauce. The chicken was fantastic as well. I was thoroughly delighted with both of them. 

My margarita was delicious! I've only ever had cactus candy that my brother brought for me on his visits back home to NY and it tasted like that in margarita form. This would be my go-to drink if I lived out here. I miss it already.

"Very disappointed,  I went on their website and their menu looked delicious and I expected a lot (my mistake) I went in to the restaurant at 8pm (an hour before closing) and they were packed up ready to go home.  That should have been my clue.  I ordered their veggie burger,  chicken sandwich and fish sandwich.  When I get home I open the burgers and I was horrified. 

 The veggie burger had no portebollo, the tiniest peice of tomatoes (the end) and wilted lettuce.  The chicken burger had no tomatoes,  wilted lettuce and doused in mayo.  And the fish although fish was cooked nicely, had no coleslaw and doused in mayo.  We asked for pickles on all three burgers and didn't see a thing on either.

This is my current favourite nail salon. I really think they do the best nails in the area! Also they try to make sure you're completely satisfied.

"I really do like everything about the Venetian- even their shows. We sat in ""P3"" which was the rear/front side orchestra & balcony. The venue is fairly small so I don't believe splurging for more expensive seats are necessary. 

To be honest, a friend watched this show in NYC. I wasn't particularly interested in seeing this show, but he went on and on and on and on and on .... about how great the show was. 

Now it's my turn to go on and on about how great this show was. If you enjoy a lil nostalgia, you'll love this. This show features a great sample of 80's music such as Harden my Heart, We Built this City, Sister Christian, Waiting for a Girl Like You, etc. Songs you can't help singing along to :) The cast had amazing voices also.

The musical was funny, well written, upbeat, and highly entertaining. It's well worth the money for this show. If you're looking for a show to watch in Vegas, don't miss this!!",5.0

Went to Discount down the street and Gabriel says yep pull right up and we will get them filled up. took 2 min, side note they had my fav radio station playing even turned mine off and on to make sure. he told me it was all good to and explained how the reader works for the tire pressure and the amount of years the sensors would last.

The staff was half way pleasant but the place was dead and we had a hard time getting chips and drinks.  Service was horribly slow.  Now the food... the Mexican Pizza was blackened around the egdes and probably the best thing we had.  Their tacos were so wet that when you went to pick one up they bottomed out.  The chicken was flavorless and the beef even worse.  It had a horrible after taste that made you hesitant to even continue eating it.  Good thing is they had their liquor license.  Bad thing was I didn't get a drink!  I would probably still be waiting for it anyhow.  This place was a HUGE disappointment.  It wasn't worth it even with the Groupon.

"I love CPK and almost always have a great experience. Their menu has expanded and hey offer a range of craft cocktails as well. 

Food: We ordered pepperoni pizza and chicken fettuccini. Both were good although the flavor of the fettuccini dish wasn't as light as it should have been.  Although it wasn't a cream sauce it came off as needlessly heavy. We wouldn't order that again. 

Service: Initially was good until I received a refill that was a Diet Coke instead of regular. Then it took about 10 minutes to get my pizza boxed. But the worst part of the experience was paying for the check. Within minutes of initially sitting down I informed my waiter I would be using Mobile Pay, CPK's new feature where you can create a tab via the app and pay for your meal right from the table. He acknowledged it, I gave him the code to link to my tab in-app, and I thought we were set. Once we were finished, paid, then exited, he comes running out accusing (not asking) me of not paying. I told him I used the app, and he says, 'no, you didn't.' At this point I'm getting angry because 1) don't tell me what I didn't do. He may not have seen or been privy (even though he should have been), but he cannot attest to what I did. 2) I showed him the receipt in the app and all of a sudden it comes to him. It was embarrassing and never should have occurred.",4.0
"I've been to Dolce many times over the years and always leave feeling beautiful. Today - another fabulous experience. I took one look in the mirror at myself today and knew I needed an emergency cut. I called Dolce's client coordinators and they squeezed me in pronto. My stylist, Paula, was everything I hoped for. She was friendly, efficient, and most of all - I look amazing. Love my cut, love the experience, love the service and products here. Great day.",5.0
"Happen to be on this side of town and was looking for a healthier sandwich place to take my dad to after leaving the hospital.  I found this restaurant on Yelp and we both found something delicious to eat.  Forget Subway and enjoy a handmade, fresh sandwich from The Sandwich Spot.  I had a Vegan (Vegetable) on wheat roll with their roasted pepper hummus.  DELISH!  I wish this place was on my side of town.",5.0
"On May 26th at about 1030AM 4 of us bought Sandwiches before boarding a flight to Seattle for an Alaskan Cruise. Since it was a 3 hour flight we thought we would eat the sandwiches on the plane. 
Couple #1 opened theirs before boarding and the sandwiches were totally soggy and bread slices with big holes in them. They returned them. Got a refund. Sandwich was disgusting!
Mine did not seem as bad but discovered the wet bread was from wet lettuce. I had a turkey sandwich fellow traveler had turkey cranberry. Landed in Seattle 2 1/2 hours later and I had FOOD POISENING. Extremely nauseous and actually slept for 16 hours and could not eat a thing. What a rotten start to a Cruise. This was a nightmare experience as I was sick for 2 days. I am still thinking of contacting an Attorney as your restaurant at Terminal 2 should be shut down.!!!!!",1.0
"Knew I had to go here after seeing the theme and giant blunt hanging from the wall. Next time I will get a blount size sandwich, but today just tried the 8 inch pinner. My order was for ""the Kind"", turkey/bacon/mushrooms and swiss. This was a great toasty sandwiich, best one I have in the toasted category. Lots of fresh toppings added as you yell out what you would like in the sandwich. Garlic herb Bread is clearly the way to go here. Of course of my first visit I had to try the snacks and ended up with a chocolate and vanilla rice krispy treat, which was unusual, sorta healthy and good for post session desert. This is my kind of place, it would have been back in college too. Some things never change. Alsom oipen til midnight.",5.0
"Nice job done on my refill for my gel nails...clean atmosphere, including the bathrooms..except, it was a bit too overpriced..I paid $45 for a refill and to shape them up (no other issues like any broken nails to fix)..I think that's a tad bit pricey for the service done. The lady who was doing my nails was doing a good job until her next appointment showed up, and then started rushing with me. The right side of my nails didn't look as shiny as compared to the left hand..so overall, I think it was a decent job, but pricey for a refill and a dull job towards the very end of the service. Other than that, my nails were on point..I liked the way the lady shaped my nails, as I requested the ""coffin shape"". Another good thing about this place is that they close late..11pm everyday if I'm not mistaken.",4.0
"I was excited to check this place out because of the reviews. As someone new, who hasn't been a customer before, or who is just getting a simple full set, I wasn't impressed with the customer service provided. I decided to get a full set of acrylics. The guy who did my nails kept cutting my skin with the nail file, and cut one of my finger nails way too short to the point where it started bleeding. I wanted a coffin shape, so they charged me an extra $5, but the shape was so deformed. The shape of my nails didn't match each other whatsoever. Would not go back.",1.0
These guys were sent out from my home warranty company. I'm always a little nervous when I don't get to pick contracts myself after research but I needn't have worried. They were very helpful and arrived at their scheduled time. I'm new to pool ownership so bombarded the tech with lots of questions which he patiently answered. They didn't have the valves with them to fix what was needed so we arranged another date for the repair and they handled everything with the home warranty company. There was another job i wanted done which wasn't covered by the warranty and they provided a very reasonable quote for that work which I accepted and was done at the same time. My booster pump was also not working which the warranty didn't cover. I asked about getting a new one but the tech recommended i get it repaired and told me of a place to go - that piece of advice saved me hundreds of dollars and Perry's Pumps is an awesome place too. I appreciate that kind of honesty when he could have easily sold me a new one and i would have been none the wiser. On repair day they were on time again and the work was completed swiftly and completely. This was at the beginning of the summer and now after several months use I can say there are no issues with the work - everything is working great. They will certainly be my first consideration for any future work or upgrades I need!,5.0

"I have been here at Luxe Scottsdale since January 2016.  I work out of the house so I am here all day and see most everything going on. There have been two previous management companies here.  Each had their issues.  Its a complex facility with many tech innovations and amenities.  Many apartments have Bluetooth wireless speakers and access to fiber optic Gigabit Internet  (1 gig download AND upload, for my geek friends).  The location cannot be beat, close enough to Old Town without dealing with the party crowd late at night.  Its a $3 Uber ride to Old Town.

While others have had complaints about the previous managers, the new team from Greystar are amazing.  Each and every one of them is going above and beyond to to make the residents happy. From simple things like cookies, a nice, clean coffee machine and doggie treats in the lobby.  Erick and Julia know my name and greet me warmly each time I enter the building.  I feel genuinely welcome every day. Dan, the property manager, is simply amazing.  He really cares about the residents and the property and that comes through in every interaction.

The new team is actively fixing the issues from the past, like slow package delivery, better parking concepts, like everyone getting assigned a spot, versus the previous companies policy of charging for a reserved spot.  They are really listening.  The maintenance crew led by Marcus is hard working and right sized for this property.  They are quick at resolving issues and keeping it clean.  The lobby is mopped everyday and the halls every week ... trust me there are a lot of halls to clean. The most important thing to me is that Luxe is a very pet friendly property, with doggie bags at every outdoor trash receptacle and a free, professional style dog wash station.  The residents are almost universally friendly and motivated in life.  Great energy here.

Couple of pet peeves. The lighting in the bathrooms is not optimal for showering, so I got a sheer curtain from Hookless which has a see-thru panel across the top.  Problem solved.  Some dog owners are not actively cleaning up after their animals.  Bad owners not bad dogs.  None the less maintenance keep the place spotless.

Since I work from the home i am pretty picky.  Its very quiet and the apartments are beautifully finished which makes for a productive environment. Overall, 5 stars because of Dan and his great team. I am delighted to live here.",5.0
"Incredible, fresh, creative food. Quiessence takes the farm-to-table concept seriously, and every dish we tried played up the flavors of its ingredients. We went with the tasting menu, and each course brought something unique. 

The place itself has a romantic and quiet atmosphere that is very relaxing, both indoors and outdoors. The service was friendly, personal, and efficient. Very nice wine selection, as well.

It is pricey, but well worth it. I would highly recommend for an occasion such as an anniversary.",5.0

Oh and noone's selling stuff I don't need like bootleg dvds or tamales- I'm serious this is what you expect at the other one. I used to take my mom to that other one and I hated going there.

"Worst place to book especially having a time share with them. This happen to us twice. Don't EVER book with them In the middle of June when there is EDC and IBS that week, they will give your room away to someone else! First time they did that we was sent to another place with roaches, recently for the second time they gave our room away to someone else when we noted ""late check in"" and same thing again. Customer service is the worst always acting like that can't do it or fix it. I don't recommend this place to anyone unless you like bad customer service and roaches. Will never stay there again learn our lesson the second time.",1.0
"This place doesn't really deserve 1 star but I needed to balance out the inflated scores other people are giving. It has been so incredibly hyped up that people who can't tell the difference between great food and average food will be compelled to give it 5 stars based on ambience and reputation alone.  
Yes, the atmosphere was farm-chic, but that also brings an air of snobby when you're close to Summerlin. That justifies them serving up extremely overpriced dishes that are average at best.
Don't get me wrong--I'm willing to spend the money for quality food. I've paid $1800 for a sushi meal for two before that I felt was worth every dollar, but the whole experience here left a sour taste in my mouth.",1.0

"First of all, this is not a traditional pizza. If you like a sweet sauce and crispy crust, this place is for you. They also use a crumbly sausage that is great. I have been getting this pizza for over 25 years and it is always consistent. 

You will either love it or hate it, nothing in between. Just remember, they have limited hours, no delivery, serve only pizza, take out only..... And they have still stayed in business for over 25 years. That has to say something about the pizza.

Unfortunately, they have really funny hours. That is the only reason I gave them four stars.",4.0

"If there's a better independent mystery bookstore than Poisoned Pen, please, please let me know! 

I discovered these guys many years ago in their old location, during a baseball Spring Training Arizona adventure. There were a lot of those and I'd guess this was about 2000-ish. Anyhow, I jumped on the mailing list and signed up for their excellent newsletter. 

Michael Connolly, my favorite LA mystery writer, is signing at the Poisoned Pen today, but I'm in LA. So sad....I saw all of the books stacked for him to sign and would guess he probably has carpal tunnel syndrome by now. 

Anyhow, I digress. The bookstore has a wonderful and knowledgeable staff who really know their authors. They carry  a wide variety of authors and the staff is really good at locating new authors.

The parking is limited but that is the only downside.

"Went to Fox & Hound on Friday night for Paint Nite, a canvas-painting class that travels to different locations around Charlotte. There was plenty of parking, so I had no trouble getting parked and inside. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a staff member who directed me to the area where Paint Nite was set up. This was great!

The restaurant itself is huge, but the bar area is pretty small. Once I got situated for Paint Nite, I went to the bar to order a drink and it was a solid 7 minutes before anyone was able to help up. The designated Paint Nite server approached us and took our drink order so we could take our seats and start painting. I appreciated that. But it was about 20 minutes until we got our drinks, and they actually lost my drink order so I had to reorder and wait another 10 minutes for my beverage. 

When I did get my strawberry watermelon margarita (that was only $6, BTW), it was delicious and refreshing and not too sweet (thumbs up). They were much more efficient with bringing our checks and closing our tabs. I did not try any of the food, but it looked and smelled really good.",3.0

"Money well spent!  That pretty much sums it up.  We just recently moved into a new house and I started painting my kids room but I just didn't have time to finish what I started plus it was hard because my kids were painting their names on the wall every time I turned around.  Since I had to get some drywall repaired because we replaced our stairs, I figured I would just hire a professional to do it all. 

The overall process was great from start to finish.  I got a call probably within an hour after leaving my info on their site to get a quote.  Adan came over the following day and provided us a quote.  After negotiating on the price, we were all set.  

Aldo came in on a Sat. around 7am and this guy was awesome!  He took about an hour just to cover the floors and tape the walls so from there I knew he was very meticulous with his work.  The owner also came by just to check up so I thought that was pretty cool.  Once the painting was done, his wife and friend came over and helped clean up floors and to remove tape, plastic and etc and they did a wonderful job.

Overall, we had a very wonderful experience.  My kids love their new room!  I know I wouldn't have done half the job Aldo did.  I definitely would recommend Fresh Coat and would use their services again in the future.",5.0

"I was very excited to try out this dumpling spot mainly due to the raving Yelp reviews, some have even claimed this place to have the best dumplings in town. To be honest, I wasn't impressed and the food was a total let down.

We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (steamed), Pork, Shrimp, and Melon (pan friend), and the beef spring onion wrap. 

The pan fried dumplings were not very good, it came out on a plate upside down and all stuck together, it really reminded me of how I make my own at home, but I would expect better from a dumpling house. The skin was thick and extremely starchy overpowering the filling which just resulted in a bland taste.

The beef green onion wrap came out cold and the green onion pancake was kinda stale.

The juicy pork dumplings were my true test as I have had this at many places around the world. And sad to say it too was a disappointment, these dumplings should have a very thin skin showcasing the delicacy of the hand work that went into it. Not only that but they are suppose to be juicy meaning there is some soup inside the dumpling. When it came out I can see that majority of the juices had leaked through the dumpling when it was being steamed, also a sign that the skin is not very good. The result were dry dumplings.

My apologies to all the fans out there but this place did not impress and it certainly didn't warrant a second visit. My tip if you want Juicy Pork Dumplings and Beef Wrap, Asian Legend is the best spot to get these items in the area. It has even been confirmed by my finicky better half who is Taiwanese.",2.0
"Had a great little dinner at this cute spot in Parkdale.

Ambiance/Decor: 
Really chill spot and looks like it's more suited towards a date spot or dinner with some friends, rather than a big group outing. We went there for a relatively early 6.30pm dinner on a Friday, so it wasn't too busy while we were there, and was just picking up as we left. They were playing the new Tame Impala record (at a reasonable volume, not unlike some other Parkdale restos I know!) so that was definitely a major bonus. Really nice decor all around and cool open kitchen concept. I loved the Chantecler sign and floor tiles too! 

Service: 
All around no complaints. The server was attentive, helpful and not pushy. 

Food:
The menu is small and focused on ""shareables"" so IMO best to come here with at least 1 other person, but not more than a group of 3 as some of the plates can be smallish (and because I'm selfish that way, haha). It's a fairly eclectic menu - popcorn shrimp definitely being the standout dish! It was a really good and tasty snack - the seasoning was on point. The beef tartare was very good - perhaps a tad too much wasabi as pointed out by other yelpers - but very tasty combo with the shrimp chips. The kale salad was just ok - a little uninspiring compared to some of the other offerings here, but maybe that's a good thing in the end. The hit was definitely the fish wraps. The haddock was perfectly battered and fried and the tartar sauce was oh so good. My gf had to order seconds. 

I would definitely go back but would try everything we missed next time around - so pork wraps, spicy wings, calamari and perhaps the lettuce meal - which sounds very tasty.

Cost: 
I don't always put this down on yelp, but our total was pretty easy to remember for this night ;) It was $100 on the nose with tip included. We had 3 fish wraps, beef tartare, kale salad, popcorn shrimp, 2 glasses of wine and a pint of the draft beer. Not too bad...

Overall, it's a great little spot if you are looking for a cozy, ""sexy"" vibe. Definitely a great date spot for the fellas if you are trying to impress your lady - but also a good spot to catch up with some close friends.",4.0
"Chandler apartments is an amazing place to live.  I've lived all over Vegas; sumerlin, Henderson and downtown.  Chandler is a quiet/young professional community.  There are very few little kids and ZERO disturbances.  It's central to a lot of great amenities.   Chandler screens all its tenants, so it's all professionals.  The office staff is on top of stuff like no other.  Most of the time the repair guy was at our place within one hour of calling.  

Ask for Francis, she is the office hottie ;).   The office staff bent head over heels to take care of us while we were there.  There were no hidden fees, no BS and the move out was so easy.  I've had nightmares in the past when moving out of an apartment.  The actually apartments are so nice and clean, all new/state of the art appliances.

"Tucked in the mythical spaceship complex in Ballantyne is Jade, on the second floor. It's not flashy, it's not modern, it's not fancy, it's just a nice sushi place. And the food certainly reflects the decor.

Overall, Jade is good, and I'd definitely recommend it for a more ""upscale"" sushi place. They have a good selection of sushi (some of it IS pretty unique, like the Dragon's Egg, which is a big rice ball with some sushi-like things in it), and the quality is pretty good as well. I've never had a problem with service either, but it's just missing that one special something to propel it to 5 stars. 

I will say that the outside seating is nice, and the string lights that hang down from the patio are a wonderful touch. I'd tell you what I recommend from their menu, but I can't access their website for some reason? Maybe someone should get on that....",4.0

"Back story, went on a paleo diet (caveman diet) about a month ago from this review in support for my wife who was having health problems. The day before we ate at a buffet and had the plethora of desserts, while the desserts were pleasing to the eye, they were not pleasing to our stomachs from all the processed sugar, so I sought out a bakery that would hopefully be more pleasing to our digestion. I found Beau Monde Bakery and my taste buds have never been more grateful. We had a pumpkin cake pop, a slice of carrot cake, and a chocolate brownie. All three were moist, we could taste all the flavors and none of them left a sugary aftertaste in our mouth, like our buffet experience.

"Although I'm extremely limited in what I can eat here, I'm totally obsessed with their fish filet hot pot. Unlike the normal Chinese fish filet I normally get, that's sautéed and smothered in black bean sauce--and not that there's anything wrong with that but--this delicious concoction smashes the standard Chinese options of fish filet. The dry pot comes mixed with red chilies, onions, and mushrooms. The peppercorn opens up your taste buds even more enhancing the flavors. It's Jesus opening the portals of heaven in my mouth, pretty much. A quick tip is to eat it before the crispy crunchiness goes away. After awhile the fish trends to get soft and it just isn't ask yummy.

Other dishes I've enjoyed was the mushroom dish that is cooked in pork fat. 
The spicy egg plant didn't disappoint either.",4.0
After spending 3 hours waiting at another urgent care.  They sent us to this one . Quick and easy.!!!

"Overall very pleased with the team at Diamond. I had a tight timeline that they were able to meet and the end result is flawless. We did have an issue on the initial install which turned out to be correctable. They did this within the same week and were very accommodating to ensure timelines were still met. Chris was a my sales rep and did a great job. He is a former installer and that was very helpful for my project as we were able to discuss specifics with respect to the install and seams. Having an educated sales rep is a great service to customers. The installers were very professional, worked to keep dust and debris to a minimum and communicated with me during the process.",5.0

"Beautiful restaurant, lovely service and delicious food. I came in for lunch; had their burger and fries. I couldn't get enough of this place. Everything is picturesque. This is the restaurant you see in a magazine and hope it's as good as it looks because you're traveling to Davidson. When you get there at your reservation time, you're thrilled you didn't let your cynicism stop you from making it. 

The burger: two patties, cheese, mayo. The fries: soft and fluffy insides with crispy outsides. I sat at the bar and talked to the bartender. What a pleasure. We talked about Texas and liquor stores around the states.  She told me all about the dinner menu and I can't wait to come back. A little bird let me know the patio opens soon!",5.0

"Is this a Dr. ,s office? Front desk was slow, unknowlageble, and just plain ignored you.  The nurse that took me back after a 35 minute wait acted like she would rather be anywhere but here, Dr. Julie Rake was the only pleasant experience in this circus of an office, and she sjhould really think about going elsewhere before her reputation is ruined by these other so called Dr. S. 
Just f. Y. I I have been coming here for well over 4 years when Dr. Robert Page would actually see you, he was good. But I guess so good he doesn't come in anymore, I tried everyone of his Dr. S since then, and I think there is 16 different ones that work there cuz I never see the same one and Dr Rake is the only one I recommended seeing. I have found a new Dr. Her name I's Claire Anthony and she resides at Dr . Fiels office on Baseline and McClintock. Excellent office excellent Dr. And there's only 2 Dr. S there, not a dozen.

He didn't appear to enjoy children or his job! Our pics turned out horrible!  We only ordered some because of the kids grandparents wanted some and we couldn't `fathom the stress of dressing the children and hauling the to another studio!

The service is hit or miss. I've had great service but more often than not it's lacking.

The homemade queso is EXCELLENT but my favorite is the loaded baked potato soup...I'm a big potato soup lover and their soup always hits the spot. 

The burgers are big and juicy and always cooked right. The fries are good too.

"I have been to Lucille's many times and it is one of my all time favorite restaurants. The complimentary biscuits with apple cinnamon butter are AMAZING!! 

I always order a full rack of baby back ribs and take the rest home. The leftovers make for a great treat later or the next day. This time I ordered the baby back ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and shoestring fries. Everything was delicious.

Lucille's also serves the best strawberry lemonade, which comes in an old school jar! The backporch strawberry lemonade is also really good (strawberry lemonade with vodka).

It was my friend's birthday so they have him a little sundae with a candle, which was kind of neat. Only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because service could have been better. Our waiter didn't seem too happy, or maybe he was just busy. Not bad service, but not great either.

We will be back.",4.0

Another horrible meal here. Your tri tip is chewey an so thin it tastes like deli lunch meat. Total crap. Second try here. It was no good  the first time either.

"I REALLY wanted to like Pancho's. We have always had a great experience at the Manhattan Beach location and loved going there. It has been several years since we have been back but at this location prices seemed a bit high even given the location. 

The first negative sign was when we nearly finished our chips and salsa before our order was even taken. The second negative was when I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and never received it. After our main entrees arrived I mentioned this to our server and he apologized and later gave an additional discount which was very nice. The last negative was food quality. Let's be honest, most Mexican sit downs seem to taste the same unless they have a signature stand out dish/item, or the style of cooking/preparation is different. Pancho's was no different. There was nothing about their food that justified the price point. 

Unfortunately,  we didn't even stay to use  the Yelp fried ice cream offer. We paid and left. However, I had the last laugh and ordered a second helping of the free chips and salsa...",2.0

Anyway, I liked him and he seemed to know his stuff...I  had real confidence that he could do a quality job and was looking forward to receiving an estimate., but I NEVER heard from him again!

"Let me start by saying how great this store is on customer service. I went there on Thursday evening after a long day at work to get a few things, one being the chicken they had in sale for 1.99lb. I asked the guy behind the counter who was cleaning up for the day if it was only on sale though the meat department and he said yes but I can get you some. I was amazed and thankful that he went above and beyond for me and got me what I needed, Jesus is a gem in your store.",5.0
"This place has the best pumpkin pecan pancakes on the planet! They are supposed to be a daily special, but they're so popular that they've kinda become a permanent daily special. No complaints about that! Try 'em. Your tummy will thank you! One minor gripe is that the combo ( pancakes served with two eggs and choice of meat) is kinda pricy at $14. I had it today with a cup of coffee and my bill was $18.01. Not exactly a cheap breakfast for one. 
The other breakfast dish that I love is The Cowboy, which are filet medallions, served with 3 eggs and toast. Steak and eggs for breakfast is one of my favorite things, and Perk Eatery does them perfectly!  At $16, they are a better value than the pumpkin pancake combo, but those pancakes...ahhhh.",5.0
"First impressions are very important when conducting business. When we arrived at Volvo Las Vegas, the SUV we were inquiring about was as clean as a button and parked up front with my name on it. The General Manager (Lane) took great care of us from the door.

The finance rep, Gary, was straight to the point about the additional options for our SUV and very personable throughout the process which we definitely appreciated.

But if you want Fleas in Cleveland, come to this massive Flea market, which I was dragged to by my thrifty friends in town and a girl from Buffalo that I thought I was bringing to Cleveland for things other than shopping.

I'd give it a 5 star rating for sure if it wasn't free. It takes place on the 2nd Saturday of every month in a massive industrial relic of the old days of Rust Belt Cleveland, and has a lot of everything you could imagine. I don't like that they charge you to get in, though.",4.0
"I don't think I had the normal experience here.  I walked in with a fellow yelper hearing about how awesome this place was and I wasn't disappointed, but not really sure what the deal is.

I stumbled in after a very long day just looking for that Bell's 2 hearted on draft, and I got one very quickly.  I then decided to walk to the bathroom to do what I needed to do, when I saw a guy videotaping an extremely wasted and out of place looking asian guy kinda peeing on himself.  I started to ask questions but eventually just walked away.  I went back a few minutes later to find a ""jugalette""(female ICP fan), guarding the men's bathroom for one of her friends.  This all seemed so out of place, but its what happened.

I was tired and not expecting much but I got a show whether I liked or not.  Don't expect the same as this place probably does not see this crowd often.

"We've been in Waxhaw for 11 years and have tried EVERY Chinese restaurant in the area. We FINALLY have a favorite! We ordered several dishes to share and we loved everything. The ingredients were all very fresh, the servings were generous, and the service was very friendly. 

My only minor complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the fried rice....it was dry and bland. It was fine with other items mixed in, but (in my opinion) fried rice should be able to stand on it's own. I do wonder if the rice is different if it's ordered by itself than when it comes as the complimentary side with an entree. Our rice was the complimentary side, so I will give it another try by placing an order for fried rice next time.",4.0

"I am so pleased with the results of the work provided be Baker's Travertine Power Cleaning!   The floors look sooooo much better than they did before!

We bought our 15 year old house a couple of years ago, and I've hated the travertine since the day we moved in.  Right away we had it professionally cleaned, updated and sealed the grouted.  But it still looked dirty and icky.

So finally when I accepted that I couldn't afford to rip it up and replace it, I searched for options to make the floor at least look clean.  I found Baker's on YELP, was impressed by their reviews, and gave them a call.

Tom came out right away and explained their process to me.  He showed me the finishes I could choose, and I decided on the high polish.  I love it.

Travis and Cody showed up right on time on Aug. 19.  They were very professional, worked quickly - but thoroughly - and had the job done in about 6 hours.  That seems pretty fast for 677 sq ft.

I highly recommend Baker's Travertine Power Cleaning.  Their professionalism is high, their prices are reasonable, and the results are excellent.",5.0
"I went back. We were hoping to get their Restaurant Week menu but they only offer it at dinner. But we were all starving so we stayed and ordered. We sat at the huge shared table I mentioned in my original review that they used as a business table. The Cardinals game was about to come on and we wanted a view of the TVs that I  also mentioned in my previous review that showed a vile news program. They didn't turn the game on at the start but finished the KC/Wash game and we missed a Cards field goal. (Bitter)

The service was GREAT today. I should have gotten our server's name, she was timely, informative and super friendly. Long blonde hair and knew triathlons. 

About the food - first negative - no kid's menu and the prices are so high. 

My older boy got the chicken and waffles, this is no LoLo's but the kid really liked it. Small piece of what appeared boneless chicken, lots of waffles with BACON crumbled on top, and a big pile of scrambled eggs (totally unnecessary for the kid) $13

The younger boy couldn't find anything he wanted so we got him the BBQ sliders with the caramelized onions and aioli on the side with fries. $10 He wasn't impressed.

The husband got the short rib sandwich. Huge, spilling over with meat and caramelized onions, the bread looked rustic but soft with onion rings - he loved it. Enjoyed with Sessions lager. $11.75

I got the smoked turkey, thick bacon, thick tomato slices, sprouts and pesto aioli on a croissant. Huge sandwich I could only eat half and was very full. You really can't screw up this sandwich and it wasn't a risky order - I just needed something good after a long run morning. I also got the sweet potato fries, perfect with small but visible bits of salt. Enjoyed with a hoppy beer from Boulder Brewing $10.75

It was a much better experience then the first time. They serve you a ton of food we have three boxes in our fridge right now and the prices reflect that. The total was $67 for four lunch/breakfast meals, two sodas, three beers. Now that I typed it out, thought about the quality of food and beer, it is fine. It was a good meal except I missed the start of the game. Boo.",4.0
"Terrible. You'd think that being Paris & having the infamous Eiffel Tower drink would be worth it but screw that! Friends & I only came here because Fat Tuesday was closed at Caesar's & we wanted to get a fast drunk without walking all the way to PH--which we should've done anyway because this crap was disgusting.

Wanted a margarita-strawberry daiquiri mix with a few extra shots, the homie at the bar said they were dry of margaritas. So instead, he proceeds to put SHOTS of tequila at the bottom of the tower & fill the rest with daiquiri. Wouldn't be a problem if the straw didn't take from the bottom first, or melt directly into the tequila later. Because finishing that tower was a mission that didn't feel good at all.

Don't stop by unless you want the tower--sans the drink. Move on & get an OG Fat Tuesday because this will literally make you feel like a toilet.",1.0

"I was actually eager to see this musical, 50 Shades! The Smash Hit Parody, because I have only read the first book and afterward had no desire to read the remaining books nor see the movie.  This parody is based off the first book.  I was not a fan of the book so I was eager to see someone make fun of it.  

I walked in certain that nothing was going to make me laugh but I was wrong; every time I looked at the actor that played Christan Grey I couldn't contain myself.  He was the sloppiest looking actor ever, a complete opposite of the handsome Christian Grey that I read about.  

If you have a crude sense of humor, it's hard to sit through all 69 minutes and not find this parody hilarious.  

For instance, I was seated next to a couple and the gentleman had never read the book, but he was laughing so hard sometimes I think I was laughing more at him than the actual play.  It's refreshing to know that one doesn't have to have read the book or seen the movie to find the parody enjoyable.

"stayed here on my bday earlier in the year...the one star is for the fact that the hotel is really pretty & our room was huge.  
BUT I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!  we got the room on hotwire so i cant complain about the original price.... but then when we got there we were informed that they only have valet parking that you have to pay for.  so there's another 50$ for 2 nights.  EVERY other hotel in Vegas has free self parking....this place is in the middle of nothing ---they could make a parking lot!  
then they also charge a resort fee of like 30$ per day....  i wouldn't consider this place a ""resort""  
the staff at the hotel were snobby
They have only one extremely expensive restaurant to choose from .  

But the BEST part was when my boyfriend and I ordered room service in the middle of night.  We noticed that the menu stated that gratuity was added to the bill, no problem!  When the woman arrived to deliver the food, she handed me the bill to sign and i left the tip line blank and mentioned to her that it was bc the tip is already on the bill.... she then said that she doesn't get any of that tip and usually people tip her too.  SO YOU WANT ME TO PAY YOU 2 TIPS?  AKA 40% of the ridiculously expensive cobb salad etc.  Then she stayed around for a while talking about how the they don't let her have the tips & how she is a single mother struggling to make ends meet....... IS THIS SOME SORT OF SICK JOKE is what I was thinking.  I'm sorry but this was my birthday and not her pity party!  Not to sound rude but it was definitely weird!

"The good: the peanut butter chocolate cookie is amazing. Crunchy and thick outer circle with a soft and almost underbaked center. Can't wait to try the muffins.

Because I was running late for a meeting I didn't have time to ask them to remake it and had to slowly pick out all of the cheese.

"I have been going to Romancing the Bean for about 15 years now, back when they were at the Pavilions and have followed them to this new location.  I live off of the 101 and 7th Ave and I make the drive out there because they have the best coffee and freshest baked goods in town.  I especially love the cream cheese muffins!  
The first thing that hits you as you enter is the smell!  Breathing in the tantalizing aroma of baked foods and tantalizing coffee, how could anyone resist the temptation to buy a coffee and a treat?  I know I can't!
The price of coffee drinks and food are very reasonable.  They have homemade muffins, cookies, croissants, and soups that are fresh each morning; you don't find that in to many coffee shops.  
In most coffee shops you find bagels, muffins, and pre-made salads that are delivered from somewhere else and that stay on the shelves for a couple of days. 
Which would you rather have? Me, I'd rather pay a little more for great coffee and fresh food than go to shops with prepackaged items and inferior coffee.
Romancing the Bean also has wonderful people working there. They provide a friendly atmosphere all the time.  It is a family owned business and that is what it feels like when you walk in the door.  Romancing the Bean is a truly delightful place to visit.",5.0

"I would give this a negative star if I could. 

This place is awful for their service! Totally inconsistent depending on who you get. It's like their requirements to work here are to be snobby and rude and if you're lucky, occasionally friendly. 

I still remember buying clothes online and trying to return them. They gave me the option to do this for the sizes. I go in the store to return these, but they give you so much attitude. Unlike most stores, their return policy is ridiculous (10-14 days). They are only happy if you purchase something and NEVER when you're returning anything. There was only one cash opened when there was a long line up and 5 girls on floor that were free. When it's my turn to return these, the girl tells me that this shouldn't have happened because they are super busy to do this kind of transaction. Well then, hire more staff and open the other cash! I don't understand how Aritzia, with multiple stores, plentiful customers selling at high prices cannot afford to do this. After she processes it, she makes a mistake, and doesn't acknowledge that she missed refunding an item. She tells me to wait in line again to correct her mistake when she should have done it right away. I wait another 10 minutes in line just so she can finish with the customers. At this point, I'm furious and asked to speak to the manager. She tells me she is the manager and gives me this rude glare and attitude. I cannot believe how incompetent the staff here are and Aritizia is.

I finally got to check out this awesome spot in the Vegas arts district (for lack of a better description). Turns out it's right next to Hop Nuts Brewing--another relatively new business I've been meaning to try.

I wasn't sure if lavender anything would be good, but I gave the latte a try. It was fantastic! I'm definitely going to try making my own lavender simple syrup for homemade lavender lattes. If they are half as good, I'll be happy.

I also suddenly got hungry and ordered their Arepa Benny. One of the points of getting Eggs Benedict to me is for the Hollandaise. In this case, the mother sauce is replaced with Chimichurri and the English muffins are replaced with arepas. Eggs were perfectly poached. Bloody brilliant!

Favourites included the spider roll as well as the salmon sashimi. 

The location is pretty central to Markham/Scarborough at the intersection of Steeles and Kennedy. Parking may be a bit tough since it's in a rather small parking lot. 

Definitely my go-to place when I'm craving sushi.",4.0
"No waiting for the ER on Monday morning. I was seen immediately. Dr.Kim was able to get me admitted to the wound care center right away. My ER nurse Tiffany was amazing-great personality and truly cared. My primary physician Dr.Tanveer, is the sweetest doctor I ever had. She was going above and beyond - even personally called my case worker and insurance t make sure the rushed my discharge.Dr.Alexie (infection and disease doctor) was superb. He made sure I had the right antibiotics for my body . he was very thorough. His orders caught the infection from spreading to my bone. My surgeon Dr.Licup was fast and efficient (something you definitely want when someone is cutting you open!). My physical therapist JD and his student were so funny and answered all my questions.  I had such a great team! I absolutely recommend summerlin hospital.",5.0

"First of all, I am a loyal Avis customer. I come to Cleveland every year to see my mother. Every year I rent from Avis at CLE and every year, they find some way to make it less than good. The Cleveland rental car center is already a challenge- probably the worst in the US (I fly a lot), but Avis always finds ways to annoy. Counter people sent me to my preferred space to find a car that had no keys and was locked. Went back to counter and had to wait for them to get another car for me. The whole point of preferred is that I don't have to go to any counters.. On return, it was pouring rain. 5:30am. Sign pointed me to an area I hope was the return. No attendant, no covered area remaining. Got soaked, had to walk to counter to get a receipt.. And this is just like other times- same problem. No outside attendant. No direction given.. All on me to figure it out and walk around when all I want to do is get to the plane and go to sleep. Next time, I'm going Hertz or National in Cleveland.",1.0
"Decided to try this new sushi place in town after seeing few 4.5 star reviews on Yelp. There were only 3 tables occupied when we walked in but since this place has only been opened for roughly a month, I decided to try it out anyway. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. After being a sushi-lover for years, I usually rank a restaurant's fish freshness by ordering salmon nigiri's; the texture of the salmon sushi was rough, it tasted like it was refrigerated for a while, and the color was just off. The rest of the sushi nigiri were okay but they all tasted like they have been refrigerated for a while. 

However, I do have to give them props for their cooked appetizers --- they tasted really delicious. Service was okay --- had to get the waitress' attention to refill our cups every single time but she was polite; probably just inexperienced in waiting tables. 

Overall, I don't think I will be returning to this place. There are a lot more sushi places in town that offers fresh sushi. Even though their cooked appetizers are a lot tastier than the place I frequent, it is not strong enough of a reason to return just for that purpose.",2.0

"The Good:  a clean, careful, professional car wash with decent hours and a good lounge with free bottled water.  The owner and staff are reasonably friendly, as well.

The Bad:  on both of my visits here, I've had to wait over 2 hours for a basic car wash.  Also, the price is alright, but not great.  Time, however, can be even more important than money, and it's sometimes difficult to justify the amount to time you have to put in here.

The Ugly:  a $5 surcharge for ""bug removal"" from the front bumper!  This is the only car wash out of the dozens I've been to that charges extra for what is usually just considered part of the normal wash.",3.0

We got our passes on the Strip, no line, no cover, no problem!!  I love guest lists.  

We didn't stay as long as I would have liked because the bride and the other girls were pooped from the previous night's debauchery.  Wimps.  I'm definitely checking Jet out again the next time I'm in Vegas.  And best believe, it will be soon!!",4.0

I had a pepperoni pizza and it was just plain flavorless. The pepperoni and sauce was the delicious flavor of a good old water. Yum! (not).

"I received excellent service when I stopped in to purchase some shoes.  They had just what I wanted, the Dry Joys Tour in the classic brown saddle.

"I haven't been to the actual store, but I stopped by their stand at Bloomfield Little Italy Days last night.  My lab manager claimed that they have the best cannoli there, and they had a prominently displayed sign that claimed likewise.

The cannoli ran $4 each, and could be filled with ricotta, chocolate ricotta, or both.  I opted for a combination, since ricotta is my standard for comparison, but I wanted to try the chocolate ricotta, too.  (I preferred the chocolate filling slightly.)  The ends came dipped in chopped nuts, which I wasn't particularly thrilled about, since I prefer my deserts without nuts, but they did add some interesting texture.

Overall, the cannoli was pretty good, but I preferred the one I had last year from a different stand, which I recall being slightly larger and less expensive, and being dipped in chocolate chips on the ends, which I prefer to nuts.  So, I'm afraid I must disagree with the claim that this is the best cannoli in PGH--or at Little Italy Days.

If I get out to Monroeville, I'll have to stop by to try their other pastries.  If I do, I'll update this review accordingly.  3.5 stars.

EDIT: They charge over $1 more for cannoli at Little Italy Days than they normally do at the bakery.  While I get that their stand is very popular, considering that the best cannoli of my life at Termini Bros. cost $4, I don't think it's worth the inflated price.",3.0
"We had a lovely time at Oro. The service was excellent and the food was amazing! We had antipasto at first, then I had pasta of the day and my boyfriend had the veal meatballs.

"Bought a Groupon for a synthetic oil change and randomly came in one day after work. They were extremely busy but the guy was really nice about it and asked if I could come back in 2 hours . Totally fine because I understand they were busy. No big deal.  I came back, they took me right away. Changed my oil and was out within 30 minutes. There was snacks, soda/water and even some Netflix to keep busy. The gentleman was extremely nice (wish I remembered his name, he had tattoos and a beard) and even mentioned my front tires were going bald. With no pressure at all or trying to sell me something, he just gave me an estimate of how much it would be to replace them and suggested I replace them soon. I'm glad he mentioned it because I had no idea! Would definitely recommend this Midas. Just go with some time because they might be busy!

Fantastic service! The waiters are attentive, prompt and friendly. Also, they make sure your bread and water is always stocked. The owner will stop in once in a while, and if he is in then will check on you. Really nice, and not much more you can ask for!

As for food + beverages - 

Insanely priced beverages for a restaurant. A bottle of good wine. $15. Yes. A bottle. Not a glass.

And pizza - oh my god. Perfectly crispy crust. Not over done or underdone interior on the dough. Not too doughy or too thin - perfect classic. And just dripping with goodness and the best sauce ever! :D

Also, you can draw on the paper table cover with crayons - me and my friend had an intense game of hangman and connect 4 while we got out pizza! :D",5.0

"All hail Cesar (in the Service Department)!!  I would like to sincerely thank my Service Writer, Cesar!  He provided exceptional service from the time I dropped my vehicle off and followed up with me a few days later to make sure everything was going well with my vehicle. When I dropped my vehicle off, he asked questions about the performance of my vehicle and what my specific needs were.  He was honest about the service time and provided a rental car for the inconvenience and kept me up to date with the status of my vehicle.  It may sound corny, but he made me feel as if I was ""important."" Additionally, he helped me from incurring late registration fees by recommending that I go to the DMV and get a moving permit due to the vehicle registration about to expire. I was not aware that you could get or would need to do this until he brought it up.  I would give Cesar 10 stars across the board. I really appreciate the service he provided, his genuineness, and his honesty.  I will always ask for Cesar.  Great Service Department!!  Thanks Cesar!",5.0

Neither of us had ever been to a Korean BBQ, but to our delight the owner was so gracious, sweet and put us completely at ease within 5 minutes.  She showed us all the meat and explained what we were to do.  The other patrons of the restaurant were also very concerned that we had a good experience.  Several times people would ask us if they could help us and offered to show me which foods were hot and spicy.

Never in our lives have we been in a place that cared so much in giving us an enjoyable experience.  And, was it good?  You better believe it!  Don't ask me what I ate, but it was definitely good and we will definitely be going back.",5.0

"If you own a car you actually care about then DO NOT get your tint done here. 

I took my C6 Z06 here what a mistake. I was quoted $139.00 on the phone in person it the price went up to $169.00. At this point I should have walked, but the review here was good so I stayed. Honestly I was not looking for a cheap tint job and would have paid double to have it done right. 

Once finished I found scraches on the driver side window. Bubbles in the rear window. 

I went back and the only person there was the ex-con installer Victor who's basic reaction was tough luck and wanted to charge me to remove the tint.

"I'm going to rate this experience solely on service.  I was with my wife and daughter and decided to stop in for some refreshments on a hot summer day.  Upon arriving here the first thing I noticed was how angry all of the staff looked.  No one was helpful at all, and trying to get some help was near impossible.   We decided to simply order two iced teas to go.  The gentlemen that served us was obviously tired and in a bad mood (maybe because it was near the end of the day and he just wanted to go home), but trying to get him to help us was near impossible   we finally got our two iced teas, which tasted like lightly flavored warm water and left - never to return again.

"It's been five months since I purchased a 2015 Azera from Shane Motors, and I couldn't be happier. Like others, I was a little wary, as this was my first experience buying from a broker. Now I can't imagine going anywhere else. Shane was personable and straightforward, with zero pressure. He gave a fair price for the car, and for my trade in. And the Azera is flawless. Beyond this, when I had an issue with ADOT, he returned my call within hours (even though he was on vacation), and had tracked down the answer in the same day. (When I had a similar issue at another dealership, they acted like the didn't know me.) I've already referred several friends to Shane. I own a small business, and I like dealing with people who also have a passion for what they do. You can tell that he actually cares about selling quality cars and his customers.",5.0

The servers were so friendly and sweet, and the door guys were even super nice and accommodating on both occasions. Our server from the Thursday even recognized me on the Saturday and stopped to say hello, despite us not being in her section! Food is good, drinks were good, music was totally awesome.

"This was THE SHITTIEST first-dosa-tasting of my life. I know it's impossible to rate my first-tasting of anything, but I'm pretty sure when you get a sour stomach and horrible shits after being at a restaurant - it was a horrible first experience. 

I really hope dosas don't actually taste like what they did here. The food item itself can't be that horrible or else no one would eat it, right? But you see, I'm traumatized to a point where I might not even consider re-evaluating what they taste like and just leave it at that. 

The service was shoddy. The drink prices (non-alcoholic) are shitty for the amount you get, which is close to nothing. The venue looks like a McDonald's in an airport food court. If this is what they think south India should be, then I recommend that Britain reoccupy. 

The only thing I'd recommend is the Madras coffee, to-go. That's the one thing they didn't manage to screw up royally.

"NAYSAYERS GTFO!!!


It's the second time I did business with these kind folks and it was always a pleasure doing business with them... 

I have a bit of auto-tech background in me. I went to school for it and I do all of my vehicle maintenance, but getting a smog check on both of my vehicles is not an option. I don't have the equipment to perform these tasks, so I have to go to these guys to get them done. They perform smog checks for $10 out the door! That's 50% cheaper than any other smog check places, plus I get a FREE vehicle inspection!!! 

Although it was a challenge looking for their shop the first time around because it was placed in the back of the lot, I managed to find it.  As soon as I step in their clean lobby I was greeted with their friendly staff right away with a smile. Their office is a little bit dated, but they do have a leather reclining chairs, not brand new, but comfortable and there's a big screen TV. It may not be the ""STEALERSHIP"" I mean ""DEALERSHIP"" ambiance, but it does have that ""LOCAL SHOP"" atmosphere that I like. There's also stores and a place to eat near the area to get something to eat or walk around while your car is getting work done...

They are located about 15 mins away from my house, and even if there's a smog check place 5 mins away from my house, I rather drive the extra mile (NPI) to get these folks to work on my car. Wait is not too bad since the last time I went, it took them 45 mins and the second time took 1 hr 27 mins from the time the service manager grabbed my keys to the time they handed it back to me...

Bottom line is, they are really friendly, their price is great! I mean have you been to a dealership for a quote? lol not just for smog check but for repairs... the place is convenient for me and the wait time is waaaaay below average compare to other shops. I never felt that they forced me to do repairs on my car, but they always suggested maintenance that needed to be done in the near future... I will continue to do business with them for as long as I live here in Las Vegas...",5.0

The sausage is excellent here and the French toast I had was bigger than what you might get at a different restaurant, I love the thicker style.  Now the layout of the restaurant seems small so if you expect to get seated right away with anything more than 6 people in your party then good luck.  Overall I had a great experience and leftovers afterwards!",5.0
"A nice annual arts, music, and food festival in June which runs over 2 weekends and during the week between for free admission.  It is especially nice when it's a sunny day to enjoy festivities (this appears to be a quite rainy time of our year).

Food:  Run-of-the-mill food booths with usual outdoor fare.  TIP:  Do NOT get the haluska in the Polish food line.  I love this dish with noodles and cabbage but this was not anything representative of the dish.  It was basically egg noodles and a tiny few bits of cabbage swimming in oil.  Yech.  I do wish I had tried the lobster burgers (note:  they were off to the side and not in the general food booth area of Point State Park).  TIP:  Take your food and head to the Point State Fountain area for some shade because the picnic tables and food booths are totally devoid of any shade on a sunny day.  TIP:  We did find a food truck with bottled watter and soda for $1.00 each.  I thought that was extremely reasonable.

Music:  Many varieties, multiple stages for free.

Art: Surprisingly good selections and some very distinct high-end quality art from jewelry, pottery, wood bowls/vases, to paintings.  Not limited to local artists.   

Parking:  Might I suggest you park in the 1st Ave garage (right off 2nd ave exit on I-376) for a flat rate of $5 on weekends and take the ""T"" transit for free to the Gateway station.  You'll be right where you want to be and avoid congestion trying to park anywhere else.

Restrooms:  Porta-potties were gross shortly after noon on Saturday, the 2nd day of this event.  Seriously gross, more gross than gross of any other event I've ever been to or any selection of portable restrooms I've ever witnessed.  Ever.  Might I suggest the static restrooms near the Point fountain, the restrooms at the 1st Ave garage when you arrive or leave, or dining at Market Square nearby and then using their restrooms?",5.0

Our waiter never checked on us- took forever to find someone that could get me another drink. We felt ignored. When it was time for the check, we found out that the machine was broke so we knew we would be waiting even longer. Much to our surprise, our waiter comes to our table, apologizes, and tells us to have a good night (our entire meal was on the house!) so overall, it was worth it!

My haircut was not worth that much! That's the priciest hair cut I have ever gotten and I was only there for 1 hour or less. So I just paid my dues and left a tip, but probably will not be coming back knowing that it's so expensive!",2.0

"Very nice interior which lends itself to a very comfortable dining experience.  Little hesitation at hostess stand while she ended her conversation without even acknowledging our presence but once she hung up, we were seated near window overlooking patio.  I know the restaurant has no control over the plaza and the people that gather there but we watched 20 to 25 runners (?) warm up, stretch, swig water and spit all within our view point.  Was not able to see this until they raised blinds.  Staff might want to wait until runners have left area directly within eyesight before raising blinds.  Ribeye was totally different - chef removes outer fat rim and you are left with what looks like a filet Mignon but once you cut into steak you quickly realize it is not a filet.  Not sure if it was just this piece or this is normal (again have never seen a trimmed ribeye like this) but it was not as tender as a normal cut ribeye.  Flavor was good - blackening spices not over done.  Onion soup is heavenly but you can easily remove the first layer of skin on the roof of your mouth if not careful.  Wines by glass were a very nice selection - still can not fathom why reds are served at ""room temperature""  which is close to 70 or 72 - they should be cooler.  Spinach salad was adequate - bacon bits were akin to gravel but once pushed out of the way, salad was lightly dressed which is a big plus, not the usual drenching of the greens.  Waiter talked us into dessert because ""Mom"" made it and he was so right.  Best carrot cake ever.  Will be back soon.",4.0

"PRE-APPOINTMENT:
Koreatown's Maya is my usual place, but I didn't feel like putting up with their menopausal receptionist lady today, so I decided to try somewhere new. I emailed Kamiya on Sunday to book an appointment for Tuesday, and got a confirmation on the same Sunday. I also wanted an upper lip wax, but they relayed to me in the email reply that the waxing lady had taken the day off. Also in my original appointment email, I didn't specify on whether or not I wanted a female or male stylist, so when I told them I wanted a female stylist when I arrived, the receptionist guy / hair washer guy got a little upset. Oops. So it's probably a good idea to specify in your email what you want, heh.

ON-LOCATION:
The place isn't too difficult to find actually. There's a store sign right above the sidewalk that directs you inside. The place is nicely air conditioned, so there's no nasty hairspray/salon smell when you go in - thank goodness! I was greeted by the receptionist, suggested me to take a seat with me and my friend, and then after a couple of minutes waiting, I was asked to go over to the hair washing area. My biggest complaint during this time was that despite they had taken my jacket and all, they did not offer me a salon robe to wear. Their customers do not get a salon robe at all, so if you have really long hair, and the hair washer doesn't wrap your hair properly after the wash, the back of your shirt gets wet, which is annoying. Also, I didn't get the supposed 10-minute scalp massage (even though I was on-time for my appointment!)... Which was disappointing because I was looking forward to it :(

HAIR CUTTING:
The receptionist guy / hair washer told me my hair was really soft, and the actual female hairstylist - her name is Mai - said my hair was slightly damaged at the back, that it was really dry there. I had planned to get 2.5 inches trimmed off but since she emphasized a lot that it was very dry at the back, I went and got about 3.5 inches off. (YOLO!) Afterwards, she told me that my hair looked /a lot/ healthier now after I got the dry section trimmed off, lolol. Anyway, Mai was great. I haven't gotten a haircut in over a year, so I asked a crapload of questions about digital perms (she advised me not to; my hair is too soft/light/straight for it, so it'll get easily damaged); how often I should get a haircut to keep it healthy (every three months because I wear my hair long); straightening vs. curling irons etc. Overall, she was very friendly and very helpful! I think she was kinda sick (slight coughing/sneezing) while she took care of me, but I'm pretty sure it's an one-off occurrence and I personally wasn't too bothered by it (YOLO + my excellent immune system). Anyhow, I grabbed her business card before I left and took lots of selfies afterwards. So yay :)

Moscow mule served proper, in a tin cup to keep it freezing cold.

"Terrible. I will never go back.

My appointment was at 3:30, I arrived on time. I wasn't actually called back until 4:15? Why actually set an appointment if they aren't even going to call you on time?

My stylist was unprofessional, and quite frankly obnoxious.I just wanted everything to be over with. She smelled horribly of smoke after each break she took every 20 minutes. 

My color turned out the worst. I asked for strawberry blonde highlights. What did I get? Dark red, copper-ish, CHUNKY highlights, that faded into an awful pink color. 

I had to spend over $100 to get my hair professionally fixed. I even disputed the charge with the salon. I refuse to pay $50 to have my hair royally screwed up.",1.0
"Went for a Happy Hour with coworkers from out of town, but even with ""happy hour"" pricing, 4 of us still made out of there with an over $330 bar tab which we feel was not right at all. We had $25 worth of food (which was really really good) but don't see how the bill could possibly be so much and we carefully reviewed each item and still could not see how the tab was that much - especially when we were there for ""happy hour"" prices on several of our drinks. Our waiter though nice and chatty seemed shady as he made seversl ""mistskes"" but allegedly didn't charge us for wrong or incomplete items he brought us, so even with that, there is just no way we could have had such a high bill. The issue was so shady/disputable that the manager even discounted our tab by $40.
We left feeling scammed/targeted for being from out of town. My advice is if you go there, have the wings and pierogis but don't settle in for drinks.",1.0

The room was a little on the small side for what we were expecting but it was very interesting decor (see photo posted of bed/headboard).

"I will admit. I've never come here for anything but chicken wings and beer.
That said, from Sunday through Tuesday they have half price wings which make this place a great place to go to. 

Admittedly, the inside is very much like a local sports bar watering hole. Not much to talk about aside from the tvs visible from most areas, but clean enough to not be worried about touching the tables. The patio is prime though, slotted along Bathurst Street just south of King. The only challenge is getting a table when the weather is nice.

The chicken wings are really good though. A good size with just the right amount of sauce. Pretty sure we destroyed around 40 wings and 3 beers for under $50 when all said and done on the last half price wing night we were there for. Approved!",4.0

I just moved in from California and my cousin wanted to show me around. She told me about Grouchy Johns and how it all started as a food truck.
*not many drink food trucks around turning into stores so this was interesting.

Walked in and was definitely noticed by the workers and was greeted as i came up to the register. The pretty lady informed me about all the new deals coming up and the top 5 most popular drinks.

I was in a dilemma so she kindly and patiently helped me out.

I ended up pursuing the Nutella Blended.
It tastes heavenly. Just like diabetes. 

Kind guy who made my drink brought it out and walked it to me.

Probably the worst customer experience for any Sandwich shop, especially on that cost over $22 for 2 subs, chips and drinks.

When subs were delivered (with incorrect chips) the turkey avocado was delicious but had to wander around for 10 minutes with other customers (also upset at cashier) in search of napkins that were evidently stored in the vault. Eventually flagged down a disgruntled employee and they were able to bring some napkins which we passed out to 2 other unlucky patrons.

"As far as Hiltons go, this one is on the lower end. 

The lobby itself is very nice and probably has been remodeled recently. Very good looking place when you walk in. 

They have a small restaurant, a full bar and a gym and laundry room. Small pool and jacuzzi out front. Yea, front.. kinda weird location for it but oh well. 

The rooms are kinda ""older"" looking. Nothing in there is terrible, just not what you'd expect from a Hilton. 

Shower was ehhh... water pressure and temp are kinda lacking. 

I booked using my hotels.com account. The price was actually very low. So I'm reality, it was very much worth what I paid for it ... still, I stay in Hiltons a lot... and this was an older, lower tier Hilton for sure. However, there's nothing ""wrong"" with it.

"Ahhhh, I love massages! Massage heights did not disappoint. They have a $39.99 introductory rate that includes free aroma therapy, they also have what looks like a good membership package. They did try to sell me on this but it was an easy no for me since I have a membership else where. Take note, if you sign up the day of your introductory massage they waive the $40 enrollment fee. To this I say, while the membership is appealing overall - an enrollment fee? You've got to be kidding me.

It has a quiet relaxing waiting room and very comfortable massage tables. Rich was my masseuse and he gave me a wonderful deep tissue massage. He was very professional and promoted a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. I'll go back if I see that they're running specials and, if not for the enrollment fee, I would strongly consider changing my membership to be here.",4.0
"I have been wanting to go here for yearsssssssssss.  Typically when a restaurant has that much hype, you would expect to pay a ton of money to eat there, but I knew the pizza here is not crazy expensive, so I have no idea what held me back for so long. 

So finally, on my b-day weekend, my girlfriend Abby treated me to Pizzeria Bianco, a place she been wanting to try out for a while as well. 

As I'm sure many of the reviews probably already note, this place is now open for lunch. We went about 1:30 pm on a Friday and were able to grab a seat right away at the bar. The place stayed busy the whole time, even when we left at 3:00 pm, but you wouldn't have to wait more than a couple minutes for a table. 

I started out with one of their draft beers, not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one. I loved the coziness of the place, and completely understand why there would be such a long wait in the evenings. 

I had the Wiseguy pizza and Abby had the Sonny Boy. Over all pretty good. I think we were both expecting to have some light shine down on us from heaven and the bartender bust out some harps as we took our first bite. The pizza was good, and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder. I actually like La Bocca Urban Pizzeria better. Hope that don't break any of your hearts hearing that.

Everyone should go at least one time. I wouldn't mind coming back again as well, I wish I could go before Suns games. I could probably add my name to the list before the game and get seated after! 

Protip: If you just want to try this place out, go for lunch. If you have time (and money) to burn, it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours, then eat some tasty fresh pizza.",4.0

"I was thrilled to learn that a Komex had opened up a bit closer to my workplace. Love their food especially the fusion beef bulgogi and pork belly tacos. The Buffalo location is bigger even if the layout is a bit odd. A bar which looks like it will never be used, takes up a large portion of the room. 
This Komex isn't as hectic as the other smaller location at lunch time. However, during my first visit here with coworkers, someone apparently placed a large takeout order which resulted in waiting for our food for nearly 45 minutes. Even made to order food shouldn't take this long. They need to have enough staff to cook these call-in orders in order to not affect restaurant service. We were patient though and their food was delicious. 

I tried them again on a Saturday at lunchtime and the food came within 15 minutes and the service and food were spot on. I had fusion tacos again and my husband tried their enchiladas with different meats. So far so good.

But during my most recent visit on a weekday and lunchtime with coworkers, all sorts of things were off. The water tasted funny and they put the skimpiest portion of pork belly meat in one of my tacos. A coworker and I both asked for kimchi on the side. Hers was a generous portion and was on a small plate, like a true kimchi side dish. Mine? Well, it looked like a few kimchi shavings in a small tin container like what people use to hold ketchup or tartar sauce. I asked our waitress what was up and she said that the kimchi orders are the same (really?) and that there are 2 different chefs that made our items. So I got the short end of the deal then? Sigh. Anyway, our waitress never offered to remedy this blatant inconsistency in the food- which I thought was bad form. Food should be consistent even in the case of two different cooks/food preparers.

Driver arrived 20 minutes early, and as we were trying to check out and come downstairs to meet him, he had already left. We talked to customer service on the phone, and they said there was nothing they could do, and hung up on us. We lost the money spent for the reservation, and had to find alternative transport. I have used Super Shuttle and have never had a problem until now. I realize that things happen, but I will not use Super Shuttle in Las Vegas again, as I am more than disappointed with their customer service!!",1.0

"Wow! So happy to see this place open on the East side of Mesa, we have had to travel so far across town to get Vietnamese. Now we have it within 5 minutes, but it's so much better than the places on Dobson Rd. We had the Pho and the Bun, both were extremely fresh and delicious, best we've had!

"The building is great!  We had a party of 15 and a single server took care of all of us, which was impressive. 

I actually wasn't that impressed by my steak. Perhaps it was because I just got a standard filet. Perhaps it was because it was cool by the time I ate it, but it didn't seem to be anything special. I did enjoy the bourbon creamed corn.  The mixed drinks were also fairly weak. 

I'm glad my company paid for dinner. If it had been on my own dime I would probably downgrade to a 2 star rating.",3.0

"Ok, so I just met my friend at Chili's for lunch to celebrate his birthday.  Let's forget for a minute that I drove to the wrong one (The one in Tempe that is now closed) and that he had to sit there by himself until I got there.  That's irrelevant.

We got there just before the lunch rush, and service was good.  One huge plus, my drink never got empty.  He was a little slow on removing the empty glasses, but it never got overwhelming.

I got a regular burger and fries.  The burger was so-so - it seems like they may have gone down in quality from the last time, the meat wasn't much better than a Whopper.  The fries were perfect, I love the seasoning they put on them, and they were nice and fresh.  The burger and bun never seemed to get along, and I ended up with a pile of soggy bun on my plate. 

My friend got the chicken strips, and was satisfied, personally, I have never cared for the way they bread them there - too much like fish - I prefer more crispy chicken strips.  His corn on the cob was excellent - I actually kinda wanted to steal it from him, but it was his birthday.

Service got a little slow waiting for him to pick up the check and bring my change, but in their defense, the lunch rush was starting to peak.  

Overall, it was a great meal for $25, and wow, is the tab less when there's no booze involved.  I hadn't tried this specific Chili's before, but it holds up the chains reputation well.",3.0

"I had passed by this place several times so I finally decided to stop by as I was craving a salad and my partner a sub. We decided to switch it up for once and not go to subway.. so anyway ordered the bacon, ham and turkey salad and my partner the pastrami 10"" sub to go, i was excited to take it home and try it. I got home and took out the box in which the salad was in and it was a good size box I opened it and I was VERY disappointed, there in a corner of the box was a little lettuce with maybe 2 small pieces of bacon and shaved ham it was very plain..I should've went to burger king and got a better and bigger salad for the same $6 price and, as for the the sub it was very dry and plain my partner was very disappointed as well.

"Had a nice meal here today. Not my normal type of spot (prefer the more authentic divey types) but had some colleagues that wanted to hit it.

Service was great. Chips were good and were replenished throughout. Salsa was tasty. Drinks were kept filled.

As far as the food, it came out quickly, was hot and tasted good. Our table did 3 orders of pollo fundido (me included) and a shredded beef chimichanga. Nothing crazy but no complaints from anybody at the table. Though we did the poco lunch size, all of us had enough for another snack. Beans & rice were nice enough as well.  In some of the more chain-type spots, I find myself skipping on the rice & beans once I try them.  Wasn't the case here. They were good and I would have cleaned my plate if I didn't find myself ridiculously full about 2/3 of the way in.

While I won't seek out Ajo Al's, I definitely won't cringe as I sometimes do when work colleagues lead me to chains. I guess it is a local chain with only 4 locations after all.

No complaints.",3.0

"When my friend & I went to visit Phoenix in January 2011 we did a day tour of the Grand Canyon with Southwest Tours. I wasn't sure what to expect since there weren't many reviews for them on the internet but they looked good enough through the few things I read and now I'm really glad I went with them!

Lee was our driver/tour guide & he was chock full of knowledge on just about everything! He talked to us during the entire drive from the moment we got into the van, which in itself was very roomy & comfortable. He shared facts about each town we passed, little tidbits you probably won't find in tour guidebooks, and told us all about the different animals, plants & cactus we saw while on the road. 

The group we were with was a small group of 5 people so it had a really nice, cozy feeling. Lee was very accomodating whenever we needed to make an emergency bathroom stop, which happened somewhat frequently with all the complimentary water they gave us! Haha. We made many stops along the southern rim of Grand Canyon & we were taken down on a few trails that were away from where most of the visitors usually congregate & with spectacular views so we got a chance to enjoy the beauty of nature in a peaceful environment.

I highly recommend Southwest Tours & would definitely consider using them again the next time we go out there for a visit.",4.0
"I've been using this service since it started 2 or more years ago. For the first year or so, it was excellent and deserving of a 5 star rating. At $10/day, the level of convenience and customer service delivered was an extraordinary value that I found easy to justify to myself and to my company. The business delivered a premium parking experience at a modest price; in other words, the value proposition was very strong.

Full disclosure: I'm a frequent business flyer who has traveled weekly for many years. The business valet was a huge improvement over the daily garage or satellite lots (to be honest, the best parking experience ever was the old Remote lot...RIP.) 

However, as the construction got worse around the airport, and word got out about the Business Valet, the service has degraded to the point where I use it only when running late.  It seems like it was a victim of its own success. It also seems like the management was not able to handle the service past a certain level and has been struggling ever since. Their processes and systems were built to handle the initial load, but at some point, could not keep up with the upsurge in growth and volume. As the price was still $10/day, I found it difficult to go back to self-parking.

Earlier this year, after the airport commission fiasco, CLT raised the rates at all it's parking facilities. The airport also changed the company that was managing the service. My sincere hope was that the rate increase would shed traffic from the business valet and, along with the new management, restore the customer service back to it's original levels. 

Sadly, it's now May and though the traffic seems a bit lower, the customer service is still awful. Last night I started calling with my claim number from the plane. The phone rang and rang and rang with no answer. I tried back a few times and was finally greeted with a rushed rude voice. Making my way out to the curb, I joined dozens of others waiting for the shuttle bus. When the 10 passenger bus pulled up, I was fortunate to get on. 

Arriving at the facility, we had to wait in yet another line to pay. While waiting, the phones were ringing and not being answered; I sympathized with the frustrated callers on the other end. 

After paying, the clerk ventured off for the minutes long and fruitless search for my keys. I was then told my car was still being retrieved...despite a full 15 or 20 minutes passing since I called for it. 

As I waited on the sidewalk for my car to be found and brought around, I swore to myself as I have for a year now that I wouldn't use this service again. It's definitely nowhere near the value it once was. It is not a premium or even an above average level service. It's now a mediocre service at a premium price. 

The employees themselves are friendly and hard working.  I see this as a management failure more than anything. They lack the experience to implement the proper processes to run the business as it should be. They've lost sight of why customers would choose this service over self-parking. Hint: It's about the experience.",2.0

"Came here for the Bradley vs Marquez fight. Im excited because this was my first ever live boxing match and my first time ever at T and M. Was all ready to pay for parking but pleasantly found out that you didn't have to. Parking was half full but we had a disabled person with us so we got to park right in front of the arena. 

Like all hyped up epic boxing matches, there are always undercards that go before the main event so that whatever drama that has been building up since its announcement can marinate in everybody's minds. 

Of course, until the main event comes around, the arena is only half full. It's like a party atmosphere until then no matter who is on the undercard. I would say about 3/4 of the crowd were Mexican pulling for Marquez. Lots of Mexican flags being waved around not the mention all the cervezas flowing.

The sound system is nice and loud especially when they play music for introductions and videos played on the big screens. The only bad thing was that when they actually spoke into the mics, it wasn't as loud and not very clear.

What makes this a 4 instead of a 5 star review is not because of the lousy mics, its because of the lousy overall design of the parking lot logistics. Earlier, we were ecstatic because we scored a disabled parking spot. Only problem was that getting out was a total nightmare. Since we were basically parked in front of the entrance of the arena, a massive amount of attendees were all over the place walking back to their car. This was probably the only time that cars did not have the right of way. You had people all over the place walking around like zombies. Yes you had parking attendees directing you where to go but it didn't matter because the people walking around didn't care if you were trying to get out of the parking lot. They just kept on walking like there were no cars at all rolling around. This definitely has to be redesigned. Im sure this is not as bad as a problem at other arenas.

Overall, I had fun up until we had to leave. Maybe next  time we we just wont park so close to the arena. Oh btw, the fight went the full 12 rounds and Bradley won by split decision.",4.0
"I really do like Euro Pizza.  The first time I had their pizza was next door at Grapeables (another great place).  The Mediterranean pizza is what we usually order from here, however we have ordered the chicken roll and the Greek salad.  So far my only complaint is the menu states the Greek salad is mixed greens but it's really ice burg lettuce (ick).  

Every experience at Euro Pizza has been pleasant.  We are greeted by multiple people upon arrival, always seated right away and the view of the Fountain Park is amazing.  The staff is very attentive with refilling your waters / cocktails and the food comes out fairly quick and you always see a familiar face.

"They've got a little but of everything. If you're looking for home items, they're the place to go. A lot little eclectic items that you wouldn't find most places. 

In the past month, I've been like 3x, each time I walk out with more than I wanted. Last nights visit, however, kept me in the store longer than expected. All I wanted to do was an exchange, but note that's extremely difficult without a receipt. I didn't want NY money back just the normal, I'll give you a gift card. Finally, after their computer taking 10 min to process, I was able to get out of there with what I wanted.

"A very odd thing happened when I opened a present that I received from my girlfriend - the product was not inside of the box. We decided to go to Target to try and exchange it.

We were a little hesitant at first. We thought maybe they wouldn't believe us, but ultimately we decided we should at least try. We found the receipt and left.

When we arrived, we explained the situation to the guy behind the return desk, Amir. He was very understanding. He said that he's heard of this happening but has never actually witnessed it. He needed to speak to a manager about it.

Latoya arrived and she was very helpful. We explained the situation to her and she okay'd the exchange. The item however was not in stock so Latoya called other nearby Targets to see if the had the product and if they could hold it for us. Great customer service.

Kudos to Amir and Latoya for their help!",5.0

"Definitely one of the best veterinary clinic I've been to. Dr. Soltero (or they seem to typically just say Dr. Mike) was amazing.

Our cat Latte had managed to eat two dryer sheets (.... don't ask.) When we called the clinic at 7AM as they opened, they agreed for us to bring Latte in immediately. Dr. Mike was extremely patient and thorough. He gave us full detail on what he was going to do (kept Latte there to do x-ray a few hours after giving him barium, fluid, antinausea + antivomit medication, etc.) Unfortunately Latte eventually had to undergo surgery to remove the dryer sheet, but it all went well.

The next two days Latte was being stubborn and wouldn't eat anything, I had to take him back. Every single visit to that small room, Dr. Mike was nothing but patient, gentle, informative and of course, helpful. Unlike many other vets I've seen, that they can't wait to get out of the room soon as they think they've done giving you the basic. Dr. Mike would always be around long enough to answer any questions, (I think) even hang around a few more minutes just to see if you eventually think of something to ask.

And the staffs are also very warming and compassionate. When I called in today to tell them how Latte had finally started eating on his own (with excitement), the staff over the phone genuinely sounded almost as exciting as I did, said ""omg of course it's a great news, I'll go tell Dr. Mike RIGHT NOW!"" :)

Latte's definitely on his way of recovery right now. He finally stopped missing his dryer sheet and started eating his real food. We can not thank Dr. Mike and Saguaro Veterinary clinic enough.

Bottom line, this IS the clinic to go, imo. :-)",5.0

"This place has pretty good food. I had tortilla soup which I'd never had before but loved it. I also ordered some tortillas but they were mostly charred. I also had some mini chimis and they were ok. Bit dry.

I docked it two stars however because of the way the servers are forced to work. I was with big parties both nights I was there, and the restaurant seats them and has no manpower to take care of them if it's at all busy. 

The first night, my server Fannie was an absolute sweetheart. I told the manager and he said that he'd only been there 5 days and had already added her as ""one of his favorites"". I'm sorry dude, you're nice and everything but five days in you shouldn't already be having favorites. I mean Fannie should be everyone's favorite but hold your judgement for a couple weeks man! You don't even know your staff yet! He also said that if I wrote a good review about her she would get a chance to join a raffle for free work uniforms and stuff like that. That seems wrong to me. Uniforms should be paid for by the jobs anyway. (I should know, because mine aren't either and it's bull. How are you gunna make someone pay to work at a place?!) 

Anyway both nights the place was understaffed and the servers had good poker faces but they were drowning. It took forever just to take our orders because the servers were stretched so thin. Then the food took forever because there weren't enough cooks. 

In all it took over half an hour to get me some water (the second night, I don't know who that server was but it wasn't Fannie! That angel kept me and my friends quenched! But I know the second server was also in over his head with customers poor thing) 

And over an hour to get food. So I would definitely recommend this place in small groups and either on slow hours or with patience. 

I would also recommend people to start applying here and help these servers out! You rock Fannie. You deserve better.",3.0

"I just moved and I don't have my washer and dryer installed yet, so I figured I just skip on down to the ol' laundry mat and get some towels/sheets washed. This is my first experience at a coin-less laundry mat...lets start with first impressions. It smelled really nice, and considering it was located in a very rundown shopping center, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not AS rundown as the rest of the center. 

I know I needed to wash my clothes...but there were a lot of washers to choose from and I had no clue where to get started, but luckily right in front of me there were a line of washers claiming to do 30 lbs of clothes (about three loads) at once! Oh, that sounds good to me, so I throw most of my clothes into 4 available machines (yes, I had a lot) and I go to figure out how to get money on my 'coin-less card' - There was a guy putting money on his card and I walked up to him and I was like ""How do I get one of those?"" (pointing to the card) He looked at me for a second and then said, ""I only know how to put money on it."" Okay, so he walks off and I just stand there trying to understand the 'help' video that is now on the Spanish cycle...I was hoping my high school Spanish classes would kick in and I would magically know exactly what that stupid little video was say, but I had no such luck... 

The lady who was working there soon found me wondering around near the help desk and she showed me how to get a card and put money on it. So, I didn't know how much this was going to cost me, so I just start with 5 dollars - I'm thinking ""hey I could at least do the 4 loads started while I find another open washer to throw the rest of my stuff into."" So I go up tot he first machine and it's like $5.95! What!? Does it really cost that much?? So I go back and put more money on my card...what I don't like about this, and I picked it up immediately, was the $5.95 or my next washer (which held 60lbs of laundry - where was this one the first time!) was that the prices weren't equal dollar amounts so eventually I ended up with .35 cents on my card. I can't use that 35 cents - and the money machines conveniently do not take change, only paper money so you are stuck with odd amounts of unused money on your card! LAME. 

Okay, while I was waiting for my washes to finish and eventually my drying as well, I saw a few cockroaches (kids, there with their parents, were even playing with them...ah to be young again...) my clothes never really did get all the way dried. And maybe if I stayed way longer I could have gotten them completely dry but I was done with the smell (which was pleasant at first but by now -almost 2 hours later - was starting to give me a headache) and I was definitely done with the brave little cockroaches coming out to play with everyone. 

The lady working there was really nice and really helpful. Even though all she did was stare at me when I complained I would never get my .35 cents back.",3.0

"My husband had bookmarked Spiga Cucina a while ago, the restaurant is a pretty far drive for us but we decided to go on Saturday night. I had made a reservation for us, but we still had to wait for about 10 or so minutes to be seated. Our waiter came by shortly after & gave us time to browse the menu.

I ordered the Tagliatelle Gambari -- pasta with shrimp, garlic, shallots, tomatoes, & spinach tossed in a white wine-garlic butter sauce. My husband got the Spaghetti Amore -- pasta with chicken & roasted red peppers in a sundried tomato cream sauce.

The Tagliatelle was light and tasty, it was a good summer pasta dish. If I got it again, I'd ask for it to be made without the tomatoes. The Spaghetti was a bit heavier with the cream sauce but also tasty. We had leftovers of both pasta dishes and while I normally leave those for my husband, I actually ate both of these!

Whenever I see creme brûlée on the menu, I can't help but ordering it. This dessert here was darn near perfect! It was light and creamy, super tasty. My husband is a take-it or leave-it kind of person when it comes to dessert but he actually ate half of this creme brûlée!

Overall, if you're looking for an Italian restaurant in the area, I'd recommend checking out Spiga Cucina. I'm not sure when we will make a trek back out that far north, but whenever we do, I already know what I am definitely getting .. the creme brûlée of course!",4.0

During my second fitting in January, she told me that I would have to pick up my dress in Feberuary because she was going to be on vacation in April and May.
I understand that vacations are great but she is going on vacation during prime wedding season! If I would have known right off the bat that I would have had to pick up my dress in February from her, I would have immediately gone somewhere else. I wasn't allowed to lose weight or anything (which, who doesn't want to lose weight before their wedding??) because that would change the way the dress fits me.

My dress didn't need much done. Just a hem, minor take in at the bust, a bustle, dry cleaning and the fastening of a few loose beads because I bought my dress used. That was almost $500 total. 
During my final fitting, I had some concerns and all she said was that it was ""normal.""
I am not by any means a picky or hard to please person so when I have a concern, it's generally not about something that is ""normal.""

When I tried on my dress just last week (2 weeks before the wedding) to make sure it still fit good, I noticed that the beads were still loose and my MOH and I could not figure out how to bustle it. When we did it the way she told us, it looked so sloppy and the dress was dragging on the ground more than it should have. We even tried our own ways and it just was not working.

Because Jenny was on vacation, I had to go to someone else to figure out how to bustle it (10 days before the wedding!!!) When I went there, she told me that the bustle Jenny had done was done very poorly and that I would need to have it redone a different, more simple way. She also told me that the take in at the bust was done poorly because the ribbing was too visible (something that I was concerned about but was told was ""normal"") and I'll mention again that there were still several beads loose. I told her that I paid almost $500 to get my alterations done elsewhere and she said that it was way overpriced.

I just had to pay another $100 with this new shop to fix the bust so the ribbing doesn't show, the beads are fastened,and there is a more simple bustle technique. It would have been $50 but I was charged another $50 for a rush alteration which I am completely understanding of. If you are looking for a wonderful alterations experience... go to Sukie's Bridal!

I genuinely like Jenny and she is really sweet but I feel like I just wasted a huge chunk of money. 

I hope that everyone has a better experience.",2.0
"Absolutely delightful and delicious!

I miss the good old days when I used to live across the street from this place. It became my absolute favorite, great for romantic occasions and friend hangouts.

My personal favorites are:

- Pan seared scallops (I am a big fan, and they really know how to sear a scallop here!)
- White sauce pizza with pear and prosciutto
- Pistachio coated pan-seared Tuna
- Carpaccio
- Gelato for desert or delicious Cannoli Siciliani

mmmm

Paired with my favorite Aglianico wine :)

Enjoy!

PS I also find it extremely affordable for being such a delightful place, calm atmosphere, good music, also very quiet even on the weekends.",5.0
"Alan is a remarkable stylist.  His salon was recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed!  Having gone to chain hair cutting places for years, i decided to change things up a bit and go to a real salon with a real stylist and was very happy I did.  Not only was I listened to but time was taken to help me feel valued and cared for.  I left relaxed and with a great haircut at a price that was extremely budget friendly.  if you are looking for a wonderful experience that you won't believe, go here.  I'm going back for a manicure and pedicure...yes, this is a full service salon.",5.0
"Your typical greasy spoon. The hours are a bit odd; another yelper called them erratic, which is a perfect description. I have seen this place for years and I think I've seen it open all of twice, today being one of those times. It's also very small and manned by Rocky himself, who does all the cooking, so even though its small there can be a wait if the tables are full. They are only open for breakfast, so the menu is limited. Just eggs, omelets and pancakes mostly. The most expensive thing on the menu was $6.99 and you get a very large portion, so it's definitely affordable. Like I said, your typical frill-less greasy spoon.
*the Yelp header describes it as Italian, Mexican and Sandwiches (????) which is grossly inaccurate, so please don't try to go there for pasta or tacos",2.0
BAD SERVICE!!!! I waled in alone and no one came by to take my order for 15min. I asked the server 3 times to take my order and they pretty ignored me.

"I am a fan for their hand-pulled noodles!  Hubby wanted some soup dumplings so we decided yesterday that we will try out DK for lunch today.  We arrived and notice that Christmas décor was up.  Wondered if DK celebrated Christmas all year round or they are just super excited for Christmas and already put up the decorations.  The restaurant's chairs were all covered with red flowered fabric.  Lots of red everywhere.  Hurts the eyes a bit.  Chairs were uncomfortable.

Onto the food:
- Beef Soup Dumplings: We thought this was ok.  We definitely had better. Couldn't really taste the soup in these medium sized dumplings.  We will pass on this next time.
-Teppan Tofu:  We had to ask for some steam rice to eat with this.  The sauce was very flavorful.  The tofu were soft inside and somewhat crispy on the outside.  I thought this was above mediocre.
-Shrimp Fried Noodle:  The hand-pulled noodle is the best hand-pulled cooked noodle I have tasted to date.  The texture and chewiness was perfect.  The shrimps were perfectly cooked as well.  I have had my share of overcooked shrimp and it can kill a dish.  Not at DK!  

We also had to order a pot of hot tea.  We did noticed that another family of 3 that came in after us was given hot tea and steam rice without having to ask for them.  *Shrug

Additionally, we had to wait 45 mins to get our noodle and tofu dish.  The lady owner did apologize for the wait since her husband had to run out to the store to buy veggies for the dish.  But, it's ok.  She was very kind and we didn't mind waiting.

Overall, this is a 3.5 star restaurant to us.  We will be back to try other items.",4.0
"I don't normally write reviews if I don't have something nice to say, but I want to warn others. After going to Princess Nails once, I NOW HAVE A NAIL FUNGUS. I have been doing nails for years, and this has never happened.

I moved to Anthem recently, and I'm looking to replace my wonderful gel nail tech who I have been going to for years. I wandered into this place on a Sunday morning and asked if they do gel nails. YES was the enthusiastic reply. Then, the nail tech tried to do acrylic. (That should have been a clue.) Long story short, the nail tech gave me a full set of gels, but he didn't know what he was doing. 

I don't like dishonesty. They could have just told me that their normal gel person wasn't there. I would have come back. Now, I will NEVER go back. BUYER BEWARE.",1.0

"Cheap and fast oil change and I love their waiting room, big leather couches, roomy, away from the door, big tv...this is a really cool place to get an oil change and he alerted me to a bigger problem which did turn out to be pretty urgent (busted CV boot) but I took it to my mechanic who (and I already knew) charged me half of what they quoted me but my mechanic also asked me whether or not my car was making any noise beforehand and I said ""NO, everything was great until I went in to Big O for the oil change and he told me the CV boot was busted...why???"" and the mechanic said well look at it, and the rubber cv boot had a nice clean beautiful slice across it......and my mechanic's opinion was that Big O cut my CV boot theirself....after reading the other reviews of this place I honestly will never ever go here again, and Im sorry for all the trouble he caused me...I was without my car 9 days, had to bus, bum rides, missed some christmas events all so slimballs could make a fast buck.

"I was recently invited here by a friend who occasionally does stand-up at this location. I was visiting from out of town and  she thought we'd like to check it out.

The venue itself is nice enough. I've been in comedy clubs that were not a nicely laid out or kept up...this place wasn't dingy and sketchy as far as I could see. It was nice having it attached to the restaurant as well (way more menu options -  bacon wrapped shrimps were awesome in a decadent unhealthy way)) but it also meant if you needed to use a washroom you had to walk all the way through the restaurant to get to them. Also, when I arrived it was hard to tell where the club part was at first.

The line up was mixed...that is the case with most local shows anywhere you go. We all have different senses of humour, right? And even comics have their good and bad nights. Most were good, only one was painful and a couple were standouts.

Service was great in the beginning but my server seemed to lose interet half way through. Which is too bad because I probably would have had more to drink if she had just asked. Oh well.

I'm kind of between a three and a four for this one. Perhaps I'll check it out again whenever I'm back in town.",3.0
"The setup is laid back for this place. 
Their claim to fame are the sliders and can be ordered in a mix and match configuration (3,5,7 and 10) I would say if you are larger group for sure go for the 10 count. 
I ordered a 3 count with 2 beef and one catfish. The beef was so so but the catfish was a pleasant surprise. I would come back just for the cat fish again if in the mood for sliders and perhaps even try other non beef iteration. 
Beer list though long needs a bit more diversity. Cocktails seem to be their forte' along with the sliders.

"Mimi's in general is consistently going downhill.  No matter what location, the service is sub par. Coffee?  Can't even wave someone over for a refill.  Muffins are a specialty, but 9 am in a Sunday they are explaining that they really haven't baked everything yet & didn't have what's in the menu. Pancakes were dry & chewy & my husbands croissant breakfast sandwich could hardly be cut & the cheese was just congealed over the egg like it had just been thrown in a microwave. Over the past 4 years I don't know if ownership or management has changed. The menu definitely has. The only reason we come in occasion is because someone from another state gave us 2 large gif cards. When those are yo, so is Mimi's. A shame really.",3.0
"sitting at the front, feeling part of the sweaty and every increasing lineup by the door was not the best seating arrangement for us, but we did manage to order some interesting food and have a relatively romantic time.

we started with some butter tea.  mmmm youd think, but as my bubbie loved to say at the smell of a fart lets say, ""feh"".  in my opinion salty tea that tastes like butter is not the right combo.  i hate to stain the face of an iconic tibetan drink but hey, prove to me that i got the lemon of the bunch and im all for it.

the first dish to arrive was a lentil soup that was very tasty.  after that came the famous ""momos"".  these are very intricately shaped dumplings.  if you could be a little fly flying above them it might look like a gigantic bike wheel, spokes and all, but made of dough, that you, as the fly could barf on and then eat, and then barf up again and then...

well they didnt make me want to barf in the least.  they came with a very tangy sauce, and ours were filled with spinach and cheese.  i would have liked to try the meat or seafood versions, but it almost doesnt matter when there are dumplings of any origin on the table.  i did find them a bit doughy for my undivided liking, though.  

as my main, i had a shrimp dish with veggies that was very juicy and mixed well with my rice.  the other dish i got which was unnecessary and not all that interesting was a type of specialty bread they make. it was like foccaccia on steroids and i tried to like it by dipping it in stuff but it was no great shakes.

i would come back again if i was in the area, but id just as soon expand my horizons and try other tibetan places as well.",3.0

"This place reminds me of Ken's pancake house back in Hawaii, with many pancake choices and Hawaiian food here and there. This new location has a shorter wait than the original store on weekends and it's much roomier so I prefer this store. 

I was the one who wanted to go here, but my friend who has a sweet tooth started getting more excited than me as he perused the menu. No surprise since the pancakes sound more like desserts than breakfast food. We ordered a few to try - red velvet tastes like dessert with marshmallow whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, while white chocolate and the others taste just like normal pancakes with fancy toppings. Also, the kalua pig benedict didn't taste like normal kalua pig so I wouldn't recommend it. 

Stick with the red velvet pancake here. Expect it to taste like dessert. And a short stack is more than enough for two people, trust me.",3.0
I havent been here in about 8 years due to a bad meal I had long ago that I couldnt shake.  So I decided while I was Uptown having lunch to give it another go...it has been afterall about 8 years.  I have to say I was extremely impressed!  Everything was exceptional and well made.   Our waitress Alex was so sweet and knew the menu well and recommended the lobster bisque which wasnt on the menu.  It was perfection!  HUGE lumps of lobster meat swimming in a rich creamy broth.  OMG..it was so good.  Plus the truffle fries are the best Ive had in Charlotte so far!  The manger Bryce was so nice and accomodating.  He went out of his way to make the experience great.

   I have now been to this amazing restaurant 7 times and the last one was with a large party. The owner and staff are great  and always accommodating.Their knowledge of the products of which they serve is superb.
   Now for the good part, the food and beer! Everything I have tried here is fantastic. The brick oven bread is a great appetizer, soft doughy bites that come with a marinara sauce that is to die for. Their prosciutto wrapped asparagus is phenomenal, granted anything with prosciutto is :p.  Last night I had the special which isn't on the menu but its up on the board in bright pink writing! This pizza is too good for words, I added a prosciutto base (shocking I know) and feta and the flavors from these just complemented this pizza.

"My friends and I were in Vegas to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. We thought that Turnt Up Tours would be a great way to do that. And it definitely was. Our host, Lolo, and her assistant for the night, Amanda, were incredible. They were always checking up on us and made sure we were having a great time. Every time we got into the bus, they gave us whatever mixer we wanted so we could get to the fun as soon as possible. We got some Mardi Gras beads as well.

Going from club to club, Lolo was super organized. She let us know where were going to meet up and where. Kept everything very efficient and extremely fun.

The clubs themselves were pretty fun. With the tour starting at 10pm, the first club we went to, Surrender, was pretty dead, but it did start to pick up as our hour there was wrapping up. The DJ was playing a lot of EDM, which I'm not the biggest fan of. 
The next club, Light, was pretty awesome. Lots of hip-hop, which is more of my speed. This place was definitely more lively than the first, most likely due to the time we were there. Lolo checked-in with us while we were here and even danced with our group for a little while.
The last club, Chateau, was cool too. It was inside the Eiffel tower and the music was fire. A lot of hip-hop again. Don't know which was more responsible for our fun there; the club itself, or the liquor, but we had a blast.

tl:dr I highly, highly recommend Turnt Up Tours. It was definitely one of the highlights of our weekend in Vegas. You're guaranteed to have a fantastic time.",5.0

"This was my first food and cultural festival in Las Vegas.  One of the many benefits of living in a large city is the cultural diversity and what better way to experience it than going to a festival like this.

After a hike, two of us drove to the Clark County Government Center Amphitheater in downtown Las Vegas.  There was plenty of parking when we arrived.  At this festival, you purchase cards in different denominations to be paid to buy food or merchandise.  There was a table at each end of the food vendor area that sold the cards.  I got $20 worth which came as one $10 card, one $5 card, and five $1 cards.  The vendors give you change in cards so all money is handled in one area.

My friend and I first walked along to look at all the food offerings.  The vendors are under the canopy opposite the performing stage at the amphitheater.  The first set you come to were all food vendors and the second set were all clothing, jewelry, and assorted services such as tarot readings and henna tattoos.  

After our walk, we headed back to the food vendors.  We started with splitting an order of chicken momos that came with a tomato based dipping sauce that had some nice spice to it.  That, along with some mango lassi, made for a good appetizer.

The amphitheater has a large grassy area but we set up our lawn chairs under some trees for shade.  After meeting another person, we went back and got some more lunch.  I got an order of pani puri that was something I'd never tried before and it was very good and very filling.  It was explained to me that this was Indian fast food.

Before we left, we watched some of the Raas competition.  We weren't close to the stage but it was better to stay out of the full sun and watch from our seats.

I later learned that the Vaisakhi festival is a traditional Sikh spring harvest festival.  I am certainly a fan of the festival and I'll be back next year.",4.0

"I have gone to this office for almost three years and always had a positive experience until just recently. I am giving them 1 star because of their cancellation policy. I called in March when I had a horrible flu and made an appointment for the next day. When I called I asked, ""If I feel better tomorrow can I call and cancel the appointment?"" and was told that would be fine. I left a voicemail first thing the next morning that I was canceling the appointment, then received a call later that day that I had been a ""no show"" and this would be marked on my file. I called back and spoke to someone that said it was a misunderstanding and that the note would be removed from my file.
I just called to make an appointment for tomorrow and was told that because I had been a ""no show"" I had to pay a nonrefundable $35 fee to book an appointment. I told her the situation and she said that they considered cancellations within 24 hours of the appointment time a ""no show"" as well. 
I did not keep my appointment out of principle- I have never been late or missed an appointment before and feel I deserved one warning (I had no idea they had this policy!)- and also because I think $35 is unreasonable. I am a teacher that does her best to conserve money and having to pay $35 for nothing means I have to find a new doctor.
I recommended this office to friends before and their opinion was this office is just looking for money. When you walk in they are advertising skin care products, weight loss services, and aesthetic services which are all very expensive.

"IMO this is the best crab in Las Vegas. Hush puppies doesn't flavor their crab and Hot N' Juicy crawfish is pricey and doesn't give you as much crab. My next stop was Cravin' Cajun which was reaaaaal good until they went out of business, so finally decided to check out The Boiling Crab.

No trouble finding parking, it is inside a local shopping center. Had no trouble getting seated, no wait. It is cafeteria style or you can sit in a booth in the back which is were we went. The service is fast, I order 2 pounds of Lemon Pepper flavored crab, it came with potatoes which were delish.

The flavor was so good cooked spicy to your liking, I always order more after I blow through my 2 pounds. I like it better than Hot N' Juicy (don't get me wrong, I also like Hot N Juicy, this is better tho). If your a crab fan check this place out, better priced than the competition.

"Having seen that the line for the Wynn Buffet was at least a good hour and a half long, my friends and I headed a little further down the hall to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.  

Once she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.  

My entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.

My dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a true New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.

The service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.

The one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.  The lower part of the seating area overlooks the beautiful pool.

Overall, quite disappointing, especially for the price.",2.0
"Very nice place with great service. Hostess sat us right away. The waiter came over right away for drink orders and got the drinks out to us within 5 minutes. It was happy hour and very busy in the bar area. We sat in the restaurant and weren't allowed to order off the happy hour menu. We had a child with us so I guess that means you can't participate with the special menu in the bar. Kind of annoying. But the waiter did give us happy hour drink prices at least. He was as accommodating as he could be. The fresh made chips and salsa were delicious. The spicy salsa wasn't as spicy as it was made out to be but it was very full of flavor. The waiter explained the menu items perfectly. The ceviche was pretty good. I prefer the shrimp cut up but it all tasted good. I had the enchiladas veracruze I think it was called. Chicken, spinach, queso fresco and a very spicy sauce. It was good but I will try something else next time. My friend had the crab enchiladas. It had a fancy name that I can't remember. It was amazing. The waiter said it was really good. A little more expensive than I would've liked but not outrageous prices considering the quality of food and fabulous service. Even when it got busy our waiter was still on top of everything. Overall it was a great restaurant.",4.0

Great massage place hidden in the same plaza upstairs next to Ichiza.  They offer foot massages and full body massages.  I came in to do a foot massage and my husband did the body massage.  The facilities are clean and quiet.  The massager was very professional; his phone went off during the session but he did not answer it.  Parking is a bit difficult in the plaza due to all the popular restaurants but you can always park next door.  Will be back!,5.0

"It's airport food. I've come to not expect much when dining at McCarron. The typical experience held true. Not overly clean (pieces of dried food left on silverware in this case we well as silverware and napkins under our ""clean"" table) and no real sense that anyone cares that you are there. But I guess when you have a captive audience, why try?

The positives about this experience were the food - my Mediterranean-influenced grilled chicken salad was very tasty. The chicken was dry but flavorful, the kalamata olives were sliced very tiny, but plentiful and the dressing was light in texture. All over, a great value for the quality and location ($11). My husbands pepperoni pizza was also a nice surprise. The pepperoni had a bit of zing to it and the cheese and sauce seemed fresh in taste. We both had water and found it odd that both glasses came with zero ice. 

Our server was pleasant and while the service wasn't terrific, she sure was better than some service we've had in airports.

So, for the money and considering the location, I'd suggest trying it. They also advertise a dessert of tiny doughnuts with both chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces. That sounded delish, but we didn't partake.",2.0

"Is there such thing as zero stars here? Coz that's what I would've given this place.  THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED and I've been to more than 20 countries in my life, to include Afghanistan.  Really the worst.  The people who work here have the stankiest, crappiest attitudes towards people.  Very aggressive demeanor!  I just witnessed a guy kick out an old lady who was searching for transportation to attend a family funeral.  Since greyhound didn't had have the itinerary she needed, she sat there for a second to check her phone for possible other tickets.  He kicked her out ASAP.  The bus was an hour late departing.  Everyone who works here rolls their eyes if u somehow forget to take your ticket out of the envelope and will yell at you.  Employees here have some miserable lives that seem to manifest in their work ethics.  I thought these bad reviews were just people being cry sacks.  But I see now that this place does suck!!!",1.0
"In the past 6 years of owning our boat (95 four winns, OMC 5.0 efi), we've been through 3 boat shops and a mobile boat mechanic. Happy to say we finally found a boat repair/maintenance shop that I trust.

Service, communication, and turnaround time was the best I've experienced. Took a week total (during the offseason), to diagnose, get my confirmation on the costs, get the parts in, and get her back. Couldn't be happier.

Had another issue during the beginning of summer (a few weeks ago), shop parking lot was grand central station with boats, previous experiences at past shops I expected six weeks (drop it off and forget about it till they call). Total turn around plus a list of minor issues, and redoing the bunks, was just over two weeks. 

Again, communication was great, boat runs awesome, they pointed out a couple things that should be addressed, I concurred, easy peasy.

Worked with Brett for the majority of it. Found my boat shop!",5.0

"To be honest, I am no expert on Pho and would never have tried this place if my friend hadn't introduced it to me and ordered (thankfully) for me. It can be pretty confusing since you order by the number of the item on the menu and the specific size. I always get the number 1 Large and I have still not been able to finish it all even on days when I go there starving. The Pho is fresh, the meat is tender and seasoned well, the service is fast and it's budget friendly too. A Large Pho cost me $10 the last time I was there. 
The only thing I have to complain about is the size of the restaurant, it is as cramped as the TTC during rush hours. Sometimes you have to wait to get a seat but the service is so fast you never have to wait long. 
Not exactly the most elegant place if you're looking for a nice dinner venue but good for a quick, cheap, filling and tasty meal!",4.0

"My Cleveland food truck saga continues! These guys were actually at Crocker park on Saturday. I don't know if Crocker Park has an agreement worked out with the food trucks or the food trucks know it is a great scene but they are there almost every Saturday morning. What could be better than some shopping with awesome food?

Anyway I was really excited to see these guys here as they have a slightly different menu than I'm used to from most food trucks. Tater tots anyone? Yes please. 

I believe I had some sort of pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing. One of the best pulled pork I have had in a long time. And that is sort of my favorite. 

The food came out promptly and they accepted my credit cards. What more could you ask for? 

Do yourself a favor and when you see this truck rolling around in the CLE make sure to stop by! You won't be disappointed.",5.0

First time here and I love it ! I will be back for sure. The food tastes great with the Asian/Latino blend.The staff is friendly and their area is very clean. This is located at the Desoto Central Market along with a number of other restaurants. I love the atmosphere of the Market. They have retained a lot of the looks and the features of the building which was built sometime in the 1930's! They have a parking lot on the south side of the building which is located at Central and Roosevelt in Phoenix. There is overflow parking lot at an adjacent church.,5.0
"I've travelled to about 40 countries, including Thailand many times.  AT BEST this was poor quality western Chinese food.  VERY disappointed if they claim this is Thai style.  So many other places for good Thai in Toronto. Way over priced for what you get.  

Save your money and disappointment and go elsewhere.  And they charge your tip on top of the tax too.  Terrible.


I had been here many times in the past, service atmosphere usually good, food was average.  

After many years absent, decided to bring guests and give it another try.  The front is renovated very modern, which I think ruins the old Thai décor.  The service was good although we asked her to suggest a combo for 4 and the only idea was to double a combo for 2, hardly creative.",2.0
"Took me a while to find this place the other day but glad I did.  The big sign on the building was ""pineapple express"" which was funny.  Only gave three stars because the posted price on yelp and other sites for the manapua (which was very good, almost as good a Libby's in Kalihi).  Internet price is $2 but when you go here it's posted at $2.75--that's a .75 cent increase which is very high just for manapua.  Three guys running the place and they were very friendly and open to wala'au with the customers-good feeling.  Don't go by the yelp menu prices because they are so wrong.  I'll be back for the ono manapua sometime down the road but with the price it's a little to high for a constant buy.",3.0

"Okay, I'll admit it, I Really like this place.  Ordered two dozen bagels for Thanksgiving and everybody in our family was impressed.  But then I ventured to the most flavorful combination yet.  Jalapeño/cheddar bagel split and toasted with bacon/horseradish cream cheese.  I know what you're thinking, but don't judge till you chew.  The Jalapeño flavor is not in your face, but somehow a smooth deep background flavor in the bagel that is full of flavor with gentle warmth.  That same careful integration of flavor applies to the cream cheese, and together, amazing.  My family went GaGa over the veggie cream cheese on just about everything, and the young kids came to blows over the cinnamon raisin bagels.  Big mistake not to have a couple more of those.  Awesome job.  Genuine, real deal.",5.0
I normally would love to give this place a 4/5 stars but they've finally disappointed me with the lack of amenities for brining a baby/young infant. Bathroom does not have a changing table and they don't have car seat caddies if you bring your baby in a car seat. Service is always friendly and food is always great.

"My wife and I went to the shop and they where very pleasant even explaining that it would be $49.99 to diagnose. Then my wife went back and it's true it's $49.99 to diagnose and then free if you get it fixed there but the part they don't tell you is that they will over charge you for getting it fixed there.

They wanted  $310.00 to fix the EGR valve (cost for part $68.99) and my son in law put it in in 10 minutes. Next was $180.00 for spark plugs ($15 for the part) one hour to be replaced. Finally $269.95 for the O2 sensor (part is $17.99) and that was put in at the same time as the spark plugs. There was no cost break down, for example labor time and or the parts. My wife paid the $49.99 and said goodbye. 

Now I understand making a profit but it seems to me they where trying to make a a killing on us when even at $95.00 an hour for labor (times 2 hours) the most we would've paid would be $292.00 and not a whopping $760.00.

Before you go there shop around first.",2.0

"I currently live here with my bf and our friend. The place is just okay. We live in the yellow building which I think is the best location in the complex. When we did move in we did find a bunch of dead sewer roaches, I get it I live in tempe it's full of roaches. I've seen a couple of roaches in our apartment but the managment do spray every friday plus our apartment is clean most of the time so I'm pretty sure the roaches are coming from my neighbors and when a monsoon hits. Something that annoys me though are the girls that work in the office. I feel like they dont know what they are doing! They are so unorgainzed and pretty much brain dead when it comes to asking questions or turning in forms. Before we moved here one of the girls lost our application and we had to fill out another one. Also getting thing fixed takes forever! My garbage disposal is still broken and it's been two weeks since I called the office to get it fixed. The complex at the moment is getting gates which is great because less creepers will be hanging around here, but the complex is charging us 50.00 each of us to get the clicker that opens the gate. Yeah we get it back when we move out but we moved here before the complex installed the gates! Over all we will see how we like it here, we are tired of moving around tempe.

Nice layout
gym 
pools
wood floors

Cons:
roaches

I tried their fresh pork shrimp rolls, the added cucumber gave it a fresh zing. Next, I tried a Viet staple: the rare beef pho. I was pleasantly surprised to see real rare beef! Noodle texture was good and firm, broth was a bit underwhelming on the fragrant side, but still acceptable. Their staples are good, their selection is large and expanding, and the service was exceptional.  I had only come in once before to get a Viet iced coffee and the hostess remembered me a month later. All in all, the food is above average, and I can see a lot of potential. I definitely look forward to coming back here!",4.0

I don't bank here, fortunately, but am forced in once a month as my landlord has his account here. This branch is the closest to my home, so it's my usual option unless I want to drive out of my way, but maybe I should. Regardless of the time or day of the week, they keep a max of two tellers helping customers (regardless how far out the door the line goes). I can't help but wonder if they care about it at all, I've watched many other people complain to the manager but none of the other 6 employees in this branch  are capable of helping you make a deposit I guess. At this rate, February's rent will be due by the time I get to the teller.",1.0

"Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to The Living Room with my sisters-in-law. 

Atmosphere: 4 Stars. 
I really liked this place. The place is very neat... garage doors that let the cool night air in and the little details of the place are cool. 
The only thing that would have made it better is if they had some soft lighting after dark. It was so dark inside around 8pm that I couldn't read the drink menu. 

Service: 1 Star. 
I think this place might hire people more for their looks than their actual skills at service. Our waitress was scarce until it came time to pay the bill. 

Drinks: 4 Stars. Pricey, but very good. I had the Red Sangria (blah! nothing special) and a peach martini. The martini was delicious and very strong which is a good thing when I'm paying $8 for it. I think next time I'll probably only have drinks here at Happy Hour. $8 for a small Sangria is a bit expensive for me. 

Food: 4 Stars. 
We started with two Bruschetta (steak and Gorgonzola; apple and fig). Very delicious! Next time, I'll probably stick to Bruschetta because they were so good. For dinner, I got 1/2 of a Prosciutto and Brie sandwich and a cup of Butternut Squash soup. The sandwich had one slice of fatty Prosciutto and a thin layer of Brie. Disappointing. The soup was EXCELLENT! If you like Butternut Squash soup, I'd recommend trying it here.

"We have been eating at this Grimaldi's location for over a decade because we really like the pizza, which we get twice a month but today's experience justifies this one star review because we were astounded and infuriated. I ordered pizzas by phoning in. My husband went in to pick them up and witnessed the server cut our pizza and remove a slice before handing us the box. We ordered three pizzas so when she handed over the pizzas she only showed the top two. At first they denied doing it, and then offered to make another pizza because clearly there was a missing slice... easy math when the original shape is a circle and a wedge is visible in the box. With 4 hungry kids at home my husband did not want to wait half an hour for a replacement pizza. The manager refunded him for the error, without really admitting to the incident. I come from years of working in restaurants and I would have fired anyone who I caught stealing from the business, and stealing from a paying customer. Grimaldi's please address this issue.

Had to literally yell at her just so the even worse manager would come refund my money. Wanted a refund after they gave me a pre made milkshake that was separated (must have been 2 days old) and looked like vomit! Also watched both managers throw onion rings and fries in the same basket and same oil and fry everything together. That's just gross. I don't want my fries tasting like onion because you're lazy. Even at mc Donald's they use separate oil for fries, chicken, fish , etc. I don't mind waiting long for something that's actually good.

"Ah yes, Presse Internationale, right next to the Second Cup on the south side of Bloor.

LOVE THIS PLACE. It's like a bookstore, but it has magazines. Lots and lots of magazines. 

They have the usual crap you can pick up at any convenience store (porn, fashion), but they also have all the specialty monthly publications (cars, sports, international/foreign, photography, psychology, music, travel, food, etc). 

You name the topic, they have a magazine for it, bitches! I'm serious. You can get a copy of Midget Monthly here!

My favourite thing about this shop is that you can hang out and READ everything without buying! Just like in Chapters/Indigo. No asshole clerk breathing down your neck telling you ""this aint no library, you buy!"". Nope, just a friendly Asian man who lets me read entire magazines and then leave.

"Just ordered a Maki Tray from here and was the highlight of my party! Everyone loved it! The rolls here are by far the best with very little rice, not like other AYCE restaurants. This restaurant is definitely worth trying! Eat-in may take longer than others but you just need to remember this is not a fast food restaurant! Must try if you're in the neighbourhood! 

Just came back here again for take out of a platter and it was the hit for the party! Called in and told them I'd pick it up at 5:30 and by 5:40 I got a call asking where I was as the platter was ready! Great food and fast service! Will definitely order a platter for all my parties!",5.0
"Church Brew Works provides a traditional beer hall atmosphere in a transformed church.  For a local craft brewery, Church Brew Works does offer some very tasty options on draft and what I would consider to be the best beer flight in Pittsburgh - in terms of tasting experience.  From a brewery standpoint, Church Brew Works certainly does not disappoint. 

From a food perspective, the brewery provides the standard pub options that would be expected.  There aren't many stand out options on the menu, but it is certainly not difficult to find something to hold over ones appetite between pints of the enjoyable craft beer.  The food selection leaves more to be desired, however, the food taste pairs nicely with the beers on tap. This is certainly a location where the drink rules supreme and the food merely follows.  A great location for an evening out with friends or for private events.",4.0

I made a huge mistake by a car from this dealership. The salesman or pushy and will lie about anything to get you to buy a car don't leave this dealership without getting everything that is promised to you. And don't forget that they put your loan through capital one auto finance it is an online only loan distributor. And if you want to sell your car later on down the road it to pay it off over the Internet and it takes 10 to 15 days toto get your title back. Making it almost impossible to sell your car to a private buyer without paying it off in full first. Pick any other Chevy dealer in town before you pick this one.,1.0

"You come here for the first time, you may think you're walking into some mystery basement.  You come here with a friend who's also never been here, they may think you're taking them somewhere scary.  Thankfully, neither of those are true!  

As soon you walk in the door, you're comforted by the fact that it's just a cozy little basement restaurant!  Coming here at 2pm on a weekday, you'll also be joining the ladies who lunch, just fyi, this is Shadyside after all!  I actually got the idea to come later (after the lunch rush) because of the Yelp reviews.  Good thing I did because the ladies who lunch had taken every table except for one!

Looking at the menu, the first thing that struck me was that this wasn't a lunch place!  Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  

Now I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  

Hot Tip:  Cash only!  Come on off peak times because it's tiny and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat during lunch hours or Saturday/Sunday brunch.",4.0

I choose the curry creamed mussels and my husband chose the fish tacos. Although both were in the starter section of the menu both portions were more than ample as a main for lunch.
The curry cream sauce was deliciously flavourful with the right amount of spices and shredded pepper and carrot. Served with three slices of a toasted baguette to sop up the yummy sauce it was the perfect size.
The hubby LOVED the fish tacos, grilled cat fish with a nice dry rub; 3 tacos in soft tortillas with lettuce, black beans, corn, jalapeño peppers and a cream mayo sauce. I had a taste and they were superb. Think I'll order them for myself next time!

"Ok...I have not used many dry cleaners in my lifetime, being more of a ""t-shirt and jeans"" kind of girl, but on occassion, I need to get SOMETHING dry cleaned, whether its a skirt, my fella's hat, or a suit jacket that we had borrowed from a friend.

My first experience with these guys was about a year ago.  My fella had dropped his hat off to be dry cleaned, and asked me to pick it up after work.  He told me that when he had dropped it off, that they promised they would be open til 6:30.

I pulled up at 6:15, opened the door, and walked in. 
Rather than being greeted, I hear ""WE'RE CLOSED!!""

Oh no you did NOT just yell at me.  

""Really?  Your door is unlocked, and I need to pick something up, and was promised that you'd be open til 6:30.""

They got the hat, but did so with a very pissed off look and attitude.  

Fast forward to 3 days ago.  My fella had borrowed a suit jacket for a movie scene he did some extra work in, and we wanted to dry clean it before returning it.  

So, I drop it off on my way to work, noting the signage on the windows that say ""Same Day Service!""

I asked the girl when it would be ready for pickup.  

""Oh...tomorrow.""

...ok...but your window says same day.
Its fine, really, not a huge deal, since we didn't need the jacket same day...but if you're going to advertise same day, you should make sure that it really is.

Yesterday morning, I went back in to see if it was ready.
Nope.  It hadn't been touched yet.  

Ok again...not a HUGE deal.  I ask how late are you open, and the guy says ""At least...8."" 

Do you not know your own hours?  At least 8.  That's a new one.  

So when I got off work yesterday, I stopped by, at about 6:20.  The girl took my ticket, and asked, with tremendous attitude ""When did you drop this off.""  

...""Yesterday morning. And I was told THIS morning that it would be ready tonight.""

So she looks, and she finds it.
$4.50.  Not bad.  I hand her a $10 bill. 

Her: *sigh* ""Do you have 50 cents?""

Me...""no, sorry."" Thinking to myself ""If I had, I'd have given it to you...""

She sulks around the corner to find my change and begrudgingly hands me the $5.50.  

And then, HOW DARE I ask for a receipt.  
""Its on the item.""

Ok fine lady, I didn't know!  
And next time, don't laugh at your customer for asking.

If they were not near my house and very inexpensive, I'd never use this company again.  There is never an excuse for rude service.  Ever.

"My husband and I get massages quite frequently and have been getting them for years. He likes the really deep tissue massages (the kind that hurts-due to back problems) and I like the more swedish type kneading massages and it's hard to find places that are able to give us both what we want (we've tried everywhere from massage schools to day spas to fancy/luxury spas) but we both agree that this place gave us both one of THEE BEST massages we ever had. We went while on vacay after our drive in from Cali and we totally wished we could bring our girls back home to Hawaii with us. I believe their names were ROSIE and ASHLEY but not too sure. 

While in Vegas, if you like massages, you MUST TRY this place. Service was AMAZING and the ambiance was cool too. Not your typical spa ambiance, I mean it was still relaxing but there was a rock n roll vibe going on. I don't know if that makes sense but I guess you have to see it for yourself to understand.

"So I have had the worst couple of days. A friend and I were at Rehab pool at the Hard Rock Hotel when my whole bag was stolen. Inside my bag was my debit card, cell phone, drivers license, clothes, and worst of all, my car keys. Luckily for me I had an extra key at home which my dad brought me. This key however was only a valet key, meaning it did not open anything but the door. I had an extra cell phone and ID in my trunk, with no way to open it. My door had recently been taken apart due to fixing my car window so the only way into my trunk was with my key fob which I didn't have. We got David's phone number from a friend and we called him right away. He was absolutely incredible. He made multiple calls all while helping other people in the same situation. He had called back multiple times to update us on what he's found out. He went above and beyond to help us to unlock my trunk. Although there was no way to use the key, he informed us of the internal wires in the door that should help pop the trunk. He called to ask if it worked, he called and kept us updated, he was so helpful and informative and most definitely made my day a lot better. I want to say thank you immensely to David White at MX Locksmith for turning my day around and helping me through a tough situation. 100% recommend this company and will continue calling him with any further car key problems I have!",5.0

If you are a fan of VERY low-key Mexican food, this should hit the spot. Greasy spoon Mexican restaurant at the intersection of South Blvd and Tyvola Rd, it is a bit difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. I have never been there when it is crowded for lunch. I can usually get in, eat and pay within 20 minutes. Seriously, they are that fast, which is good if you are on a time crunch.

"I've passed this store many times but decided to take a look inside today. Staff is very friendly and will tell you more about the store. They were doing a fundraiser for Red Cross and if you donated (literally pocket change), you could receive 20% for items 10 days or older and more for items 30 days and older. The dates are located on the tag so you also know how long an item has been in the store. Items include handmade jewelry and ""gently used"" clothing items including shoes, purses and belts. I was happy to see such an array of sizes, including plus sizes. The store itself isn't huge but they do have it laid out well. I noticed a lot of the clothes came from Banana Republic so mostly name brand here. I did end up buying a cream colored shawl for $14. As a tip, some of the clothes did have signs of significant wear and small holes so look over clothes really carefully.

I was there to buy a take-out lunch today before the rush hour.  After I paid for the purchase, I took a seat next to the cashier and waited for 5 minutes.  Then a waitress came by and said to me: ""You have to wait outside (i.e. outside the restaurant in the hall) for your take-out.  If you sit here, people walking by our restaurant may think it is full and would not come in.""  I looked around and there were at least 3 empty tables and no waiting customers.  I told her if there are customers waiting for the seats, I'd gladly wait outside.  So I stay put.  Moments later, a Caucasian customer walked in.  She seated him next to me and said: ""There is customer now.  You have to wait outside.""   WTF!  I then told her I am also a customer too.  If I have to wait outside, then they can change my take-out order to dine in instead.  I told the gentleman sitting next to me about what's happening and asked if he mind I stay seated for another 5 minutes. He had no objection at all.  Then I told the waitress I already asked their customer and he doesn't mind me sitting with him.  At the end , they gave me my lunch and I left.  At the time of leaving, there were empty tables and no line up still.

"After visiting The container Store for a longer span of time than we thought we would, it was high time for dinner.  Eyeballing the several offerings of Town Square, we came across this California Pizza Kitchen.  There was a wait everywhere on this Friday night, but here it didn't appear to be intolerable.  So, we put in our name and waited to be called.  After about 20 minutes the lights on our pager finally glowed red and danced about.  Now hungrier than ever, we prepared to settle in our comfortable booth and enjoy a multi-course dinner at a relaxed pace.  We were not ready to rumble, but to EAT!

So, I began with Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, while Diane looked forward to an opening side of Traditional Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese.  The Lettuce Wraps were excellent, featuring fine chicken, tiny curved water chestnuts, jalapeno circles, very fresh and crisp lettuce leaves, and a nice soy-based spicy dipping sauce.  I did find though that the Cherry Limeade I also ordered was too strong for my taste.

The Mac 'N' Cheese had an excellent crisp crust, and was firm on the inside--not mushy.  The whole dish was quite yummy.

Unfortunately our Garlic Cream Fettuccine entrees then arrived right on top of our starters.  I sent mine back, but Diane accepted hers, which contained sauteed chicken and shrimp.  When my entree arrived again at a more suitable time, it was just like Diane's, except mine was further enhanced by sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteing was first-rate, the fettuccine was al dente, and just enough Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce clung to the pasta to make this a truly delectable dish.  The portions were large, with an ample amount of chicken breast chunks and medium- to large-sized shrimps.  We both enjoyed our hot entrees immensely.

But how is a fine dinner truly complete without a sumptuous dessert?  So, I finished with a towering slice of 6-layer Lemon Cake with Lemon Custard Filling, while Diane dug into a large slice of 5-layer Red Velvet Cake.  My high-caloric sweet treat was brushed with Limoncello, candied lemon zest, and Mascarpone Frosting, and was very lemony and delicious.  Diane's was topped by a creamy and very tasty Cream Cheese Frosting.  We were both in dessert nirvana.

One other service delay must be mentioned.  Diane seemed to wait forever for a Hot Chocolate.  We were ultimately told by both our server and the manager that the bartender on duty makes all Hot Chocolate drinks, and got behind making that and other ordered drinks.  Finally, the manager hustled over to our table with the Hot Chocolate way late, but did take it off the bill.  And then Diane found it to be too thin.

Even though our dining experience was marred by two service errors, the food was so delicious that we just brushed these minor inconveniences aside, and this outing still rated an overall 4-1/2 stars!",4.0
"First off, this place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Worst service I've ever had.

It was my friends birthday, and his girlfriend planned everything. There was 14 of us, and she made reservations. Everyone was so upset over the awful service and food, I felt bad. It wasn't her fault it was so horrible. Most people at the table complained. I didn't want to add to that and make her feel worse, so I promised I would write about it on Yelp.

The waiters were awful. Horrible attitude, didn't refill drinks, pretty much demanded we hand them things instead of getting it themselves. 
The portions were small, and not worth the price. Everyone but one person was missing a dish/drink or more. When people politely asked about their dishes/drinks, the waiters said, ""Oh."". Not, ""I'm sorry"" ""I will check on that""... Nothing. It seemed like we were inconveniencing them. 

The food was missing things, not cooked properly or enough and very small. The crab cake appetizer was small, and not flavored well at all. The lamb dinner was not good either...we asked for medium. It was barely pan seared, and it was practically pink on the outside. It didn't even come with the green sauce promised. The lobster Mac and cheese - the waiter, "" It's amazing, I highly recommend it, we're known for it."" It was extremely salty and tasted like boxed Mac and powdery cheese with two small pieces of lobster. 
Cesar salad - don't know. We never got it and were never asked if we still wanted it. 

They charged us $140 for 3 drinks, lobster Mac and cheese, small lamb chops and two crab cakes. They charged everyone 20% gratuity. It's usually 18%, but the waiter didn't even deserve that. He didn't even care to serve us much less care if we were even there. 

Do not eat here. Save your money and eat somewhere else before going to the Artisan. The hotel itself is awesome for the ambiance. But the restaurant...I promise, you are missing nothing.",1.0

"+.5 for service

I've been here twice now, the first one from curiousness when I dined at Yang's BBQ and noticed this interesting place popping up. I enjoyed it the first time so much that I reserved to come a second time the week after.

360 Seahood (intentionally spelled that way) is a restaurant that focuses on both grilled BBQ and boil in a bag seafood. However, the menu is all in Chinese, so best if you don't know Chinese to accompany with someone who knows how to read Chinese. The employees do know English though, although communication might be a bit slow at times.

I went with the lamb, beef, chicken, and sausage skewers, as those tend to be the staples of grilled BBQ. The meats all come raw and you have to put the skewers into a 360 degree revolving grill for it to be cooked. You can also put as much (or as little) spice and cumin as you like. Personally I prefer this system, as my spice tolerance is quite low and I find many places to overdo on spices even if I told them to not put less on. I was satisfied with the lamb, beef, and chicken skewers, but the sausage ones were large but lacked the juiciness of the other meats.

As for the boil in a bag seafood, I tried the one with clams, and I will warn you beforehand: The sauce is extremely spicy, and according to the employees there's no way they can reduce the spiciness. It probably tasted okay in the end, but I was bawling my eyes out with each bite so there was no way I could've finished them all.

Service was very good in my end, and if you don't know how to use the grill initially a server will teach you. For a place that's mostly catered to mainlanders (and hence one shouldn't expect top notch service), I was pleasantly impressed with the service here. I'll likely return if I'm in a grilled BBQ mood, although for sausages I'll likely stick to Yang's.",3.0
This was my first time here and I will never go back.  My hubby and I were excited to get alil dresses up and have some Italian and god did they mess that off. To start off when we walked in the place REEKED of piss. Like someone has literally just peed on the floor. Our waitress showed us to a booth in the back where they were scraps and trash under and around our table. I asked her for a drink list she informs me there isn't one k fine I move on. Then we get an appetizer the fried ravoli which was prices at 8$ but only came with four bite size pieces on a plate. That's it. Now onto the meal I order a tortellini and marinara and my husband got the tuna. Mine came out with random mixed veggies In it(which I just picked around) and my husbands came out fine except his sauces came in plastic cups(it was a 20$ dish). Oh and that's not the end of it. After telling the waitress that I didn't receive what I ordered we had to listen to her and the cook scream at each other while we at. She then have us our check and then disappeared. We waited until I finally stopped another waitress to cash us out. I paid 65$ all together and it should have been free.,1.0

"Chippendales is the best show in Vegas for the ladies by far!  I went here with fellow yelper Lily A. and friends for my 30th birthday back in 2009 (please refer to Lily A.'s review for more details) and for a second time in July 2012 for my cousin's 18th birthday.  They do allow ages 18 and up, but for those who are under 21, they must stay outside of the lounge which serves drinks.  The show is more of an experience, they wow you with the lights, music, and most of all...the bare chested men!  I have been to Thunder from Down Under and Chippendales is the original and the best!  I like the seating arrangement because we all pretty much have a good view, aren't restricted and have areas where the Chippendales dancers can come up to us and shake and smolder all they want:)    Everyone was screaming/panting for more and it was if every little move that those hunky dancers would do, sent us ladies into a trance;)  If you can get there early enough, you can enjoy some drinks before.  Also, after the show there is a lounge for 21 and up, to meet some of the dancers so you can pose and take photos with them as well as have them sign your poster or calendar.  Speaking of calendar, I got a free one just for checking in on the yelp app on my phone.

"We chose pizza again after a bbq competition and 1 Brothers Pizza was a winner!  We started off with some chicken wings and we all agreed they were delicious...crispy and cooked perfectly.  For the pizza, I hadn't had a Sicilian style pizza in quite some time so we went with that...with pepperoni.  So good!  The sauce was incredibly flavorful and it really hit the spot.  My husband and daughter both said, ""Best pizza in Arizona.""  I'm not sure that I would go that far, but it really was delicious and I'd definitely return.",5.0
"I am always amazed that people are quick to criticize for a variety of reasons.  I moved to this area in August 2015 from a place that was monopolized by Walmart's.  I travel often for my profession in the Retail industry and part of my job is understanding retail and observing market trends.
I often shop this Walmart BECAUSE the staff is accommodating, friendly and knowledgeable. I read the criticisms and found zero to be creditable for this particular Walmart. 
I shop at a variety of times. High traffic/ volume and late at night. I have personally observed the night crew stocking team and have noted how efficient and customer service oriented they are consistently.
The ammonia critique? Maybe you need to p-r-o-n-u-n-c-i-a-t-e your words. http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-enunciation-and-vs-pronunciation/

 Your ancestors were once immigrants  who I am sure put in a day's work for an honest dollar. I have observed the team leader  helping an older hard of hearing woman find some sort of feminine product with patience and diligence while she was unclear of what she was looking for to begin with, I was even impressed as an old retail hag of thirty years. 
The critique about profiling? Sounds like you are highly sensitive. Maybe it was you he didn't like? And, your Hispanic husband had nothing to do with it. Maybe you walk around with a chip on your shoulder and a simple Walmart employee was trying to make your day a 'little-better'. 

This store runs exceptionally well. From the Cashiers, Customer Service Representatives, Garden area and the stock team who pull double duty responsibilities and also  serve as sales associates.

I came on the Walmart site to look up pool toys and felt the need to defend the employees of THIS ONE LOCATION. 

to the Haters, get a life, you have a choice shop.  Somewhere else?  Basha's , Target Safeway.",5.0
"It's too bad I have to give this place such a poor review because the food on their very abundant menu isn't half bad. Let me start by pointing out the positive first: 

The menu has just about anything you can think of. Whatever you're in the mood for will most likely be listed. The ambiance is nice enough; nice seating, nice lighting, etc, etc. The price is right and they have a great drink and dessert selection. So what's the problem?

...Well, you know how the Jackson 5 said one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch?...Unfortunately, the service at this Yonge and Eglinton location just spoiled the entire silo...

  Sigh... I probably won't ever go back to this location again after what happened and here's why:
  I was there for dinner and drinks and from the start it didn't feel right. Our waitress took forever to greet us and the place wasn't even busy...No smile, no name, no connection at all from our server and first impressions usually mean a lot...even still, I was able to let it slide until I asked for separate bills. 

The waitress rolled her eyes and kind of grunted/sighed as a response. When the food was served, it was pretty much slammed down in front of our faces and never once were our waters refilled. As the night wore on and the service got worse, we had a bet going on as to who would find a big gob of spit in their plates...(no one did, luckily). 

The bills were wrong when given to us and when I asked for the manager to straighten it out I thought I was going to get my ears boxed! I'm not the type to complain or cause trouble at restaurants (side note: I've been a server before and I know first hand how stressful this job can be so I can empathize to a certain point) but the service was absolutely terrible. And when I thought the service couldn't get worse, the manager didn't even seem to care. Go figure.

 All in all, you may have a better server and a better night than I did here; I certainly hope so. If you want a decent meal, Pickle Barrel isn't bad but don't expect great service.",1.0

This place is really hit or miss. Sometimes the service and food is really great and other times it's pretty terrible. However I'm finding it to be terrible more often than good these last few visits. And sitting by the bar has brought some new insight as to how this place is run. I watched multiple servers grab the straws where people typically drink from and watched one lady stir a child's chocolate milk by the part of the straw where someone's child would drink. To make matters worse I watched the bartender drop a Marciano cherry on the counter then pick it up and put it in the drink. My fiancés burger was over cooked aka the patty was like rubber and the bread was stale. The only thing worth coming for is the fries...,2.0
Amazing burritos! The best I have ever had and I continue to try new places and am always disappointed. The owner/manager Marc is super friendly! They messed up my order once. It was no big deal.

My hummus appetizer was huge and delicious. I wanted to eat all of it but it really is better for sharing. I love lamb so I had the 8oz lamb chops. Really good I wish there had been more.

"The outside of the building is plain and nondescript, and might even make you wonder if you're at the right place. But once you step inside the Pinball Hall of Fame, you'll find yourself in pinball geek heaven, with just over 150 vintage and new pinball machines on display, which you can also play!

Pinball machines are becoming harder and harder to find, as the video arcades that used to keep a few machines in the back have gone the way of the dodo, now that one can have loud booming games with ultra-realistic graphics on their home console. But pinball was the game of choice for gamers in the 1970s and 1980s, back when Koopa Troopa might be confused for an ABBA song. 

So finding a place where playable pinball machines still exist is on its own quite remarkable, but finding so many machines crammed into a 10,000 square foot hall will leave even the average pinball enthusiast agog. What's more, the games you can play at the Pinball Hall of Fame span six decades.  

Here you will find a dozen or so pinball machines from the the late 1940s through to the 1960s, including King and Queens from 1965, which was featured in the movie Tommy, and Wild Wild West from 1968. These games are part of pinball history, with tiny flippers, rubber bands stretched across big bumpers, and analogue scoreboards that predate me, and I would otherwise never have had the chance to play.    

A good 40 machines let you experience pinball as it was played in the 1970s, including the Elton John tribute Capt. Fantastic, a Superman pinball machine, a classic Star Trek game, and a KISS machine. These were also before my time -- or at least before I was allowed into an arcade -- but were the iconic machines of that era.  

Another dozen or so machines are from the 1980s, like the famous Taxi pinball machine from Williams, but it's the 1990s that are really honored here with some 50 machines from that decade. These are the machines I remember the best, as I endlessly played many of these games (with their then novel pixelated displays) throughout my early and late 20s, when I lived across the street from a video arcade that has long since bit the dust. 

So it was very nostalgic to plunk down a couple quarters and play some machines I haven't seen in decades: making the Bride of Pinbot sing with her electronic voice; watching the flippers of the Addams Family machine snap along with its theme song; skillfully destroying an asteroid on Star Trek: The Next Generation with a single shot; and my all-time favorite, launching the inane Tiger Saw bonus illusion on the Theatre of Magic. All the machines were maintained in tip-top shape, and playing them made me feel like I was somehow transported back to a more carefree, whimsical time. Most of the games also feature cards and QR codes that provide you with additional details about their history. 

For those out there who only noticed pinball a bit later, there are also a good twenty or so machines from the past two decades including Ripley's Believe it or Not (2003), Family Guy (2007), and CSI (2009).  

You can also find a few classic arcade games strewn here and there. On my last trip to the Pinball Hall of Fame I spotted Dragon's Lair, Joust and Gauntlet Legends. 

The older games cost no more than a couple of quarters to play, and this museum is an established not-for-proft corporation. There is no entry fee, and the money collected from the pinball machines is used to repair and restore these classic games, with profits going to non-denominational charities, like the Salvation Army.

If you're staying on the south side of the strip (the Luxor, Tropicana, MGM Grand), a cab ride will cost you between $15 and $20 to get there, depending on traffic, and another $15 to $20 to get back. As the museum is a bit off the beaten path and the denizens wandering a few blocks away can seem somewhat sketchy, flagging down a passing cab might not be very easy, so you might want to have a local cab number on hand, or pre-arrange your return trip. 

Public transportation, especially in the day time, is another option. The 201 bus has a stop near the MGM and Excalibur (at Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana), and takes you to a stop very close to the Pinball Hall of Fame, between South Maryland and South Eastern. The fare is $2 each way.",5.0

"Having not been out in Willoughby before, I'd still heard of Olivor Twist.  It's obviously a staple and has a good reputation.  I just don't think that reputation is keeping up with the times.

We arrived as a large party, and I'll be honest-service was good.  The drinks were fine too.  What wasn't fine was the food.  My crab pizza was actually ""gross"".  I've never said that about pizza before!  It was frozen crab meat on an oily crust and laid in a bed of more oil?!???  I honestly think they were trying to mask the point that it didn't even taste like crab with olive oil.  (See my photo-I'm not exaggerating!) Some other reviews on the table were ""average"", ""overpriced"", ""just ok"", ""not worth my $70 bill"", and ""obviously a frozen ravioli from CostCo"".  

There are plenty of better options nearby.  Don't bother with Olivor Twist unless you're just there for drinks.",2.0

"My new go to for Taiwanese dessert :)!

I wouldn't call this a sit down place or take it place. Maybe a bit of both? There is someone in the front trying to sit people. People eat here pretty quickly, its like an in and out place. It was pretty cool how they had those machines that buzz when your food is ready to be picked up from the counter. It said it was long range beeper.. I wonder how far it could go.. Anyways.. I tried their signation grass jelly with taro balls and tapioca. It was pretty good! Not too sweet in my opinion, but that's also cause I have a sweet tooth. My companion found it a bit too sweet. They don't have a lot of choices on their menu. A few varieties of dessert and some drinks. It really is just Taiwanese dessert. The taro balls were not too big, just a good size. Portions were also generous. One bowl filled both of us up after having dinner a few hours previously. Open til late every night :) so that's a plus!

"Quite underwhelming. I feel like ramen is pretty simple, and this restaurant managed to present very mediocre bowls of noodles. I ordered a small with bbq duck, chicken, and choy. The picture on the menu displayed upwards of 10 slices of meat and at least 5 stalks of vegetables. What I ended up with was about 4 slices of meat and maybe 2 tiny stalks of greens. I also found the noodles slightly undercooked. Overall, the meal could've been much better. 

I will say that service was extremely fast. We got our orders in two minutes, so we were in and out within half an hour. However, there are much better places to fill up on noodles.",2.0
"OMG, I could eat every meal here! 

It was our last day and didn't want to be in the buffet line, way too long so I'm glad it forced us to go to Bardot :) We sat at the bar and got to look around, people watch ;)

Hubby got the steak brekkie and I got the lobster croissant benedict. OMGOMGOMG! I'm still day dreaming over it. Salivating as I type. It was perfect. Croissant was still crunchy, the sauce was divine, lobster pieces were generous. I wolfed it down! Oh so goooooood! I'm back in Vegas in Oct so I can't wait! I regrettably gave my hubby a bite. Even though I had a bite of his steak, the lobster benedict eclipsed the taste of the steak that I can't even remember what it was like. 

I also noticed that they have lots of baked goods on display. I loved that they had canele. Yum! I'm grateful that the bartender let me try one as the display had not been changed. I got one worthy to play hockey with. He was very apologetic and appalled. He went to the kitchen and got fresh ones. Didn't get compensated but at least I got an apology.

This place is on my list to 'must try'!",5.0

"Going to Durant's is like stepping back in time where the lighting was a bit darker, the booths leather, and the wallpaper a dark red with velvet. You get to the restaurant by walking through the kitchen which starts off your experience. You don't see many people on their cellphones and you can even find a pay phone in the restaurant. 
Durants reminds me of dinner my mom use to talk about how they would last a bit longer. Your appetizers were brought out and you didn't get your salads until you were finished so expect to spend some time. People here are enjoying the slower pace and the extremely attentive wait staff and having fun talking to each other. 
They start you off with some raw vegetables and then bring you this garlic bread that's covered in butter ( delicious). 
We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was very good, the breeding was very light and the calamari cooked perfectly. My friend and I both got the prime rib which was cooked perfectly and it was so easy to cut. We both got the garlic mashed potatoes and shared a side of asparagus which came with a delicious hollandaise sauce. The horseradish sauce was great as well. I opted to pay a little extra and get the Cesar salad which was good but their house salad looked perfect with dark greens (not typical ice berg). We shared the creme brûlée for desert where you get a sample of three kinds; an amaretto, berry, and a chocolate. My favorite was the amaretto

"Went to this place for this first time on Saturday and it definitely won't be the last time.  The staff are very kind and are very welcoming.  Our party had ordered some appetizers but a kitchen ""glitch"" had occurred so our waitress (Tanya, who is amazing!) came to us to explain that they will be served with our meals.  She was very apologetic about it and even offered to cover the apps herself.  We were all saying that her sincere apology was enough but for her to offer to cover the apps was just really kind of her.  On top of that, (who I believe was) the Manager also came to our table to apologize.  All this happened early in the night and already we were impressed.  

[Beverages]
Sangria - Not a big fan of sangria but this one was very very good.  It was actually made instead with pineapple juice which is probably why I liked this one.  If I didn't have the same tolerance for alcohol as a slug, then I would've had my own glass rather than just take sips.  

[Starters]
Onion Chips - If you like the Blooming Onion at food festivals, you may also like this.  It's a lot lighter and comes with some kind of dip that looked and tasted like chipotle mayo.  I didn't have much only because it wasn't my order, and I tried it much later when it had already cooled down.  I would assume it's much better tasting when it's fresh. 4/5

Ahi Tuna Wontons - Hands down, one of the best apps I've ever tasted.  Not overly flavoured but was flavoured enough.  If you want a lighter meal, I'd recommend this one.  Maybe get another side to go with it. 5/5

[Mains] 
BBQ Chicken Pizza - Other than the BBQ Chicken Pizza at CPK (California Pizza Kitchen), this one is very good, maybe even better since the pizzas are baked in a coal fired oven.  Crust is nice and crispy and the kicker or the ""icing on the cake"" with this pizza would be the roasted corn.  5/5

Neptune Pizza - If you love seafood, I highly recommend this pie. It comes with tiger shrimp and smoked salmon. Garnished with fresh arugula, capers that roast nicely and drizzled with a nice balsamic.  It is by far one of the best pies I've ever tasted.  I'd go back just for this pizza. 5+/5

Penne A La Vodka - Big serving of this very simple pasta dish.  Had a pretty good ratio between the pasta itself and the chicken and mushroom.  Had the right amount of cheese as well so it wasn't overly rich. 4/5

BBQ Baby Back Ribs - A great meal for a big meat eater.  Ribs were perfectly prepared as it was quite tender and just fell off the bones.  The sauce was also very nice though it could've used a little more flavouring.  Otherwise, it was still very very good.  5/5

Mushroom Linguini - My friend ordered this dish and she opted out of the bacon so SHE lost some brownie points with me.  The dish on the other hand was very tasty with the right amount of heat.  Definitely something I'd order myself in one of my future visits. 4/5",5.0
"My husband and I met Erica through the expectant moms group she co-hosts in Cambridge on Monday nights. We liked her thoughtful and nonjudgmental perspective on pregnancy and birth from the get-go. So when we came to the decision to hire a doula for our birth, there was no question that it was Erica we wanted by our side. Luckily, she was available!

We met with Erica several times before the birth. She listened to our needs and worries and helped us create a comprehensive birth plan. From the beginning, she was full of helpful resources, from belly mapping info and baby-positioning exercises to hypnobirth recordings and suggested reading materials. 

Our son was 9 days late, and Erica was very accessible and helpful in supporting our goal of avoiding induction, even when the doctors were pushing pretty hard for it. She suggested acupuncture to encourage labor and provided a list of recommended acupuncturists -- and I honestly think that was what helped get labor started (contractions began 12 hours after I got poked!).

My labor lasted about 20 hours -- and I'm not sure if I would have had the unmedicated experience I did if not for Erica. She was absolutely essential to achieving the birth I wanted. She gave us space during the early laboring we did at home, then arrived just in time for us to head to the hospital. Throughout the rest of labor, she was as present as she needed to be. When I got fatigued, she always had a new position for me to try. She made sure my husband ate and took breaks when he needed them. She was there with massage techniques and essential oils at the most important moments. She was never overbearing or pushy, just supportive, encouraging, knowledgeable and kind.

Erica's photography is the icing on the cake of her services. It's entirely optional, of course, but I absolutely recommend having her snap a few shots when she can! After having her there though the labor, it seemed perfectly natural for her to capture the first moments my husband and I spent with our new son. I almost cried when we got the pictures. They were so beautiful! We'll treasure them forever, along with our amazing birth experience -- all thanks to Erica.",5.0

I hardly ever go to any of those malls, and of course, those are the only locations of Lombardo's.  Oh well. I guess that leaves this delicious little gelato spot as a treat for every now and then. 

Last time I went to Fiesta Mall, they had a cookies and cream flavor that was amazing.  But they also had a delicious pineapple flavor that tasted like the real deal and it even had chunks of pineapple in it. So good.  It was exceptionally hard to choose, but of course I went with the least healthy option- cookies and cream.

"Dr. Heffner is the absolute best! I will never go to anyone else. She makes it simple fast and painless! She's so sweet and makes it fun to go there rather than dreading it! She is overall AMAZING! Makes everyone look gorgeous, and best price I've seen for the work she does.",5.0
"This place is the definition of a cute little cafe. And what makes it cute? White-washed decor, baked goods, quaint rooms, and carefully selected household items on display and for sale.

It's simply calming - not an easy feat in this city.",5.0
Are you kidding me Waited an hour to get get a table. Then another 15 minutes and never got waited on. We won't be back!!!! WTF,1.0
"Absolutely hated it. Every reason that people dislike large gyms lives right here. I work out 5-6 days a week. Some weeks I am traveling 3 of those days. In all of the time I have put in at various gyms I have never had a worse experience. I'm not sure I will be allowed enough room for the list of complaints I have. To start things off they charge $15 for a day pass. FIFTEEN! Mind you the membership fee is only $10/month. Let me tell you what i got for my $15. 

This facility is huge. It has every machine that you could ever dream of. The problem is that there are 3 people for every machine. No one is cleaning machines when they leave them. I didn't see any employees cleaning machines, or the facilities for that matter either. I chose to go to a ""Real"" gym rather than just using my hotel gym because I needed a bench press for my workout. I spent 10 minutes attempting to stalk out an available bench without any luck, and continued to check back consistently the entire time I was in the gym. Despite my efforts I never got on a bench, or a preacher curl bench, or a cable machine, or any other station that was part of today's workout. At that point I considered changing my workout to Leg day, but I couldn't get on a squat rack either. Deciding that I was going to make the most of the situation I went to the Comparable exercise machines. That wait was not quite as awful, but it still sucked. I found myself rushing to the machines I needed in competition with someone else each time. I eventually just tried the ""Women's workout"" area. I was finally able to access dumbbells in there, but there was no bench press. What I did find were spills all over the floor that were being ignored, dumbbells, & kettle-bells strewn around the room and never re-racked. Women dodging each-other & trying not to trip over the random weights. This room was even so crowded that women were doing floor exercises in the middle of the cable machine. I was never able to complete my planned workout because I could not access the necessary equipment. Had I known that going in I would have just stayed at the hotel gym. 

I LOVE the gym. I LOVE my workouts. I'm not a timid girl who is intimidated by heavy weights, new environments, crowds, or hard workouts. It's a big part of my day that I really look forward to, but today was nothing short of awful. The only positive experience with Fitness Connection was that the kid at the front desk who accepted my $15 payment was a really nice guy. The rest of my experience was very disappointing. 

If you're into overcrowded gyms that overcharge you for one day of the most stressful workout environment available this is the place for you. For me, Fitness Connection has solidified my commitment to the neighborhood gym. It's after midnight and I am still mad at myself for not demanding a refund before leaving this place. I even came back to my hotel & suggested that they not recommend this gym to any other guests. I don't understand why anyone would walk through their doors more than once for any reason other than a refund.

No thank you, Fitness Connection.",1.0
"I've anticipated coming here for over a year. Overall, I think it was a worth while visit but it's definitely not a place I would visit regularly. It seemed many of the other guests were celebrating special occasions which make sense because this buffet does stand out. I have too many thoughts about my experience, both good and bad, so I thought I just lay it out. 

Positives 
+ Champagne served while you're waiting to be seated 
+ High-end menu selection not found in other buffets - unlimited lobster, caviar. Not one of those where you're rationed. Lobsters are full size, not the langostino variety. 
+ High quality food - large shrimp cocktail, jumbo king crab legs, fresh raw oyster, ripe fresh fruit 
+ Service - high touch attentive service - beverages refilled immediately. Napkins refolded every time I left the table and replaced when dirty. 

Negatives 
- Broiled lobster was over done and thus tough 
- Kind crab leg wasn't halved so you have to crack the legs. Not easy given the pointy spines and buttery sauce coating the legs . Had 1 leg and gave up. Maybe that was the objective. 
- $85 + tax and tip. Not for the faint of heart 
- Dessert selection was OK 
- Ambiance - stuffy dark old school steak house ambiance. Would have preferred for light, airy venue given this is Sunday brunch 
- Only offered on Sundays. Not the best day given we've already gorged ourselves the whole weekend and who wants to get stuffed right before they jump on a plane or car. With the LV - LA traffic, pretty much guarantees you'll be sitting in the middle of it by the time you're done.",4.0
"Stopped here for dinner on the patio while strolling in Little Italy and am so glad we did! Everything on their menu sounded delicious and was relatively healthy. We both opted for a scroll (stuffed roti) and upgraded our side to one of their signature salads. Everything was prepared beautifully and tasted just as good! This place clearly values offering quality service and a cool, inviting atmosphere. Whether you're looking for brunch, lunch, dinner or just drinks, this place is worth trying out.",5.0

"It's so much fun shopping in this big store! While it has a lot of regular dollar-store items, they also have a huge variety of goods priced above a buck (still very inexpensive, though) and such items are clearly marked with a price sticker. The merchandise ranges from food items with a heavy emphasis on Asian - especially Korean - food and beverages, to clothing, small appliances and electronics, toys, cosmetics, kitchenware and tableware, luggage, arts & craft supplies ... too may things to list here - even things like piñatas and wooden tortilla presses! Definitely come here and enjoy the bargains, the wide variety of goods including many unusual and hard-to-find Asian items, and the very friendly service of the personnel.",4.0
"Parking is still on my ""cons"" list but can usually park in the back or the garage for free. I still don't understand the need for the pay lots.
Union has been open for a few months now and I love it there. There is a coffee shop (Royal, it's wonderful) as well as some great locally owned shops like For the People, Bonafide Goods and Queen Creek Olive Mill.
There is a relatively new J. Crew, however it is a women's only store. 
So I liked it before and absolutely love it now!",5.0
Small studio with all hot classes. Every class differs depending on the teacher. Make sure to arrive early on peak hour classes to ensure you get a spot! I would give it 3.5 stars bc of the lack of yoga studios in Northern Mississauga. Reasonable prices.,3.0
"The people here are very rude they yelled at us for using headphone after telling us we could we asked a few time before getting on the floor. They're so restrictive like you can't backwards skate if everyone else is in a forward direction. This place truly should be marketed for elderly people. My friends and I walked in and felt out of place the moment me walk in. We didn't stay for more than 20min and most of that time was waiting for their ""special"" skate to end and was on the floor for less than 1 minute before this very rude and unprofessional work belittled us. They can get 1 star because their floor is decent. I will NEVER EVER WASTE MY MONEY AT THIS PLACE AGAIN.",1.0
"Fantastic tacos, I had the 3 for $10 option and tried the Chicken Hermanos tacos which were a mix of BBQ chicken and pineapple/red onion salsa. Great kick of spice on the chicken and the salsa balanced it our beautifully with a refreshing sweet flavour. Will definitely be back!",5.0
"I purchased a 2011 CSX. Not only are Acura's great cars, this location has great customer service. I've totally bought in to the story they are telling. I drove an hour to have my car serviced today. Why? Because I was treated so well when I purchased my car.

Carmen runs the show and clearly has a passion for Acura and customer service. My Family has been purchasing cars from this dealership and Carmen since the 1990's.

They also have a nice comfy lounge with WiFi, coffee, and TV.",5.0

"MINI North Scottsdale- kept pushing their own financing after I stressed several times, I had my own all ready approved. Friend went into drive the car for me, since I WORK, and he was basically ignored. And when given a ""out the door"" price, a ""mistake"" was made ...asked for a buyers order twice so I could send it to my bank... until I threatened to walk, did they give it to me...huh?...and then after, I wouldn't hand over my financial info, they said, that someone needed to come with me to the bank to get the cashier's check...whah??? Overall, it really started to feel like I was dealing with a smarmy car dealership... so passed. If I'm gonna spend $30K at your place, people at least be kind of nice.",2.0
"I've found my new favorite burger joint!! The 1St time I went to this place it was really busy, they had only been open for 2 days. My experience wasn't the greatest however I knew this place had grater potential. So I didn't give up and decided to give them another try!! 

I was lucky to speak with Adam one of the owner about my experience. He was glad that I spoke to him about the problem and offered to fix the issue!! Also I spoke with couple of the employees while I was there, they love working for Adam (owners) because of the passion they demonstrate for food drives them all !!!

I've always had a soft spot for burgers so I know when I find an excellent burger joint that's worth going back to!",5.0
"We got in a little late (around 9.30pm) so we decided to sit at the bar. The food is the same, some items are 50% from 9pm-midnight and I think the bar looks much nicer!

The menu has lots of french influence and everything we order was amazing As apetizers, we got:
- the raclette. The cheese was legit, but the food wasn't hot enough by the time we got it (they should use stone or metal dishes) and they didn't serve potatoes with the raclette (but that's fine, they don't claim to be a french bistro).
- the mushroom soup, which was perfect.

For the main meal, we got:
- the halibut fish. It was very tasty. However, I think the dish should have been served with more vegetables and the rice should probably have been placed on the side instead of underneath the fish.
- the risotto was very good. The carrot puree that came with it was also very good.

Finally we had the spanish coffee and truffle cake for desert, both were really yummy!

Overall it's a great place to eat. I heard the menu changes very often, so your mileage might vary depending on when you go.",4.0
"Summary: Excellent, knowledgable, caring physical therapists. Friendly, courteous, and competent assistants and receptionist. Everything all the other reviewers say is 100% true. 

I'm part way through PT for shoulder impingement and it's feeling a lot better, not 100%, but I do believe I will get there. Henry's my guy, and I have full confidence Steve is equally amazing. He's a wealth of knowledge and the only person who has ever been able to get rid of some long standing, stubborn muscle knots using dry needling (which I love, and hate at the same time!) and other active release techniques. He's persistent in trying to get my my shoulder to a pain-free state and my body back to a healthy state.

Ever so grateful to this team for their professionalism and their care.",5.0
"Hunger makes me desperate.
I mean, that's it really. The ONLY reason I ate anything from this place.
Because this place is where sub-par food reigns and good food is a complete unknown.

I ordered a BLT. 
YES. THEY SCREWED UP A BLT. 
There is very little actual cooking involved here, people.
And yet it was the worst BLT I've ever had.

Bread. Burnt.
Lettuce. Yellow-ish white in colour.
Bacon. Limp.
Tomatoes. Only thing decent.
Mayo. Liberal.

The BLT came with fries or hash browns.
I choose the fries. I really wish I didn't.
I loathe coated fries. Not much left to say after that.

As a parting gift, I now have a stomach ache.

All that for $5.99 plus tax.
What a deal.",1.0
