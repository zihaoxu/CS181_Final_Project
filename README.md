Zihao Xu, Yu Xuan Hong, Bingyan Ren

# Abstract  
In this project, we explored and performed sentiment analysis on reviews obtained from the Yelp Data Challenge. We explored temporal trends of review sentiment as well as interesting interactions between review tags. We also build a sentiment predictor for reviews solely based on text analysis. The resulting interactive module allows us to assess the sentiment of a unlabeled piece of review text with a confidence score.
