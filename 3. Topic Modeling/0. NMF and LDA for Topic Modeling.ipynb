      "ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  \n",
      "i was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, Worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.\n",
      "i ended up choosing the HH Famous Meatloaf with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the Farmer's Daughter House Hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  Both came on a huge skillet (which they called their \"smaller\" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  My other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with smoked salmon and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!\n",
      "this ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted pork tenderloin, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.\n",

As I have said before, if you want the world class five star resort experience go to the Las Vegas Strip, but if you want a taste of the Las Vegas of a bygone era, come Downtown. The Fremont Hotel Casino is a great example of that. Great deals on  Food, Room and Gambling (Low table Limits) Always a great way to try out your sure fire system on craps, with little risk. Come at night for the full blown neon experience. Come on down and let loose. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!\n",

The seats were up in the 300's but still good seats.  We could see everything just fine.  I'm not a big Beatles person so I only knew 2 or 3 of the songs plus I didn't really know the history of the Beatles so the story line was confusing.

I love how they had such a great selection on their gourmet food such as salami, proscuitto, olives, cheddar cheese, jack cheese, swiss cheese, bruschetta.  Their selection of juices were pretty good.  They also had a good selection of comfort foods like chicken noodle soup and pastas such as rigatoni and spaghetti.

Listened to what I wanted and gave her honest opinion also she did such a clean and precise job. She made sure to clean up all edges of my nails and gave me an amazing hand massage afterwards.
